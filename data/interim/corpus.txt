Kudos to whoever came up with these round tables, they're great.

There's a lot more interesting things about the moon's dimensions as well, much of which was known by ancient monument builders who made the pyramids at Giza as well as Stonehenge and many other sites.For example, the ratio of the Earth's diameter to the Moon's diameter is 11:3, or 7920:2160 miles. This ratio produces a phenomenon known to ancient geometers as squaring the circle. If you made a circle with a radius of the Earth's radius, plus the moon's radius, then that circle would have the same perimeter as a square drawn around the Earth:http://joedubs.com/squaring-the-circle/Basically, if the Moon were touching the Earth, then you could draw a circle with it's center at the center of the Earth, and it's edge passing through the center of the Moon, and that circle would have the same length around it's edge as a square perfectly enclosing the Earth. This relationship is illustrated in the great pyramid at Giza in the ratio of its height to its square base, and in the concentric rings at Stonehenge.This relationship would not be there if either the Earth or the Moon were a little bit bigger or smaller, and is even more amazing when you realize the significance of measuring these dimensions in miles. The ancient approximation of pi≈~~11/7~~ 22/7 is reflected in the radius of this large circle encompassing the Earth and the Moon with radius 5040 miles, or 7! (7x6x5x4x3x2x1) and the diameter of the Earth (or one side of the square) with length 7920 miles, or 11!/7! (11x10x9x8). So whoever came up with the measurement of the mile clearly had this relationship in mind.There's even more significance when you start to look deeper into the cosmic patterns of the universe, but the moon is just the start. Our ancient ancestors who designed not only the length of the mile, but also the foot, meter and cubit had these cosmic dimensions and ratios as their basis, as explained so well by Alan Greene, who recently did an AMA. True, the moon is amazing, but once you start to study the deeper patterns in the cosmos and the sacred geometry all around us in nature, it becomes clear that the moon is simply one of many amazing "coincidences" of proportion that seem too perfect not to be designed. My personal feeling is that the underlying structure of our universe itself is beautiful, fractal harmonic relationships, and as a result, everything in the manifest world reflects that.

I put this thread together for /r/conspiracy a few years back:[A Little List of Coincidence in the Solar System](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ugs5u/a_little_list_of_coincidence_in_the_solar_system/): Space, Geometry and the Golden Section. Do the planets hide a secret Harmony of the Spheres?

I love space related conspiracy. Great topic. 

Astronomer [Tom Van Flandern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Van_Flandern) and others have argued that there used to be a large planet between Jupiter and Mars (where the asteroid belt is today). Mainstream science doesn't entertain this possibility because there isn't a natural mechanism for the literal "explosion" of an entire planet.Van Flandern, undeterred, traced back the paths of scores of comets in our solar system, and discovered that many converged at the same time, and at the same location, at two points in the history of our solar system, with the most recent being approximately 2 million years ago. Other writers like Joseph P. Farrell (in his book *The Cosmic War*) offer a *technological* explanation for this major event, namely that this large, potentially earth-like object was *deliberately* destroyed, and even more hypothetically by a weaponized moon in our solar system.Van Flandern took it even further by speculating that "the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded "Planet V"."In support of this theory, some ancient cultures have lore that tells of ancient humans originating on Mars.If this interests anybody, I highly recommend reading *Dark Matter, Missing Planets & New Comets* by the late Van Flandern. He has an entirely new approach to gravity that honestly is quite stunning in its simplicity and implications.

The Hollow Phobos Hypothesis has significant evidence to back it up, which is a problem because, paraphrasing Carl Sagan, there isn't an accepted *natural* explanation for a hollow planetoid.[The Phobos Monolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_monolith) is also the subject of significant speculation.There has also been a curious history of failing equipment each time we get close to this enigmatic moon...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)#Shklovsky.27s_.22Hollow_Phobos.22_hypothesis

One thing I often wondered about was the difference between the Earth's 24hr day and our biological 25hr clock (put people in a room containing no natural light nor clocks, and they will naturally have 25hr sleep/wake cycles.)  What if some time ago the earth had a 25hr day, and some astronomical event slowed it down.  That would explain why our clock is off.  But when did it happen, and was the moon involved?

The one that I find most interesting is John Brandenburg and the evidence for prehistoric global nuclear warfare on Mars.  [Death on Mars by John Brandenburg](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Mars-Discovery-Planetary-Massacre/dp/193914938X)[Gordon White interviews Brandenburg on the skeptiko podcast](http://skeptiko.com/john-brandenburg-outsourced-ufo-research-325/)  [The first sentence on the Brandenburg page at rationalwiki:](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/John_Brandenburg) John E. Brandenburg is a plasma physicist who went somewhat off the rails in 2012 and started proclaiming that he saw clear evidence of a thermonuclear war on Mars in the distant past.

Let's try to factor in those [moon "wave" anomalies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVm99ur5lg) in here also.  Because to me, it looks like a hologram that's refreshing or something.  And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.

The Moon has 99% been a part of (or in the vicinity of) Earth since it's formation. The decay of the Helium isotopes matches up which means that the Helium atoms on Earth and the Helium atoms on the Moon have been close to each other since just about their formation. Another way of putting it is that both sets of Helium have experienced the same amount of time in the universe, which can only mean that they have travelled together. This is all pretty concrete and is the reason why the impact hypothesis is the currently accepted theory.UNLESS, the moon landings never happened and the "Moon Helium" is in fact terrestrial. 

Ah, classic /r/conspiracy. How much I have missed you and these threads. I love you guys. :) 

I don't believe this enormous 'tower' photographed by the Soviets in 1965 was ever explained https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexplainedPhotos/comments/47upry/the_mysterious_tower_on_the_far_side_of_the_moon/Is it a glimpse into the far side of the moon?

I just had a random thought, what if the total eclipse on August 21st will be used to implement some form of Project Blue Beam? EVERYONE will be looking at the sky in the states...

The secret is the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Look at Tethys and Minas's heat signatures, what does pacman eat? Ghosts.

Is it possible that because of the sheer size of everything, that there is a "zone" in which the moon could reside to give us the same eclipse effect?  I've heard astronomers describe it like if the moon were 100 miles nearer or further it wouldn't give the same effect.

Here's a conspiracy that will be hated. Maybe there is a god/creator of the universe. And this planet is perfectly designed to support life?

The moon is 400 times smaller than the sun while being 400 closer to the earth than the sun, giving us perfect solar eclipses. That's pretty convenient.

Here is something relevant I posted a couple weeks ago. **NASA VIDEO EVIDENCE of the astronauts faking shots of "Earth at a distance" during the Apollo missions, while they were still very much in low Earth orbit.**Because once you realize that we may have never passed LEO, questions about the moon become much more valid. Another angle of thought is that we went to the moon, found out something that was  too much to tell the public, so we filmed and faked an alternate moon reality (NASA's moon footage) and have been presenting that to the public ever since.______The following evidence represents an extremely important moment caught on camera that I believe has never been adequately addressed by NASA or any NASA supporter. In my opinion it is equivalent to what the “WTC7 collapsing” footage is to the 9/11 truth movement.It comes from the documentary “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon” but I am not trying to convince anyone of anything from an obviously biased documentary. Be skeptical of all of it. I encourage that. When this clip plays in the documentary there is a narrator but, again, I am telling you to completely ignore that voiceover if it pleases you.Simply use your eyes and use your brain and look at what I am about to show you. I am purposely separating the most important footage from the documentary and its bias, muting the narrator, and breaking the clip up into very short digestible gifs. Lets start.Does this look like the Earth to you? Would you assume that this is a shot from the far reaches of space, looking back at Earth from a distance?http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-P6L-AaPretty convincing right? Lets look at more footage of “Earth at a distance”:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-2BRu4xZooming in the camera which we can only assume is pushed up against a shuttle window, pointed out at the Earth in the blackness of space:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-fnU3AeOkay, this shot is even better. Notice that you cannot really make out any continents? Notice that you see no stars? But for the sake of argument, lets just completely ignore that for now. Take a look:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-xaWNX2I mean, thats definitely the Earth right? And you would have to be far beyond Earth (on the way to the moon) to get footage like that, correct? Again, no recognizable continents, No stars. But again, for the sake of argument, lets allow science to explain that.But wait, how exactly does this happen? http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-TTDLgtWait, isn’t the camera pressed against the window and zoomed in? Because they are far from Earth right, at least this far, correct? If they zoomed that camera back out.http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-aRd5qGBut wait a minute, wtf is that? Is that the sun?http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-KRP8WaHold on. Wut? Here is a longer gif just to make the strangeness very clear.http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-pVgTUTIs that a… work light? Of enormous size and floating in space?Wait a minute, whats going on? http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-0cFJWXReady to have your mind completely shattered? Look:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-H8tierSo wait, what? Yeah, that “Earth at a distance” was a clever camera trick. They used the circular shuttle window and the small part of the enormous Earth showing through that small circular window. Camera tricks and the illusion of a little “Earth ball” at a distance.As you can see here, they are very close to Earth. Like “Low Earth Orbit” close. And yes, that was a work light. You can now see it clearly. And that blackness was a darkened shuttle interior. Again:http://makeagif.com/gif/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-moon-bXHv0J Or… I don’t know. I am willing to entertain any ideas or thoughts on this.And let me set the record straight once and for all:Do you personally subscribe to any “Flat Earth” or “alternate Earth models”?— NODo you believe in the ISS and Mars rover missions?— YESDo you believe that you can shine a laser at a retroreflector on the moon?— YES, because the unmanned soviet [Lunokhod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_programme) program left retroreflectors there.What about the other evidence: moon rocks, etc…?— I am not sure honestly, I do not feel like I have studied enough to make a decision.So what are you trying to prove then?— I am simply pointing out that there is unusual footage of what appears to be the astronauts filming a disingenuous “Earth”. I find the footage fascinating and would love to know more about it. I would love to see the unedited footage and I would love to see the extended footage.How do we know this is real NASA footage?— Because NASA included it in their Apollo 11 DVD set. Why, I don’t know. But people definitely thought that pointing that out would somehow make my brain stop comprehending what it saw.As a matter of fact, [here is a website that appears to be trying to debunk that footage](http://www.clavius.org/bibsibrel.html), scroll to the bottom.This is their explanation:_____What Mr. Sibrel supplies is footage of the astronauts practicing for an upcoming telecast. **Because television was added at the last minute, they hadn't had time to practice much with the equipment. So they were experimenting with different camera positions and exposure settings**. Someone on the ground recorded it. Mr. Sibrel notes several observations which he can't explain in terms of his expectations, therefore he concludes the astronauts "must" have been faking it. That's it. That's his "smoking gun."_____And finally, here is [the TIMESTAMPED section of “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon”](https://youtu.be/xciCJfbTvE4?t=32m20s) if this post piqued your interest. Once again, take everything said by the narrator with a grain of salt. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything other than what their eyes see and the conclusions their brain reach while watching that particular footage that I made gifs from. I personally have a hard time wrapping my brain around what form of “context” could possibly explain it. 

When the Earth was Moonless:http://www.halexandria.org/dward200.htm

The other day I was reading through this thread and someone linked to a story about NASA sending 2 secret Apollo missions to the moon who made contact and were murdered by an alien life form.But now I can't find it. Anyone help me out with a link?

Does anyone know for what purpose would people lie about the Earth being round?  I look at a lot of conspiracy theories but the flat Earth one kind of shows how easily it is to convince people of whatever you want.

Here's Richard Hoagland's article on Saturn's moon Iapetus:[A Moon with a View](http://enterprisemission.com/moon1.htm)Other researchers [have pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/246tud/you_can_relax_now_that_mysterious_equatorial/) that the massive and mysterious "equatorial ridge" around Iapetus has yet to be fully explained or understood, not to mention the abundance of seemingly organized geometric shapes on its surface.

Expanding on the "spaceship moon" hypothesis, writer Don Wilson has written several books on the subject.[Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon](http://www.cseti.org/Our%20Mysterious%20Spaceship%20Moon/coverpage.htm) is available to read online (I highly recommend it...I spent over $50 for a physical copy), as well as [Secrets of Our Spaceship Moon](http://auricmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Don_Wilson_Spaceship_Moon.pdf) (pdf).Another popular book on this subject is [Who Built the Moon?](http://www.whobuiltthemoon.com/)

God I missed shit like this.

The Earth is a Black Dwarf Star (burned-down star) and all the elements present here were home-grown.[13 minute video from Bill Gaede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fINLrXi54zA)

We are developing plans for catching asteroids and placing them into orbit around destination planets/moons for use of a depot station and middle ground in expeditions and resource harvesting.When I read this the moon made sense.  It's designed.  Perfect distance and rotational speed: always one side facing us.Pink Floyd must have known something.The topic of moon landing validity falls at the feet of the video proof.My grandfather was a mathematician for NASA and worked on the mission.  We definitely went there.My theory: the video is the original fake news.  What we discovered about or on the moon, it was decided, did not fit the narrative.If the moon was placed there... possibly as a depot station... by who?Anyone else got anything on this?The anunnaki and their desire for gold come to mind._orion

This is the shit that keeps me going

So what's the deal with this force field I keep hearing about? A friend in person told me there might be a force field trapping everyone on Earth? Something about the Anunnaki using humans to try and break out of it

3 min video: https://youtu.be/qYW4rTrAA5ITl;dw There is water on the moon.The moon also has an atmosphere. Google it.There is also greenery.Read Ingo Swanns book Penetration. You can find a free pdf online. Or check out my sub r/projectstargate to lesrn more.The moon is an artificial satellite. There is overwhelming evidence for this.

Before It Was Brought Here. The Earth Without The Moon:https://www.varchive.org/itb/sansmoon.htm

The Moon is an artificial object that was flown to it's current location.

[The ancient time on Earth without a Moon.](https://www.varchive.org/itb/sansmoon.htm). A Moon either being brought here or built here (by an advance Creator(s)) could explain the Great Deluge and the numerous underground dwellings and cities, among the other anomalies of the moon (ie size ratio to Earth, and the pefectness of all proportions - not to far, not to close - just right distance to the sun, etc etc). I have a wacky thought that maybe the souls of Humans (who do not ascend) pass through the hollow Moon, and those who do ascend pass through the Hollow Earth. Hence why they call people "lunatics" and why people act freaky during a full moon in the night (ie. the freaks come out at night).

Is this the round table? Or is this the announcement for round table coming?

[Under the Masonic Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3er7IZLRek)

Check out "Aliens on the Moon: The Truth...". It's available on Netflix.

Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun? I personally am agnostic due to the insane amount of coincidences like this but I'd like to know this, because space is a very real and fact (math)-based science.Regarding this: >There is no astronomical reason why the Moon and the Sun should fit so well. It is the sheerest of coincidences, and only the Earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion.

I really like this article that explains the craters on the moon:http://www.thunderbolts.info/webnews/120707electriccraters.htmElectric Universe all the way.

all 4 rocky planets (mercury, venus and mars) could haveonce hosted life. the secret is melting the core. you can do that by simply moving the planet closer to the sunand wait. once you melt the core you get a magnetic field.not only that, planets may be growing in size(look for the growingearth theory) if this is true. mercury may become the next venus.venus may become the next earth. and as we all know earth will be the next mars. the only planet we have left is mars. if we want to make it life supportive we need alien advance technology to move it wheremercury is now. the it will spin faster than it should (einstein solve this)and it may gain back its liquid core, magnetic field, grow a littlecover itself in hot magma, and the cicle continues. thats my theory. 

The moon is a Hollow Alien Spacecraft:1)http://www.disclose.tv/news/the_biggest_secret_of_our_solar_system_is_our_moon_an_alien_spacecraft/1365172)http://scariestbookofalltime.blogspot.com/2010/01/no-moon-prior-to-11713-years-ago.html

There is also the theory that Zecharia Sitchin puts forth, that the Moon was actually a satellite of a different planet. To parallel the Tiamat vs Marduk story.http://www.sitchinstudies.com/the-sumerian-solar-system.html

The moon fits perfectly into the sun. How could that be?  Very simple, the thinking about the moon needs to change, stop assuming it is a giant rock, planet, or whatever. Think of it as 'the back of the sun' or a projection created by the sun. They are, in fact, the same entity, but that doesn't mean the moon doesn't have unique properties, such as the ability to cool objects exposed to moonlight. It is not a "place" you can visit, but the sun itself reflected, somehow.

Probably should have called this thread "Strictly for Professional Lunatics" lolWe know other planets have moons, both in our own solar system as well as in other systems in our galaxy but absolutely none of them have a moon that is anywhere as big as ours is in comparison to the size of the Earth itself. So that presents a curious anomaly as well as raising an interesting question about how the Earth could have initially attracted and held on to such a large moon when we have no other planets with moons that come anywhere close to being as big as they themselves are as we do and probably shouldn't have been able to do in light of that. That of course leads to the question about what the Moon itself and it's interior is made of and all the conjecture surrounding whether it may actually be hollow or not. Another interesting consideration is whether or nor what we have called and believed to be "craters" produced by meteors, may have actually been the result of some kind of violent and gaseous volcanic activity in the moon's distant past which would look pretty much the same when you look at and think about it from that perspective. You might want to cook and pay attention to a pot of oatmeal to get yourself into the mood for that. lol

Nah.. I was expecting for Gobekli Tepe..

The moon is what causes tidal forces on the oceans and gravitational pull in the earths core thus keeping the planet alive. I wouldn't be surprised if the moon was the original Noah's ark. Sounds fucking crazy lol

The Moon is your yin self. It is ever-changing from full to transparent. It is equal in size to the Sun, your yang self. That Moon and that Sun are yours alone. Both are conceptual manifestations of you. Neither entirely exists physically. They are right above you, inside the dome, you are inside your very own plane-ette of experience. The Sun appears as your corona, where a single point of intention to exist meets infinite non-existent potential erupting in bright heated light. The Moon is infinite manifest non-existence, manifest as existence. You are in between your Sun and your Moon on a plane-ette of experience, where all you see or know is self overlain on infinite individualities. All you see or know is your self externalized onto infinity from within a time-space conceptualization that is designed to keep you individual and sane within an infinite non existent conception.

Great book alert for this topic:  "Who Built the Moon" by Alan Butler. YL;DR: great analysis arguing that our moon had to be built by some form of intelligent life.

This was a great discussion thank you. I look forward to the next one. 

> Saturn's moon Iapetus (the "Death Star") has also been the subject of some of this high octane speculationSo Revelation Space? (It's a good read, with this very concept) - In regards to Iapetus being hollow - the density is slightly higher than that of pure water ice. If it were hollow, it would need to be able to sustain the same mass/size ratio as though it were another iceball. Tethys is in this same density category, as are most small moons around Saturn, and its rings are all pretty much particles around that same density too. (hovering around 1 g/cm^3)So just remember folks - nature doesn't have an agenda the same way that human beings vying for power do. It can be tested and doesn't intentionally hide anything.Coming from a background in astronomy and working in geosciences department, researchers are just normal people who use software to build models. There's enough material online you can learn the science on your own and use the same Python libraries [used by professionals](http://www.astropy.org/) - And all public funded projects have public data after a set time. So go crunch the numbers! I think the most controversial work out there is in ETI detection from huge data sets. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03031) is an interesting approach that needs a lot further work.Could it be hollow? Sure, but if you're looking for a juicy conspiracy, there's more than enough happening with the Deep State right now.

Topics in this sub have been bangers lately. Keep it coming. Links and all.

Why are we trusting science fiction writers to put something in the "best" way about a real celestial body?> In the 1970's, two Soviet scientists proposed an alternative theory: Earth's moon may be a hollowed out spaceship.How does that explain it's density?

I don't usually comment here, but I will in this instance. It is a spectacular coincidence that total solar eclipses can happen right when humans are alive. Millions of years from now, the Moon will be farther away from Earth. It gets about 4cm farther from Earth every year, so millions of years from now it'll be so far that it'll look smaller in the sky and won't be able to block all of the Sun's light. If you run this in reverse, that means the Moon was closer in the past. In the distant past it was in the same place as Earth, meaning it came from Earth. Giant impact is really the only logical explanation to these observationsEdit: letters

I follow suit with the ship hypothesis with a way out their notion. I think it is the key to reincarnation. Our consciousness is nothing more than the sun providing the energy to the moon. The farther(sun) provides the seed to the womb of the mother(moon), giving birth to the holy ghost(earth)

the amount of shills here is wild. you can tell we hit something with this talk. 

I think we went to the moon , but faked all the footage shown to the public. I just can't see our paranoid cold war government giving away anything that could have been a tactical advantage to the USA. You had this absolutely batshit crazy paranoia about communists and you want me to believe that we were just going give away information about out advanced space vehicles, lunar modules, first photos of the moon etc. to the "commies" .  This sort of explains the Kubrick theory, and all the fake moon rocks.

This is a globe.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6rqr3x/this_is_a_globe_re_rconspiracy_round_table_3_the/

Tethys and Minas are also death stars. EDIT: Look at their heat signature, pacman eats ghosts, death stars are stars of death....

The moon has an equal chance of or being a flat somewhat translucent disc. There is documented stars being seen through the unlit portion of the moon. We also know it is much smaller due to the shadow size being approx 70miles  in the upcoming eclipse.Interesting stuff, more interesting is that mainstreamed science won't touch this possibility. Likely to continue to cover up the moon landing hoax. 

there are lots of movies, songs and shows lately that speak about the end. it's well past 2012 so i don't think it has anything to do with that. i think something really is coming. kanye tried to tell people the truth recently and he got taken off to the hospital by handcuffs....bieber has been going to bible study and he cancelled his tour. idk. things just seem weird. i just heard harry styles song "sign of the times" and i can't get it out of my head. i know this is kind of off topic but predictive programming is 100% real and we need to talk more about it. 

well there's good 'evidence' of underground cavern systems on the moon but i like the idea it's a huge hollowed out space ship. Easy to test I guess with usa, china, russia, and everyone wanting to go there to exploit/ experiment/ prove concept. 

Breath of fresh air isn't it.

Whoever built the pyramids had a [clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.](http://blog.world-mysteries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GreatPyramid_Blueprint.jpg) But what is astounding to me is that the earth and the moon are so perfectly balanced. Why did these ancient cultures [know the shape and size of these bodies thousands of years ago?](http://blog.world-mysteries.com/mystic-places/decoding-giza-pyramids-part-3/) And WHY do the Earth, Sun, Moon have these  [mathematic relationships?](https://i0.wp.com/joedubs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/108-Earth-Sun-and-Moon.jpg)[Here is some more interesting info](http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/2016/01/20/the-metre/) about our units of measurement and their relationships to the moon.Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always, and is the PERFECT distance and size from the earth to eclipse the sun, it seems like the moon is the most likely candidate for an artificial satellite. But it still blows my mind as to HOW and WHY??There are harmonious mathematical relationships between many of the other planets as well. [Here's the astounding relationship between Earth and Venus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFDBeTdPKig)And [here's another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcJiRmZ9WmY) that shows the relationships between all the other planets in the solar system.

This is an interesting relationship that I hadn't seen before. It's interesting except for one small detail. Pi is approximated as 22/7, not 11/7. 22/7 ≈ 3.1428...

Thanks for this! Should be a great lead up to the eclipse in three weeks!!

Simulation theory confirmed!

Thank you very kindly for this information. Wonderful rabbit hole to delve into. And thanks for making sticky threads on topics that are considered as "fringe" as this one. Very refreshing to see on this sub (especially with all the politics garbage dominating the front page).

Glad to see someone mentioning Van Flandern.  Also important to mention that he hypothesized that planets & moons are "born" out of a fission process:https://youtu.be/eu0K_7q_xEI?t=3851This is the only theory I'm aware of that really makes sense with Velikovsky's conclusion that Venus was ejected from Jupiter (the red spot).

I find this CIA experiment with ~~Ingo Swann~~ don't remember who it was, but may have been, to be interesting and relevant:The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result. https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdfThe Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.Here is what it looks like on Google Earth (Mars): http://imgur.com/a/TL4m9The mountain there is the famous "Face on Mars": https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast24may_1/Google has an easter-egg chatbot there on the mountain (called MELIZA): http://googlesystem.blogspot.ch/2009/02/chat-with-martian-in-google-earth-5.htmlMore CIA docs on psychics:An Experiment into the Psychic Magnification Effect: https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000300420008-1.pdfAn Experimental Psychic Probe of the Planet Jupiter: https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100040010-3.pdfResearch in Human Paranormal Capabilities: https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000300330001-8.pdfAn Assessment of the Evidence for Psychic Functioning: https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00791R000200070001-9.pdfA dossier discussing Project GRILL FLAME.

Isn't it established that a planet *was* supposed to be there but Jupiter's gravity kinda prevented the accretion?Quick wikipedia:>The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[7] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[7][8] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt

It could have been destroyed by a gamma ray burst or perhaps an extremely temporary occurrence of  strange matter collision that caused the annihilation of Planet V. 

Literally the plot of "Inherit the Stars", ca 1977.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_series

hmm.. couldnt find the equiptment failing part, but in the wiki said:The density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[57] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[57] In addition, images obtained by the Viking probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one.  :(

The cardiac cadence/circadian rhythm and biological clock conform almost precisely to the Martian day.

The Earth spun faster in the past. 

It seems as though newer studies put it back closer to 24 hours:http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour/

unfortunately for that theory, the old days were shorter.  length of the day is increasing over time. hence the leap seconds.  my internal clock goes on 36hs, but neither my wife nor my boss want me to sleep 12hs longer each day ;-)

Or maybe humans are originally from another planet that has 25 hour day and has much better ecosystem for humans. Who knows maybe Atlantis or Garden of Eden are not places or cities on Earth in the past but actual Planets in our Galaxy or beyond...

> and some astronomical event slowed it downWhich would happen when the earth has grown since. 

if there is a civ that able to make nuclear, of course they would able to make bunker as well, and to debunk those prehistoric nuclear warfare on mars, someone simply need to find those bunker in the future or mars exploration

My guess is that this wave anomaly is from a cloak that hides whats on the moon.  Or maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirely, and only made to look like a rock in space.

Better video that shows 10 wave captures and discusses them from someone who shot the first one.  Also tells how he was attacked by official sources.  He has many videos talking about this and what it may mean.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM

Really?  I read an in depth explanation on how this "wave" anomaly *was* caused by the camera.  I'll have to dig for the post.edit:  found the possible explanation.https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuav6y/Unless that's been debunked I thinks it's a very reasonable explanation.

I think it's a similar effect like asphalt on a hot day. The ground looks wavy and moving.The atmosphere has an amount of heat I'd assume(even at night) but since it's at such a large scale the waves aren't as extreme

My vote is refraction from shifting air density in Earth's atmosphere.

what in the actual fuck !  its like someone turned V-sync off on the moon lol, on a serious note though, any scientific explanation / debunking to this ?

Hologram theory is interesting, but people need to remember it's not the government, it is some other intelligence or "creator" who is showing us that hologram, this is part of the theory that we are essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project. The other about moon waves is more simple, and biblical, which is that space is water, and we are lied to about it. As above, so below. God separated the waters from the waters. I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lot. Look at space, planets, stars in a telescope and you see it all looks like it's  lights under water. Astronauts train in water, their suits are built to exist in water. The deepest sea dive ever recorded that they found water within water, a shore with waves underneath the ocean and they simply bounced off when trying to submerge in the secondary pool. 

Can't watch the video, but had this shower thought: could it be a Schlieren effect from a plane passing by?

[Here is a youtube channel that is all about that](https://www.youtube.com/user/Crrow777/videos)

What the fuck 

Some think these make the moon look holographic, but I think the moon is hollow, and that vibration is like when you ring a bell and the surface vibrates. NASA states that when they landed on the moon it [rang like a bell!](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/15mar_moonquakes.html)

The moon is an astral body. And we are dreaming. Our Physical reality is built with a template that reflects our state of what we call dreaming. So in a sense everything is from that template and it's product though it seems solid, is actually the dream manifest.Especially light bodies in space. These bodies receive influx of energy to maintain their form. Just like we do. Only we don't analyze how our own energy field ripples. It does, just like the moon's energy field. It's template reality.

Is there footage of said anomaly taken from space?

Why could this video not be faked, just like NASA faking theirs?

My god that is terrifying.  I got actual chills watching that, and the feeling that I...shouldn't have been seeing it.  Like something out of Lovecraft.  Never even heard of this before either, thanks man

many people are now seeing the moon glitch and change shape as well as refresh like a computer projection

**WTF Clouds behind our Sun and Moon ?**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgnVRdQ7wg0

Could those waves be something closer, a part of our atmosphere?They are cool, though.

Not, being a dick, but can you provide link for debunks, curious.

Where else have you seen a "hologram refresh" , what makes you believe that?Why do you believe that "camera artifacts" can be debunked, but not that it being a hologram be debunked, because that has been debunked a thousand times over

> And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.I'm gonna go with the explanation that it's definitely either the camera or an artifact. That or maybe it's hot air in front of the camera.

Those are fraudulent.  Observe the moon with your own equipment and you will never see one.

This is a great comment, it should have responses.The UNLESS is very intriguing here.

I can't help but wonder if it's a property marker, much like these....https://duckduckgo.com/?q=obelisk&t=ffsb&iax=1&ia=images

the far side of the moon would, in fact, be the face of the sun. I believe they would align perfectly.

cool, might as get this over with

The moon doesn't orbit in a perfect circle around the earth.  Sometimes it's closer, some times it's further away. In fact, the difference between the closest and farthest points is about 30,000 miles.This does have an appreciable effect on how big the moon appears, and can even make it appear noticeably smaller than the sun.  An [annular eclipse](https://www.google.com/search?q=annular+eclipse&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPlJWIs7zVAhUG0mMKHdG6D8YQ_AUICigB&biw=1600&bih=794) is when the moon eclipses the sun, but is close to the far point in its orbit.  This makes the moon smaller than the sun in the sky, allowing a ring of sunlight to pass around the moon (this ring is called an annulus).

No, it would have to be much much more than 100 miles. 100 miles is nothing.Also the moon doesn't stay the same distance all around the earth, just as the earth isn't always the same distance from the sun. During a perfect solar eclipse, the moon doesn't quite cover the whole sun as we still see a kind of halo around the moon. If they were the exact same size in the sky we wouldn't get that.

now I know a lot of Christians don't believe in aliens due to not being explicitly written in the Bible, but my theory is that if God designed the Earth to be so full of all sorts of diverse lifeforms, why would he leave the rest of the Universe barren of other life? Surely he would populate them with all sorts of unique life as to reflect His glory. After all, human curiosity has taken us to journey out of the Earth. What good would this curiosity do if there was nothing to find out there?

ironically, nowadays that in itself is a crazy conspiracy theory to a lot of people :P, but one i agree with, although i do hope other planets with life exist and that god didn't decide to stop with us for some reason. 

i believe A god made it. or rather a very intelligent being and we are the product of a large science experiment and we aren't the only ones. and other planets in our solar system have undergone the same testing. mostly mars 

The moon is actually drifting away, what's "convenient" is that we get to see it at a time when it appears to be approximately the same size as the sun.

The chance of that occurring by accident is much more incredible than most people realize.

They're not that perfect. Only for those right in the path of the shadow.http://www.eclipse2017.org/2017/maps/whole-us.jpg

It is also ludicrously unlikely!

Well no one complains about the odds of evolution which is just as unlikely.  

Great post. 

perhaps they did fake the Moon landing in order to prove to the public that the Moon is uninhabited when in fact it is settled by other civilizations. William Tompkins stated in his book that when Apollo 11 landed in Tranquility, there were huge alien warships circled around the edge of the crater. later they used other films to show to the public broadcast instead. then with the alien's permission the apollo program sent several other missions before being barred from coming back again

Religious reasons, they think the earth being round is the number one thing in history that leads people away from god, and a flat earth would absolutely have to be designed

[deleted]

The purpose is to hide God. Read your bible,the sun wasn't made until the 4th day and it was made to give light to the earth. There is nothing in the bible that supports a spinning ball earth rotating around the sun. Please dont point to Isaiah 40:22 and tell me that proves a ball earth,it literally says circle. A circle isn't a ball. Satan rules the world right now (Luke 4:5-7) and we are in the age of deception. Pray for discernment and read your bible.

I heard the ridge was a result of a ring like Saturns collapsing after formation. 

Iapetus is the Roman name for Japheth.Japheth was the eldest son of Noah, and his sons were the first to be taught by God how to bury their dead, and the supposed progenitor of the Caucasians.Japheth was a Roman way of saying someone has Greek blood (i.e. a bloodline from time immemorial).

[Bright Insight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=335vSSTjWdI).  People claim to have seen lights coming from the moon.  Moon Express is launching a mining operation to the south pole of the moon.  Moon rocks from the moon contain unnatural (artificial) isotopes.  It goes on and on!

David Icke talks about this in his books and even mentions some of the work shown here. Starts around the 51:00 mark https://youtube.com/watch?v=VJorKZEbQsA

I was interested, but I couldn't handle the presenter.  I'm a little disappointed.

Interesting hypothesis.

Never heard this one.

Holy shit.  That was fucking amazing.  I was expecting some sort of stupid Hollow Earth calibre idea here, but that... kinda makes sense...

It's cool seeing hypothesis that go against the mainstream. It's less cool seeing hypothesis that argument against an imaginary theory, because the author do not understand the mainstream theory.He claims "mathematicians" claim that heavier elements formed in DISTANT random supernovaes. The actual idea is that they formed on the supernova that originated our system, using the atoms of a single supernova to build the current sun and planets.Just like arguments of the fake moon landing. It could be fake, but arguments like "you should see the stars!" are not helping the case at all.

The moon has incredibly irregular gravity, which makes having this orbit it quite difficult. So the grand plans of towing asteroids into orbit of the moon are much harder than people think. The gravity is irregular because of discrepancies in the density of different parts of the moon. There is quite a wealth of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. 

I love that you swing both ways ;-)So, if you mentioned Pink Floyd, is it a coincidence they were friends with Douglas Adams, creator of HHGTG?Now, that was a book that made my thought juices flow!

Why not though? The universe is ginormous and strange and rare things happen all the time. The moon was once closer to the earth and its getting farther away each year, meaning one day it won't appear the same size as the sun in the sky. We are just fortunate enough to be alive at this time to witness this.

Shower thought.. Moon is artificial Moon doesn't perfectly eclipse When did it? Answer this and we know how old the moon is. Why was a perfect eclipse necessary? Someone needed a window against the Sun's direct energy? Then again, night would solve that... Literally just crazy thoughts about something I've never really thought about 

Why wouldn't you see blue sky? You don't see it through the moon so much as you see the bright part of the moon reflecting sunlight through the blue sky.Having said that, it is interesting that the moon and sun appear almost the same size in the sky. 

> I was always curious as to why we could see the blue sky through the MoonYou don't see the blue sky through the Moon, you see the Moon through the blue sky.Imagine a crescent moon at night.  The dark side of it appears black, much like the space surrounding it.  Now imagine the same crescent moon during the day, the "dark" side appears blue, much like the space surrounding it.Also, if it were semi-transparent, then how do you explain Earthshine?

you can see the dark side of the moon during the day (or at night) with a telescope. its not transparent. the sky is blue and you see the bright moon through the sky not the blue sky through the moon.

> It is too a coincidence we never see the 'dark side of the Moon'It's the inevitable result of Earths gravitation influence. If you nudged the moon and made it spin a bit faster, it would eventually go back to how it is now. 

> The moon also has an atmosphere. Google it.Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.   >The moon is an artificial satellite. There is overwhelming evidence for this. There is not.

jesus... I wish there was enough funding to send all of the moon deniers or people who think it is a hologram or has an atmosphere, up to the moon so they can check it out themselves.Commercial spaceflight cant come soon enough...

Go on

Thank you for this. A very interesting read, like most of your posts and the links you share. Thanks for being a light in the darkness!

This is the round table.

Love this song.  

All the planets in our solar system. I'm sure in the billions of galaxies there are more that have this rare feature. Maybe not.

> Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun?Not that rare.  100% of the Earth's moons behave in this manner.

not just that it fits in there but that it fits in there while humans are on earth. a few million years ago and it was too close for a perfect fit in a few million years from now it will be too far away for a perfect fit. the fact that it is a perfect fit in the time when humans can use this to better observe the sun and space and it is all so damn perfect it is Ludacris. 

Okay, I read the link.. I get the basics in reference to the crates and whatnot, but what, exactly does this whole theory express? I don't want to buy the book.

That's cool I didn't know the thing about the moon meteorites.  Thanks

That's a very interesting thought

lol what? just what? the moon doesn't cool objects in its light. what? the sun and the moon are not the same thing. you can see them both in the same sky at the same time. what kind of primitive thinking are you using here?

Lunatics...  Interested in the moon!

You do relatise that Pluto has a moon, Charon, that's quite similar in size to Pluto itself? I know it's been desclasified as a planet, but it's a celestial object with another just as large as itself in orbit around each other.

Suggest it for the next one! Better yet, compile some info and make your own post! I think a more general "anomalous ancient sites" topic would be a great future round table. For example, [here's some stuff I found out about Puma Punku](https://www.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/1q912q/puma_punku_is_an_ancient_archaeological_site_in/), an amazing site in Bolivia.tbh, the civilizations associated with these sites and the origin of the moon might be more related that you might think (we're supposed to be going high octane, right?).After all, Aristotle wrote of an ancient people called the "Proselenes" who lived in Arcadia and who were said, by the very nature of their name, to have lived "before there was a moon in the sky".Some writers (ie the authors of Who Built the Moon?) think future humanity literally went back in time to put the moon there. 

I see 38 votes for moon anomalies, 5 for phobos anomalies, and 10 for hollow earth which easily puts this topic at #1.

Lemme elaborate on this since ive read about in on the internet, when you die your spirit, not your soul, releases its grip on the body, causing a release of heat, this heat will carry your spirit to the moon where the moon will absorb and digest it, your spirit will cease to exist, BUT, if you managed to develop a soul from the seed that is your spirit in your lifetime you will be able to choose wether to stay in our solar system within the ifluence of the sun as a soul, to feed the moon consciously, or to travel straight into the sun and become one with our creator, that is what ive read, yes what a crock of shit

Not exactly.

thats the craziest thing I've ever heard that gets thrown around a lot. Don't believe that nonsense, it's to instill fear.

The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory. If the moon was formed by material ejected from the earth in a collision, then that material would have come from the crust of the earth, not the earth's denser core.  The collision formation theories are most accepted, but vary from what objects collided with the earth to form the moon.  Seismometers placed on the moon in the 1970's, though, recorded the moon "ringing like a bell."  By this time we'd landed on the darn thing and still weren't convinced the moon was solid.  Of course, the argument can be made that a society sophisticated enough to craft a moon sized space station could sufficiently camouflage it to fool the primitives who live on the host planet.

I have heard the moon being translucent and stars being seen through the unlit half of the moon but never witnessed this or ever seen pictures/video of it. I imagine with all the eyes in the world looking up at the moon that we would have some pictures out there of stars in the dark side of the moon but they just don't exist. I have a telescope and can see the unlit half of the moon during the day. its always there and it has never appeared to be see through any time I have ever looked at it. 

>Whoever built the pyramids had a clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.That's not proof they understood the size of the Earth and Moon, just that they were able to produce a pyramid with a set of dimensions that squared the circle. The Earth and Moon do the same "coincidentally", but someone on Earth could figure out those proportions and admire their mathematical elegance *on their own* without ever looking up at the sky.

>Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always,Both of those statements are wrong. There are plenty of perfectly spherical moons in the solar systems, name just about any moon of a jovian planet and its likely to be spherical. Also, Pluto and Charon are tidally locked (which is the term for when a moon orbits at the same speed of its rotation so one side is constantly facing the planet) to one another. I think there are a few other cases of tidal locking in the solar system as well. 

Yeah...a satellite. Arabs before being Muslims were venerating the Moon...see 3/4 of muslim countries flags and coat of arms featuring quarter moons.So you're saying there was a a satellite of the moon in the 7th century?

Aliens, aliens gave humans that knowledge. Also possibly fallen angels enamored with human women. 

I realized that right after I made the post, thank you, it's 22/7.

Funny how some people put effort into finding patterns between numbers everywhere, yet don't put any effort into remembering (or even checking) for arguably the most know value of all, Pi. Says a lot about what their true aim is.Maybe if one would invest more time into understanding and less time into explaining, the world would be a better place.

>Whilst the eclipse conjoins his Ascendant/Mars conjunction, Saturn at 21.11 Sagittarius is exactly on his Moon at 21.12 Sagittarius. This eclipse, which so exactly replicates Trump’s chart, and which casts a shadow over the whole of the USA was a clear, unequivocal indication that he would win the 2016 election, but I don’t think any astrologer spotted it at the time.

You said it brother

It was Joe McMoneagle. Ingo Swann did write an amazing book (That you can find for free online as a pdf) called 'Penetration' In which he remote viewed the dark side of the moon. And what he found was amazing. He also talks about the strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water, ect.If you guys are interested in this stuff please check out my sub r/projectstargate I also have a video interview posted of McMoneagle talking about that "Trip" to mars.

The Mars/Jupiter papers are both great.  Page 6 of the Jupiter paper discusses solar & planetary fission... something I hadn't heard of outside of Van Flandern.  Thanks! 

Dun dun dun

Is that the prevailing theory in cosmology? Is it just the assumed natural evolution of the solar system?  i.e. What would happen if nothing dramatic occured astronomically to affect the earth's motion? Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?  Anyhow, it doesn't explain the biological clock.  

interesting thanks!

Length is gradually increasing over time, okay, but that ignores my suggestion that an astronomical event dramatically decreased it at some time in the past.

That's a lot of growth.  If that's your theory, where'd it come from?

that's flawed, the nuclear war he talks about apparently gouged out massive canyon's and is singlehandedly responsible for the fact mars is a desert wasteland now, hell it used to have oceans, to assume anyone beyond the very rare bunker or statue or temple, and i mean VERY rare, is absolutely absurd. Although i like the way you think. 

now this i can get behind. perhaps its a cloaking device that keeps amateur astronomers from seeing the cities and bases built there

>  maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirelyLike an alien observation station and its off limits for humans.

This is actually one of the better theories out there. Thank you for a very fresh alternative perspective.I do remember a certain researcher (God I forgot the name, I think he had some really long lectures on the Moon and Mars on Youtube) discuss how probes sent to the Moon hit a giant wall before coming to a halt. As if there were structures on the Moon. Built by aliens? Built by ancient humans? Current humans? Who knows, it is an interesting theory though.

interesting, it could also be waves caused by a change in temperature in the layer between moon and layers of atmosphere or there is a layer of water between us and the moon layer.

Great channel actually was watching some stuff on there before I found this thread.

If the equipment causes it, why does the 'wave' go out of frame in one video where he pans, then it reappears in the frame from the bottom edge without having changed speed or angle, exactly where it would have been if he hadn't panned? EDIT: [video here](https://youtu.be/XL5zuq5mtwc)I don't see how this clip is compatible with that redditor's explanation. The wave phenomenon seems to be totally decoupled from any equipment effects.

That's not an explination.  I've never heard about this stuff until today, but if you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM&app=desktop) about a third of the way through it he shows how the camera will pan and the wave will not pan with it, which clearly shows it's something external to the device. The only explination that makes any sense in light of that information is that it's atmospheric. 

Sure it is a good explanation but that doesn't mean that single comment discredits the entire thing, and what helps back my thought up is the comment below it blindly accepts it so quickly.  https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuegx9/

sorry but that's not the same effect. your example shows the entire image effected. like when you take a pic when your phone vibrates. the moon wave is completely different bc the entire photo doesnt vibrate. there is clearly a wave anomaly that is happening on the moon. the wave on moves across the surface. it pulses and is not constant as your effect describes. space above it not effected. its a sweeping wave that moves consistently across the surface and wraps the curvature of the moon. 

Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.

except its not a hot day on the moon.. ever..

Looks to me like it's only on the moon though..if it was an atmospheric phenomenon, you'd see that wave in the space around the moon too

You didn't look at the evidence.

ive looked and i cant find any scientific article even mentioning it.

>  and they simply bounced offThey bounced off because it wasn't water, it was brine and of a higher density and buoyancy than water.

It's the atmosphere, dude. Gas is fluidic, just observe the behavior of air above pavement on a hot day. That's why it all looks like lights under water *from an Earth-situated telescope* but not from any videos from in space (assuming you believe any of them are real).

> essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project.You are referring to Gnosticism. Where God is real, and the universe was created, but not by God but a kind of "malevolent force" with the hopes of separating consciousness and hiding from consciousness it's beginning/true power. This is the ancient religion that the Matrix movies are based around. > I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lotLiterally impossible as red/blue shifting wouldn't be a thing and at a certain distance away from us stars would just not be visible (like just about any source of light not in our solar system).

well space isn't a true vacuum anyways, it has material that floats around. though if applying the holofractal theory, space is considered a type of matter

[deleted]

I want to find that video of the water in watet. I remember seeing years ago. The water had a current and waves. It was so wierd. I don't recall the part where they bounced off it though. It was some time ago.

I think if this was proven to not be atmosphere (as it's definitely not equipment related) then it would serve as proof that we're living in a simulated reality.

Don't you dare fucking bring god into this, that ruins any shred of credibility.

Or an illusion caused by temperature change, shifting air masses, water vapor or any host of atmospheric event- especially if the waves move from the bottom upward? 

Thanks!

Yes. This is the same reason stars twinkle.

search youtube for moon wave, there are plenty of other examples.  It's really weird, looks like a video that's refreshing

[deleted]

I think you're taking that a good ways out of context. Since they're talking about seismic activity it reads as if he's referring to long, continued vibrations and shaking. Something like a handbell or even the vibrations felt after striking a bell. That doesn't necessarily mean it's hollow, just that he was describing the very long time frames of the tremors. 

Ok so if we're dreaming, what and where are our real bodies that are currently sleeping? 

> glitchAny video of this?

I can't stand this as a flat earth argument. 

Argument for a locality. These kind of pics cast doubt on their actual distance... This is part of how I startd to wonder if things are different than our education teaches us.

That's not right

Are we, like...the chosen ones?

Thought to be fair, just because something has low odds of occurring doesn't mean it can't occur. 

*Never tell me the odds!**That's no moon!*Star Wars overload!

The moon used to be closer to the Earth though. It's moving away from us at consistent pace. 

This.

This kind of stuff more or less cherrypicks in various ways, between which celestial bodies are being compared, the grounds for comparison, and the relationships being found.  For every one "Woah" relationship found, a hundred duds were thrown out.If you examine everything for all conceivable relationships, the biggest coincidence would be finding no coincidences.

Evolution doesn't happen by chance. Evolution is the result of natural selection. For your comparison to be true, there would had to have been many different shaped and sized moons orbiting Earth, yet now only one remains due to its specific shape and size.

All this comment means is that you don't, or don't want to, understand evolution. 

I think it's pretty likely. The variety of breeds humans have been able to produce just by selective breeding kind of shows how we can make animals change to have certain traits. Now just do that but for millions of years and eventually the DNA will be so far apart that breeds won't be able to produce viable offspring anymore. 

So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat.  So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members?  Clearly all of this is created either way.  Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.  I mean the flat earth has to be at the most likely to not exist out of 100's.  I doubt 10% on /conspiracy believe it's flat.  There's just so much evidence from pictures of the Earth from space.  I don't think any of it has to do with religion.  The Roman Catholics did get very corrupt just after a few hundred years though so I wouldn't put it past them to lie to scare people into giving money.

I have the same attitude towards the flat earth theory as you do. If it were flat, I don't think it just be so NASA can rack in cash. I believe it would be hundreds of years before NASA was even born, that the deception would have started. But then we have People like Newton who would also have to be a lie.Too me, as a guy who's only watched like 20 mins about it, maybe the earth is simply bigger then what they tell us?  Apparently NASA means to deceive in Hebrew. Huge if true.

I read the Bible 3 times a year cover to cover brother.  I've only seen support for a round earth over and over and over in the Bible.

There's nothing in the bible that supports airplanes either, but I rode in one just the other day.

Even [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_ridge_on_Iapetus) for the equatorial ridge is pretty explicit:>It is not clear how the ridge formed. One difficulty is to explain why it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are at least four current hypotheses, but none of them explains why the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio.It's easily one of the most incredible unexplained things we've discovered in our solar system.The ring "Chicken Little" theory [was suggested by](https://gizadeathstar.com/2014/04/can-relax-now-mysterious-equatorial-ridge-iapetus-finally-explained/) *Discover* Magazine:>The *Discover* article points out that the theory has not yet been "peer reviewed", but there it is. We're being asked to believe on the basis of a computer-claptrap model that the ridge "fell from the sky" after "rings" were formed around the planet, rings which were unstable, and which fell into the surface of the planet.>Uh huh. What about those three parallel grooves? Were there three neatly parallel ring unstable ring systems?There's actually *another* theory that "Iapetus may have possessed its own moon that became tidally shredded to create a ring system that eventually fell to the moon's surface.">OK...a moon with a moon which became tidally shredded to form a neat ring, which was unstable, which then fell to Iapetus' surface and formed that neat equatorial ridge. And, presumably, became shredded in such a way to form three closely bunched parallel rings in three planes which were all unstable and then fell to the planetary surface?>Would Iapetus have had sufficient force to be able to shred its own moon? Can we see what the possible mass of that moon may have been? Would it have been enough to create the equatorial ridge?"But whatever the source, it seems scientists are agreeing that Iapetus couldn't have created the mountain range without some help from up above.">I don't know about you, but that strikes me as yet another tongue in cheek remark. "Help from above?" Help implies helpers. Helpers implies intelligence. Intelligence implies...>...on yea, we can't go there. The ridge has been "explained." Perfectly natural. >Nothing to see here...move along, it fell from the sky after a moon was tidally shredded to form an unstable ring system which collapsed and fell on poor Iapetus....

You are right, he definitely has a chip on his shoulder. He is brilliant, however. He is responsible for smuggling Pentium computer chip tech to the Soviets early nineties...

I think this one is from the Stellar Metamorphosis theory. Basically, the universe is a lot older than 13.8 billion years... possibly eternal. And all planets are formed from the eroded leftovers of stars.According this this theory, the sun would be the youngest object in our solar system. Jupiter would be a fair bit older. Earth would be a lot older and Mercury is absolutely ancient.

That other physicist that people post here theorized that everything is a black hole and all we see are the event horizons 

Thanks for commenting!

Orbiting the moon is certainly impractical. For parking asteroids for mining purposes, the earth-moon lagrange points L4 and L5 would make a lot more sense, though I'm not sure how viable"landing" something the size of substantial asteroid into those points would be; on-site extraction might just be more practical than moving the entire asteroids.

Why don't planets stop spinning then, as they are like moons to the sun?Do other planets moons not rotate?Edit: Found this cool article: http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/44-our-solar-system/the-moon/general-questions/110-does-the-moon-rotate-are-there-other-moons-that-always-keep-one-face-toward-their-planet-intermediate, which provides info towards my second question.  Interesting stuff

>Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.What is you PhD in? Where do you base this on? When accredited scientists have proven otherwise.> There is not.Edited:Prove to me that the moon is a natural satellite. I can, and will debunk this. History books on the moon are, and have been re written. New evidence trumps old theories.

What about the 3 Apallo spacecraft that were fuelled, and ready to bring men back to the moon, that were left to rust. We have the money to go back. We already spent some. But TPTB refuse to. Why is that? You said "If only there was funding." Like our fiat monetary system couldnt establish that. We dont go back to the moon for a very exact reason.

Our grandchildren will laugh at our presumptions the same way we laugh at our grandfathers.

I can elaborate on this. The moon's distance and size relative to the earth is almost too coincidental to be naturally occurring. There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. There are records in some extremely ancient cultures of certain peoples being around 'before the moon'. There is no theory for the formation of the moon that makes sense, the impact theory is something championed by most people but they don't read the next paragraph of that theory which states that an almost equal impact would have been necessary directly after to correct course and spin. The is a very compelling case that the moon isn't naturally occurring. If you're interested read a book called 'Who built the moon' by Christopher Knight. Very interesting, although their conclusions leave something to be desired. The theory that it was flown here has risen from a combination of these different anomalies. It would make sense to place a large body like the moon around a planet a species was interested in interacting with, sort of like hiding in plain sight. The notion that the moon isnt naturally occurring gives credence to this. Of course it's just a theory, there is no conclusive proof it is a type of space ship. But then again, if there was conclusive proof this topic wouldn't be in the conspiracy subreddit ;).  

hahah like really go on. 

Sweet. I'll be checking in on this one. I hope it's a hallowed out space ship. That's crazy cool.

[Exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB2Ad04mukI)

Well at least you understood my small effort to inject a little humour. The original meaning of "lunatic" actually meant being under the spell of the Moon or "Luna" which is it's ancient name, like the ancient one for the Sun which is "Sol" from which we get solar, solstice, etc.The French word for the moon still is "la Lune" and there were of course people in ancient times who worshipped the Moon and "Diana" who was the goddess of the Moon and was believed to live on the Moon and they used to dance and frolic under the light of the full Moon in their outdoor ceremonies dedicated to her. And then there's the whole business about moonlight being romantic and people falling in love in the moonlight.And the Moon is very strange and mysterious and we really don't know very much about it and a whole lot of people really are utterly fascinated by the whole business... almost to the point of being under a spell by it.But there can't be any of those "lunatics", here, now can there? Or maybe I should have said "moon-atics"? 

The astronomers no longer consider Pluto to be a planet for a number of valid reasons and it's difficult to say what either Pluto and Charon actually are at this point. If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the two and they both actually orbit around a point in space *between them* that actually traces their path around the Sun. It's unusual because that point between them is closer to Pluto giving Charon an outer orbit around that point and Pluto taking an inner orbit around it on the opposite side of it as if they were rigidly connected through that point in their motions. So it isn't any typical planet/moon arrangement but two bodies orbiting an invisible point as if they were both moons going around it. Their tumbling orbit around the Sun as they wheel around it together is also highly unusual and brings them even closer to the Sun than Neptune is throughout parts of it probably because they weren't created by or with our system but rather captured and pulled into that off-kilter orbit after being cast-off from another system beyond ours.

was it the Alex jones and David Ich one?

That's no moon...

> The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory.How?  If it were hollow, how could it have a density of 3.34 g/cm^3 ?> If the moon was formed by material ejected from the earth in a collision, then that material would have come from the crust of the earth, not the earth's denser core. The collision formation theories are most accepted, but vary from what objects collided with the earth to form the moon.Okay?> Seismometers placed on the moon in the 1970's, though, recorded the moon "ringing like a bell."By this time we'd landed on the darn thing and still weren't convinced the moon was solid.The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moisture.  Not because the moon is hollow.> Of course, the argument can be made that a society sophisticated enough to craft a moon sized space station could sufficiently camouflage it to fool the primitives who live on the host planet.Certainly, but that could be said about literally anything around us.

Yeah. I've heard the distance increases the rate of recession, so it's 4cm/year now, but a million years from now it could be 1km/year (just making up numbers to explain)But yes right now the sun and moon share the same apparent diameter. In the distant future that won't be the case anymore, making total solar eclipses impossible.

is there any fucking thread I can read on this website which doesn't descend into an anti-trump circlejerk? Even turning astrophysics into some American political shitfest 

What do you mean by>strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water,

>  Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?Yes, [we've measured it decreasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) 

Not really _my_ theory, just a thought I love to entertain, simply for the beauty of it (the continent coasts don't only fit where the Atlantic is, but also where the pacific is). "[Expanding Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanding_Earth)" gives nice search results on YouTube, and it seems to overlap here and there with "Electric Universe"/"Plasma Universe" approaches to cosmology. Interesting trivia: it _precedes_ Wegeners plate tectonics theory by almost a century :)

I've found the moon rabbit hole is deep and one of the most disturbing, because dealing with the implications of all the strangeness, coincidences, and anomalies having to do with the moon is so far-reaching it can shake the foundations of everything you think you know.Crrow777, the man who captured the first video of the lunar wave, has a good Youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Crrow777) if you want to dive in.  You can search for "moon" in his videos, but he delves into a lot more.  This guy will have you questioning everything.

You are thinking of Phobos, a moon of Mars.The Soviets sent 22 probes, none sent back useful info - one is even rumoured to have filmed a rocket leave the surface and impact the Soviet's probe.

There's a great video of (amateur?) rocket equipped with outer camera going from surface of the earth to zero gravity. It's almost as if it hits the water. Google it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26sby2/hologram_visual_wave_covering_the_moon/chuhvh7/that's also explained. > He rotated the camera with respect to the 'field' and corrected the image with editing software or a field rotation prism in the telescope>You are probably right on and in one of his videos he says he done exactly as you say, rotating the camera then turning the image back right with editing software.

Because it is fraud by Crow77. Make your own observations and you will never see one.

Or Fraud.  That would explain it.  It would also explain why no one else has observed.

He's saying that since the camera is on earth (and in Florida in this particular video), the heat in earth's atmosphere may cause a visible ripple. 

no the moon but OUR atmosphere here on Earth. we are looking through it to the moon which distorts its image slightly. thats my take on it. Not that the moon is hot

That's assuming the wave covers the entire length of the cameras POV, which translates to thousands of miles. Stars twinkle all the time precisely because of these atmospheric waves, but they don't twinkle in unison because these shifting densities are smaller in scale than that.

No, we wouldnt expect to see it on the dark area around the moon -- there is no light from there reaching our eyes. 

I watched the video.  What evidence do you mean?

I don't believe anything anymore 

Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.

What's the holofractal theory? I try visit that sub but can't understand anything posted there 

Near vacuum.

Search for 'Underwater brine pools'.

It's so hard to find the real video with the researchers talking about it, it was intentionally deleted I believe by the BBC and they were able to have youtube delete basically all the uploads. That's one of those things where you have to wonder what is so damaging about that account from a scientist that they went to that much effort to erase it entirely. Much like antarctica, there is much hidden about the deep ocean for unknown reasons, very little is allowed to be released to the public. 

[Is this it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZD2STt_OU)

perhaps, but what intrigues me is why the wave seems to follow the curvature of the moon rather than just traveling over 

It is fraud, plain and simple.

you win the award for the worlds most ignorant response 

It doesn't do that through a telescope.  I've tried many times.  I don't know if it's the atmosphere or the video camera but it isn't the moon.  I know that for sure.  It's real and round 100%.  I know this is /conspiracy but I have a lot of friends with big telescopes.  

[deleted]

Sweet!  I do that too!  I just need a better camera to mount on my lens.  Right now it's decent but maybe half the quality as these vids.  It's really cool to have a telescope with GPS hooked up to a camera recording on your laptop. 

way to take what they said out of context. seismic activity needs shifting plates. considering NASA previous statements about the moon, I think "rang like a bell" has a literal connotation. 

Hmm, let me try to be as clear as possible. The body you are in now is actually a physical projection from a different state, ..though it's not so much a state as it is a different area of our consciousness.  The only difference between your waking and dreaming self is that while waking we separate from that area of dreaming. And in doing so project a dream reality apart from it. The key to understanding our planets and moons and space in general is that it is a reflection of our focus. As we are projecting into this dream we agree on a focus. A template. A model. And this 'entering into' as a focus here, during that entering the focus adopts the model and projects it as a reality. So when most think of planets having an effect on us, or that they were the results of God's or scientific Theories... that is the complete opposite of what is actually happening. The human consciousness is reflecting itself as a layered reality.  Dense physical waking self in one area, and then light astral body dreaming self, or space, as another layer of consciousness.

Many. Go up in the thread I'm on mobile

Well, we and the people a couple thousand years before and after us...?

Only as far as solar eclipses are concerned. 

Yes, this is pretty similar to theists saying that the low odds of our planet being in the goldilocks zone is proof of a designer. 

A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

Perhaps even evolution isn't happening by chance. It could be that all of reality, including all of nature is communicating with itself on a quantum level in closed systems - thus creating grounds for an intelligent evolution, with intelligent mutations, not entirely random ones. One where "Intelligent design" isn't done by a Deity, but by nature itself.This is supported by the /r/holofractal theory of the Universe (not yet validated by mainstream science and probably missing some parts and connections to make it so, but I do feel it is a step in the right direction).

I do understand evolution.  Be honest, the odds of life evolving on this planet or anywhere else in the universe are just as improbable as the uniqueness of our planet's moon.  Improbable but not impossible.  You should learn to appreciate that.  

>So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat. So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members? Clearly all of this is created either way. Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.That isn't my understanding. My impression from speaking with flat-earthers is that the bible says the earth is circular, but not "round" in the way you mean it. They all believe that the bible strongly implies that the earth is flat and round (circular). They believe that the push towards thinking the earth is a globe and could have formed naturally is specifically to make people believe that a god isn't required for the earth to exist, while a flat earth could not form naturally and is proof of gods design.Not that there aren't flat-earthers who aren't religious, but that's really been the only motive I've heard for this supposedly huge cover-up

Im a skeptic but I had fun going down this rabbit hole for a bit. I like to read about oddities in space but I dont seek them out much. The wall is certainly interesting 

Corporate espionage?

If that's true then what is Cosmic Background Radiation? 

So I've thought about this some and I have an admittedly probably stupid idea.  Mainstream physics: the edge of the universe is similar to an event horizon, and the schwarzschild radius of something with the mass of the estimated mass of the universe would be about the radius of the observable universemy madness: we are inside a black hole, collapsing.  The reason we see an expanding universe is simply that we perceive time as the direction where entropy increases.  It's arbitrary whether we are collapsing or expanding.

It's possible.

Absolutely.  I'm 35 and I'm already becoming a grumpy old man :D

I love moon mythology. I remember reading this YouTube transcription of Stichens Sumerian tablets, and how the Anunnaki were always enamoured by our moon. Perhaps they were amazed because they knew it was fake but they themselves didn't build it? Whoa dude.  Aliens upon aliens! That said, let's be scientific. If the moon IS FAKE, how can we test and prove it? Is it falsifiable? If we trace time back, can we figure out when the move actually arrived? I posted a thought earlier to wondering when our lunar eclipse used to PERFECTLY eclipse the sun? Is there something interesting about that date? If it was designed to perfectly eclipse, why? What technological advantage would that present? Perhaps it needs constant reorbiting to keep it in the perfect eclipse range but after its creators/operators left, it has been spiralling outwards ever since?  HOLY fucking shit... https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-solar-eclipse-coincidence/The last paragraph seems to indicate that TREX would have seen a full eclipse..... 50 million years from now we won't have total eclipses anymore.. Therefore it happened around 50 or 60 say million years ago.. Did the moon kill the dinosaurs? Yeah, lock me up I've officially gone insane lol

Spoiler Alert: It is ;)

> If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the twoYou are mistaken. >they both actually orbit around a point in space between themThat's because Charon is such a large moon, that it's fucking with Plutos position. 

> The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moistureYou seem pretty certain of that, would you mind explaining where you get that from? Because the moon ringing is established fact. The composition would be based on a handful of moon rocks brought back. One seems far more reliable than the other. Don't take this as a personal attack but it sounds like you aren't willing to entertain the idea the moon is hollow despite compelling evidence that it is. Edit: You did post where you got that from, my mistake for not reading further down. However I read your pdf article. When we theorize the moon is hollow I think you misinterpret what we mean by hollow. It still has something it it's core, the mass in between the surface and the core is evidenced to be either hollow or honeycombed. There is still a core if course because there is still a magnetic field. In fact none of the sources you posted provide a reliable theory for the composition of the moon. That's because there isn't one. The conclusion of the article assumes the impact formation theory, which is in no way reliable or certain. In fact you might be interested to know that the only way the impact theory for the formation of the moon can be correct is if there was a second almost identical impact afterwards. Science based on assumptions is just that. Again, don't take this as a personal attack, it's not. But throwing shade around like;> but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollowWhen your conclusions are based on assumed theories you can't be certain of them. The attitude you are taking is kind of the opposite of the scientific process which you seem to champion so strongly.

Dude, I am not a physicist.  I got that from Wikipedia.  After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center.  But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density.  Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth.  Doesn't make it hollow.  Makes it less dense.  I'm not arguing the moon is hollow.  I'm just sharing information about the theory.

> original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetA) how the hell would you know the original height to such a specific degree andB) I find no source saying it was that height, it just seems to be convenient to your next equation rather than a representation that's accurate.

Also love the how the pyramid is accurate to 4 decimal places but you're happy to use 432,000 instead of 432287.938 which is the Suns actual radius in miles and good to let slide errors in measuring the polar radius.  Could that be because none of your magic maths would work otherwise?

Fun fact / Maybe we're going too far : the A note used to be 432 hertz before we set it up to 440 relatively recently

I have a pretty damn good telescope, and I can tell you for a fact there is not 'greenery' on the moon.

Those are indeed strange facts. Since most think the moon is a dead/natural satellite.But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. But you see them crop through the news now and again as they are "rediscovered"

I love the idea of flipping everything we know around, because all I feel they need is hidden tech, and they can tell all the lies they want. I know it's not healthy to always think the world is against you, but it helps when you remember it's all of us regular (if you don't want me grouped with you that's cool) people against the ambiguous "them".But I take breaks here and there and enjoy time with friends to solidify myself here and not lose grip.Strange times ahead for sure. 

Not gonna lie this is kind of unnerving 

Crow is a fraud that manufactured those "waves."

Phobos is little more than very large rock. It's about the length of Manhattan. Gravity is near enough to nil that anything living on it would be better off just living in zero-g. 

There are many good leads but this is probably not one of them.  Look up how they "de-spin" rockets which normally spin in order to maintain some orientation.  Absolute linear speed changes are not going to be easy detect with no reference frame.

I'm unconvinced.How does field rotation correlate with a phenomenon that appears to track across the visible moon both before and after the field of view pans?If you feel field rotation is enough then perhaps you can break down how it caused the specific observed effect even after the pan, addressing each of these points:1. The telescope captures a "wave" apparently between the moon and the telescope lens propagating at a constant speed and direction.2. The telescope is panned such that the "wave" is out of the visible frame.3. The "wave" catches up with the visible frame, re-entering from the bottom edge where we would expect it to be if the camera had not panned, and then continues at the same constant speed and direction until reaching the top edge of the moon.

I thought a chap in Germany had independently verified his observation?This is a relatively new phenomenon. I'm open-minded about waiting for more evidence. I'm not saying it's real, but to say outright that it's a fraud is a conclusion without evidence too.

Following Occam's razor, it's much more likely to be atmospheric.

> Not that the moon is hotthe temperature on the surface of the moon hit by the sun can reach over 250°F

Believe in things that can produce results. I 'believe' in many aspects of science because they produce direct, observable results. As for the moon being a hologram? Makes no sense, how could we predict tides if the moon didn't have mass. Moon bases and moon settlements/cities? I doubt it just like everything else. Extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence, etc. but I don't dismiss it, because I have no way to know one way or the other. 

Either this guy is close to the 'source' or a mad man. Either way, massive respect.

consider things as probability/possibility. belief is a tough one. you can have faith in a thing. apply the sceintific method to a thing. things are harsh. learn as much as you can. it always pays off. 

But believing that you don't believe is itself a belief.

Seems like the safest route for now.

This is hardly meant to be a conclusive argument, but the reason the waves appear chaotic above asphalt is the proximity of high heat makes a lot of displacement waves in the air, which collide into the chaos we're used to seeing. At higher altitudes, few waves would be generated and are less likely to collide, so it's possible to see it keep a consistent angle and velocity.Source: B.S. in physics and a lot of recent experience with wave/sound mechanics

Have these things been seen with the human eye or is it just something that happens if you zoom a digital camera at the moon long enough ?

It *doesn't* follow the curvature. It's more pronounced on the vertical side of the moon and by the time it gets to the top horizontal line it's imperceptible , and *doesn't* come back down the other side. That's exactly what I'd expect if a ripple was moving from down to up in the atmosphere between the observer and the moon.

the entire "sky" is fake. there is no "outer space" in this simulation.

well said. 

So who or what are other people? If their real, why doesn't their dream focus affect my dream too? 

[deleted]

How is that? Firstly, the odds aren't really that low, and secondly, that would mean that even if it is low, it's still probable without a creator. 

If a higher dimension entity isn't a designer that how is this being created, by our own minds?  Lol I wonder if Mario and Luigi are atheists. 

Eh that's different though since life should only likely observe itself to be in a place that is suitable for life to be. So like, while our planet is certainly extremely rare it should be extremely common that any life that exists exists in the rare suitable places for it.The eclipse lining up at the same time humans start recording history has no obvious necessity.

The usual argument for this is like the anthropic principle.  The planets where it didn't happen there is no one to complain about it, the odds of us being on a planet where we evolved are 100%.  The moon isn't like that.  Some aspects of it might be, such as stablizing the axis of rotation and the climate stablity that comes with that.  The convenient eclipse size is just fun though.  It's proportionally much larger than moons around other planets.  And it's not a uniform density either, attempts to orbit probes very closet to the surface failed due to anomalies in the gravitational field much larger than anywhere on earth.  I don't know about the "moon wave" thing, this is the first time I saw that.

as a christian, that sounds absolutely ridiculous. you might as well say the Earth is actually a square as "proof" of intelligent design

I don't mean a perfect circle.  I need to check that thread on how many people do believe the Earth is flat.We can go to the "edge" if that's the case ourselves.  No one is guarding the entire edgle.  It's just 1000's of years this conspiracy has gone on with no one messing up.  We go into space and take pictures of the moon, and from satellites.  I hope we all know even if we didn't go to the moon we were in space near it.  I think they walked on the moon.

No, the Bible supports a round Earth that isn't at the center of the Universe.  I can get the scripture.  I just went through a lesson on this.

I wanted to look into this more as I e never heard of it and I found this. https://www.google.com/amp/s/archyfantasies.com/2012/04/02/the-10-most-not-so-puzzling-ancient-artifacts-the-grooved-spheres/amp/I seems those rocks are still really cool, but not all that mysterious. 

Yup! Several folks have drawn comparisons between Iapetus and the Transvaal spheres.

There are strange hexagonal shapes on the surface of Iapetus as well.

Makes sense to me 

anything is possible

it has been, mainstream science has blacklisted alien/religious theorist's and tons of these theorists have said this, any evidence they find is usually laughed off, and often only published on websites like this or personal websites, and if you ask most informed people, which I've done, and probably shouldn't have because it's done wonders for my reputation i'm sure, they'll tell you how obvious it is that most mainstream scientists won't even humor alternative science, only doing so when it gets popular. 

The Moon is a pretty deep rabbit hole :). And it leds you down the path of realising that we know almost nothing about cosmology, and that most of our theories on it are at odds with new data almost on a monthly basis. Personally I'm convinced the Moon isn't real in the sense it is an organicly occurring satellite, I believe it was very much put there, by whom I can't be sure. A shower thought I had the other day was that if there is a malignant alien presence exerting an influence over our species, and IF there is a galactic council or something similar trying to do something about it, it would make sense that the Moon being the craft the malignant aliens came here on would give them some sort of insurance against the tampering of their affairs but other species. "Hey you, stop messing with the humans and leave their world!", "Sure bro, we'll just take the Moon with us", "But that would be catastrophic!" "Then I guess stay out of our business."Not saying that's what I believe, just a thought I had ;).

*You may fire when ready.*

> You seem pretty certain of that, would you mind explaining where you get that from? Because the moon ringing is established fact. The composition would be based on a handful of moon rocks brought back. One seems far more reliable than the other. Don't take this as a personal attack but it sounds like you aren't willing to entertain the idea the moon is hollow despite compelling evidence that it is.The moon ringing is actually proof that it isn't hollow:https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/15mar_moonquakes.htmlhttp://www.popsci.com/does-moon-sound-like-bell

It's possible that all planets are hollow.Check out the book Hollow Planets by Jan Lamprecht, it's pretty stunning actually.

> After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center.Here is a more scientific analysis of what the moon is made of (pdf warning):http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/people/seth/351/lunarcore.2011.pdfnon-pdf: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/281/5382/1476.full> But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density. Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth.There is a good quora article about it, but keep in mind that primary sources are far better, but less accessible:https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Moon-less-dense-than-the-Earth> Doesn't make it hollow. Makes it less dense. I'm not arguing the moon is hollow. I'm just sharing information about the theory.Fair enough, but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollow.

This is a sadly underrated critique. 

no they used cubits

the distance of 1 KM is still the same amount of distance if measured in Miles, but the numbers are different because each unit of measurement is in comparison to a control. Every measurement is just measuring the variance from the original control object. 

Upvoted for the kooky dooky 

But not the other half of the moon.

>>But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. Any sources? Proven facts are documented.

um, can you show me any of those 4 things?

Did the 10 other people who caught them manufacture the exact same thing also?

Millions of astronomers over thousands of years and the first dude to observe this is a flat earther?Gimme a break. Obvious fraud.

Crow's videos were shared with the fine people studying atmospheric optics over at /r/atoptics and opinion was that the video was fraud or possibly a contrail.  No one else observes this phenomenon.https://www.reddit.com/r/atoptics/comments/4nxmwl/can_anyone_help_identify_what_is_causing_this/

true, i don't even really believe that

Yep.

if it were an artifact of digital recording the wave would likely move or change in state if the camera panned.  If you look at the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM&app=desktop) he shows footage of the wave not moving with the camera as he pans quickly, and follows it's original trajectory as if unaffected by the camera itself.

Good point

Why do you insist on misquoting me?  LOL.  Conspiratards will tell any lie to support their delusions. 

I need to get a USB camera.  Mine hooks up to my laptop and I can get it on my screen.  I'll definitely record hours of footage.  I looked for aliens for years and all I've ever seen is satellites.  On my space forum 1000's of people who are experts (with telescopes, ones 30 feet tall some have built) all say they have never seen anything weird about the moon, any planet, or seen any UFO's.  

apparently people have only captured 11 waves so far on footage. and some occur near equinoxes or during lunar eclipses

It does. We all ripple out. Everything we do or believe , our thoughts, mental energy travels invisibly all around us, and we are in a sense biological antennae receiving it, and projecting it. Collectively we agree on what objects and forms will hold all the energy constantly overflowing from each person in this reality. The Sun is powered by us ,by our energy.  The moon itself is a symbol of night, of dreams.  we all agree on what we dream together, and the forms this will take.

Other people are their own consciousness. You or I are individual. You talking to me is your creation. Me talking to you is my creation. We each create our reality, but we cooperate. Just like we are doing. Only we also cooperate in ways we take for granted. Like we agree to agree there is a sun over our head and a moon trailing behind it. It's automatic, the stuff we take for granted is an automatic agreement. 

[deleted]

I don't think it's a valid argument, I was making the comparison to say that I don't think astronomical coincidences (size and position of Earth, of the moon and so on) are very meaningful. It's like a lottery in which each ticket has an equal and vanishingly small chance of winning but there must be a winner. Given that we have a moon it has to be one distance from the earth or another. Seeing its current position as somehow too "perfect" to be accidental is a very human-centric position. 

A common thought is that Antarctica is actually a seawall all around the flat earth that is a circle shape.  This would explain the reason why all countries have forbidden Antarctic exploration on a mass scale. Then a dome, "the firmament", encloses our atmosphere.  The firmament is in Genesis. 

nobody goes to space, all photos and videos are fake

Link please.

Kinda hexagonal shaped. And there are other shapes that look like they could have been buildings. But this sounds like a very harsh environment, to harsh for life to exist. The spaceship theory was fun too, but I think we know enough about the make up of Ipateus to know that's not very likely either. But Im open for discussion, whats your theory if you think these were built? Why? or what purpose do they serve? 

That's nonsense and you know it. 

I second this.  I watched a presentation of his a few years back, thinking that it'd just be some more hollow earth ridiculousness.  I did not expect to be convinced, but it was solid, well reasoned, and not full of the esoteric imaginative gibberish that most hollow earth stuff has.

I'm reading this after I finish my current book, pretty excited for it haha

"but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollow."Thought we were discussing "theories" here?   In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory.  Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief.  I know what the moon is made of.  I can Google scientific papers all day long.  That's not what I want to do.  I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories.  But no.  You come in here all Logical and link all your "peer reviewed" research from accredited publications.  Great.  Thanks.  You've ruined this for me.  

They used cubits and other things I can't remember the names of... furlongs? Idk, but the thing is, the units weren't standardized; like a master mason might have his set of measuring sticks passed down from his father who he apprenticed under, and maybe even his grandfather etc, but his would be slightly different than another masons tools although they would both measure a cubit. It wouldn't really matter, as long as they stick with one per structure so it has standardized units of measurement throughout; it would be a pain in the ass to renovate a building you didn't originally build though... Anyways, my point is that it would be damn near impossible to align structures to true north or whatever down to the last micrometer like people insinuate when they talk about these things when everyone is essentially using a unique measurement unit, I'd assume that they're pretty damn close but not perfect.

So you think there are green (read about chlorophyll) plants on the *dark side* of the moon?  You understand why that wouldn't make sense, right?

No, because there arent ten other people.Thousands of years of Astronomy and one dude observes this phenomenon and no one else? Lol

It doesn't matter what he believes. The video evidence stands on its own, until it is properly debunked. His personal views don't change the footage, and trying to discredit that evidence just because you disagree with him on other things is pretty closed minded.

Ah interesting, I thought you meant fraud as in the moon is a fraud.  He claims some of the videos are from other people but who knows if that's true

its word for word what you said bro you were commenting this on that conspiracy subreddit 

Sad, wonder why there used to be so much activity and now almost nothing. There are some theories saying they camouflage themselves somehow, need IR camera and stuff like that.But I suppose who knows at this point, you could make a bunch of theories up from that, maybe they're grouping up somewhere, preparing?Wishful thinking I know, besides we have those who believe they are demons. 

I fully understand what the terminology means. The Matrix is way over populated. It is also not mega advanced tech wise. Some people who have a NDE can clearly see the "White Light" at death is completely staged and somewhat synthetic and even crappy. People all over the world have been experiencing "Glitches In The Matrix". From identical people, cars, locations and objects completely respawning, to the projection actually freezing and the characters and objects around them staying in place for numerous seconds.

It's a bit tautological too. If it wasn't "perfect" (e.g. close enough to evolve life that can get intelligent), we wouldn't be here to realize it. 

But how is it too perfect? Why would it being seemingly the same size as the sun in our sky bare any real significance? What does the fact that solar eclipses happen sometimes actually change in our lives, other than a few moments to go "oooo". The moon could be a different size or distance and tides would still happen, which is a much more significant phenomena to aid the growth and spread of life than eclipses. 

if i thought it was nonsense, i wouldn't have said it, and if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want but mainstream everything, from politics to science is constantly caught cheating, lying, stealing, and blackmailing as well as blacklisting things they don't like, only people who don't like the truth blindly believe they don't exclude narratives  they don't like. 

yeah, i researched hollow theory quite a bit and did a presentation on it for my chemistry class for a pseudoscience assignment. it actually stirred my curiosity on to look into other "conspiracies." my conclusion is that until we have the technology to dig past our crust, we'd have to rely on assumptions given through how the seismic data is interpreated

You've ruined this for me.Good, people need to spread actual knowledge rather than nonsense, otherwise we'll keep coming closer to a modern version of the Dark Ages ...

[Holy moly.  It's  not literally dark, dude.  It's tidally locked & we only ever see one side.  The moon has days and nights, just like us.](http://earthsky.org/space/five-myths-about-the-moon)  #5

I don't think so, but no one from earth's perspective ever sees the dark side of the moon.

Uh I'm reading the book and so far all I can find is that he's citing other books, namely  Jessup, Morris K. (1957). The Expanding Case for the UFO. New York: Citadel PressandStrange World of the Moon - 1962 (by VA Firsoff)Neither of these are in print.Swann refers to Firsoff as a top scientist and authority on the moon. This seems to a be a pretty strong embellishment based on what can be found about the man.MK Jessup is a better known ufologist who was at one point a PhD candidate but it's not clear that he ever finished his degree or worked in science in any capacity after that point.I'd say this is a pretty weak source overall.

Try thinking.  Maybe the wave wasn't there thousands of years ago.  Maybe they didn't have high def cameras.Try checking before making a blatantly false statement.  This video shows 10 wave captures by people around the world.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGxysKSGEM

Do you really think that after thousands of years of observations only Crow77 has ever observed this phenomenon?Do you simply believe every video you see, even when that video contradicts the personal observation of BILLIONS of humans over thousands of years?Dude, think. Obviously fraud. 

It isnt true.  No one else observes this phenomenon. 

Word for word?  Read it again if you can actually read, which is doubtful. 

I'm highly confident the "aliens" are fallen angels/demons.  I've had a lot of contact with them since age 14 when it started.  I brought a demon back from Peru and it will tell me it's name if I ask.  It possessed me and I started stabbing myself with the Peruvian knife (turns out it's the Peruvian God of war carved on the knife and they pray over it).

/r/glitch_in_the_matrix

its a bit far-reaching for me, but there are footage of planes stopping in the middle of air for a brief second before continuing. or planes simply vanishing like someone turned off a hologram

Been fun larping w/ u

It's not tautological at all... cogito (or in this case, typito) ergo sum.I'm here, and no matter your belief in a fancy-shmancy CIA holo-projected universe, I really did type this, and this planet *is* a Goldilocks planet.And the chance that non-pernicious info is folded into every single species' DNA quadrillions of times, with a way to circumvent RNA's non-conforming-therefore-discarded policy is a number so large that it would require every molecule in the universe to count it out on a cosmic abacus.

Maybe it was created by people for people to wonder at, to block out the sun and show a display of power. IDK why you would involve religion/creationism at all unless that was your own neurosis.

Well their argument, which I think is fallacious, is that if quite a few of the conditions on earth weren't *exactly* as they are, we wouldn't be here. That may be true but all it means is that something else would be here. There's obviously no basis to believe someone or something arranged it this way to suit us. The argument seems to be assuming that there is something essential about human life and a universe without us would be a pointless mistake. 

>  if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want   I didn't call you any of those things, but if you insist let's go ahead and put this to the test.   Show me one of these papers published on a website that was rejected from peer reviewed journals, which has empirical evidence of the Moon's atmosphere supporting liquid water and greenery. All it would take is a few spectroscopic measurements, anyone with access to a telescope and some basic equipment can carry that out and publish their data, so where is it? 

During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.  It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed.  New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed.  If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view.  

Huh. Fair point.  Now can you suggest any reason why only the side we can't see would have vegetation?

Why do you need a camera? Because you cant fake waves on the actual moon, but you can on video.All these "waves" are all in the same video released by the same person, lol You are being duped by someone that pushes pseudoscience to get subscriptions.  

LOL I am still laughing about this.  Where are the source videos, Crow?  I cant believe you took that video seriously.

I'm not saying you're wrong. You could be right.Where is it implied or suggested that this phenomenon is "thousands of years old?" For all we know this was first observed in the last few years because that's when it started. What evidence do you have for a fraud, other than an absence of evidence for it being a real phenomenon? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.I'm not suggesting anything, just pointing out what we can all see on the video. If you can explain how to achieve these effects within the constraints and also explain how a third party independently observed them from a different location, with separate evidence for it, then we can call it debunked and carry on with our lives. 

Good to know, thanks!

I'm still open to entertain that idea, but there's also the possibility of that kind of thing being a "distraction" or "misinfo". I just honestly don't know what to give more credence to.  The beings could be friendly and trying to help, but "they" don't want that, so they're demons or malevolent aliens. But on the flip side, they could be evil aliens or demons sure, and the people shouting the benevolent aliens idea could be trying to get us to trust these beings who mean harm. I'm just anxious about the future and hoping this is all coming to a culmination, but I know there have been others like me waiting for an "event" as well and they've died with nothing occurring. Let's hope there's something to this "Great" Eclipse and the 23rd that follows.EDIT: I also mean to try more psychedelics hopefully in the nearby future, I want to see what my consciousness has to say about all the information I have cooped up in there. 

Part of the fun of r/conspiracy is entertaining the possibility. Or at least it used to be. 

Got any links?

the fact that we have DNA is statistically slim?  What?  I need more info.

But what I'm saying is why would anyone who would create the moon need to make it so eclipses are present. It has no real baring on how life came to be. 

Not to further an argument that I also find fallacious, but it isn't just conditions on earth.  All of the constants in the universe (Speed of light, etc.) are so perfectly tuned that if they were changed by on millionth of a percent matter itself could not exist.  It's pretty mind blowing.

oh, i don't believe the moon is hollow, or supports greenery, i'm insane, not delusional, yet, and it's fairly well admitted i believe that the moon has ice on it, you can literally just type in 'moon has ice?' i'm too lazy too bother, and drunk, but the liquid water thing is probably bull, although looking it up on google search brings up lots of times mentions of water vapor, so there might be a little. don't see what difference it makes. 

> During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.Yup, and people today are still stoned to death, and there were death camps in the 1990s ... we're not so far from history.> It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed. New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed. If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view.A completely discounted, illogical and nonsensical point of view.  It's this kind of 'science sliding' that leads to the coal lobby and other anti-scientific scam artists to hold so much power, they take advantage of people who just want to "discuss a different point of view" and allow it to grow into a powerful minority which ultimately profits only a select few ...

Well, that's probably pretty unlikely.  It has been shown that our moon has a trace atmosphere, iirc from impacts and outgassing, but it's  pretty close to a vacuum.  There  is ice on the moon, and a trace of water vapor, and the moon is capable of holding a breathable atmosphere for (I  think) thousands or tens of thousands of years.   And there are Apollo images that look like liquid water, and are kind of tough to explain away, but I would bet they are something else like impact glass or some other substance.   The moon is a trippy place.**But do I think the other side has air and vegetation?  No.**   I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night side.  Space is so freaky and counter-intuitive that I don't  judge ignorance or superstition or conspiracy theories. 

Ok you have no idea what you're talking about.  It's been captured over a dozen times, from multiple states and countries.  But you stay ignorant in your brain cage of rigid skepticism so closed off you cant even learn anything new.

seriously , people get so angry 

Blocking out the sun is a pretty badass thing to do? There's different degrees of significance between Complete Coincidence and Created by God. Maybe the Face on the Moon is actually there and it was to show an ancient civilisations perceived mastery over nature.

There are so many "coincidences" that it almost feels natural, you know what I mean. The fibonacci sequence and Pi happening so often in nature is mindblowing. 

Liquid water and greenery was the specific claim that I was refuting at the top of this comment thread. You were seemingly defending that point when you responded to my request for a citation.

Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there.  

[deleted]

> I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night sideYes, this was a pretty stupid assumption on my part.  I can easily model it in my mind and see why it isn't the case.  I just always took the name at face value I guess.  It was an interesting lesson in my own ignorance.Edit:  For instance, solar eclipses exist.  I can be astoundingly stupid sometimes =)

Apollo? We never went to the moon

Then why is your only evidence a single video?

This isn't supposed to be fun this is a fevered rush for the truth 

Stick your thumb out and cover the sun, are you now a badass?

I think these things tend to lend credence to the idea of us living in a simulated universe.

yeah, i'm slowly getting more drunk, and honestly i don't really care about this anymore, i had to go over this statement like 3 times for errors, so have a good night, don't go to bed angry 

> Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I think both prey on the same types of mindset.> I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there.Certainly a stretch, but I do believe there is a significant 'trickle-down' effect when it comes to believing things for which there is no evidence.

Absolutely.

Pink Floyd didn't  help much.  ;)

[Oh, sure.   That's  what **they** want you to think...](https://youtu.be/ZNIFyy3i_1I?t=47s)

Well no because it only effects me from my perspective lol. If i had a giant thumb and blocked out the sun for this hemisphere it would be seen as badass by some people. Especially if they worshipped the sun.

Yes, but to be fair, I was a badass before doing so.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.Liiiiike, alternative fuels that might replace coal and other polluting fossil fuels.  

Ha ha looks like fun

> Well no because it only effects me from my perspective lol.Exactly.

> If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.I'm not saying that we should only accept what is known and proven, I'm saying that once a theory has reached a point that there is zero evidence to support it and there are mountains of evidence against it, then it should be treated as such.

Supposedly pretty crappy, but I like the idea.

Yes, exactly, putting my thumb out to cover the sun does only effect my perspective. Are you using that as a metaphor or something?

Everything is just relative to where you are. Just like you and your thumb, that's sometimes the moon and the planet. 

Yep, nice metaphor.
