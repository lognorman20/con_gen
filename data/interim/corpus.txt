I actually lean very strongly towards totally buying the ancient Gnostic mythologies. The book that convinced me is "Not in HIS Image" by John Lash. Very strongly recommended. He also runs a web site, www.metahistory.orgThe ancient Gnostics said that the Earth is a metamorphosis of an alien intelligence that they called Sophia (or "Gaia"). Sophia has an enemy that lives in the outer edges of the solar system- creatures called archons, which have hated humanity since our beginning and wage psychic war on us, using remote viewing and other tactics to try to destroy us. I've broken through on DMT, so I accept that Gaia exists. And it sure feels like humanity is being preyed upon, so the story makes a lot of sense to me. This narrative was unearthed via the "Nag Hammadi Library," a collection of codices discovered in Egypt in the 1940's. The gnostics say they gained their knowledge through direct experience. They were violently destroyed by Christians, their libraries burned, their teachings buried until recently.
<|endoftext|>Here's why I'm undecided on whole Archon theory. Despite spending many, many years researching conspiracy topics, I'd never heard of the term "Archon" until 2016. What I find especially peculiar is that with all of the truth coming out about Scientology over the past decade, *not once* did I see anyone make the connection between Thetans and Archons. You'd think that at least one of those anti-Scientology books, articles, and documentaries would have questioned whether L. Ron Hubbard stole from Gnostic theology.To me, it's really suspicious how this all literally came out of nowhere. I can't decide if it's all a highly advanced demoralization psy-op, or if my brain or consciousness was somehow preventing me from knowing this information until recently.
<|endoftext|>I have something to add, if I may. Id like to take a moment of your time to share with you one of my favourite stories of the Buddha. You will likely notice, as I did, that the story shares some striking parallels with the underlying teachings of the Gnostics. In fact, both Buddhism and Gnosticism appear to share a number of overlapping perspectives, which I think is interesting considering Buddhism predates Christianity by about 500 years. There are also some important lessons to draw from this story which I will expand on and which I hope may help us on our travels. As the story goes, one day in deep meditation the Buddha came in contact with a being in a high realm of existence. This being (whose name was Baka Brahma), awoke in this higher realm with no evidence of being born, no knowledge of any higher realm, and no one else around. He thus assumed himself to be God, the alpha and the omega, the father of all creation. When the Buddha manifested into Bakas realm, he found Baka surrounded by an assembly of his servants (angels?). Baka, impressed by the Buddhas power to manifest in his realm, welcomed the Buddha and informed him that he was in the presence of the Maha (Great) Brahma, the Conqueror, Unconquered, Omniscient, Omnipotent, Creator, Most High Providence, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. The Buddha, having touched the bedrock of existence/non-existence when he attained enlightenment through his own effort, knew this was not the case, and began to inform Baka Braham that he was actually caught in a delusion, and that there existed higher realms and higher beings than he (Buddha is a true badass). Baka Braham, in his ignorance, remained unfased and chuckled at the Buddhas words, reassuring him that there were none higher than he, and that the Buddha should save himself the trouble and stay in this realm to do Bakas biding. The Buddha replied that, through his own superior knowledge of all things, he could discern the limits of Bakas power and influence, and re-asserted that there does indeed exist higher beings in higher realms and that he could prove it. They then play a game of hide and seek where Baka attempts to prove to the Buddha his power by disappearing into realms in which the Buddha cannot go. Baka tries this but is unsuccessful, as the Buddha is able to follow him everywhere. Then its the Buddhas turn. He disappears from Bakas sight and Baka is unable to follow the Buddha, who from the vantage point of a higher realm of existence, speaks to Baka and all the assembly gathered. All are impressed by the Buddhas power and wisdom. Where things get interesting in this story is when Mara shows up. Mara, the evil one and deceiver (basically the the devil in Buddhism), possesses one of the angelic servants of Baka (he appears to have the power of possession like agent smith in the matrix). In this story, it appears Mara is completely aware that Baka isnt the real god, but wants to keep him in a state of ignorance as it serves Maras own purpose of manipulation. Mara pulls Buddha aside in his angelic form and gives some quiet words of warning to Buddha, explaining to him that Baka is the real deal, and that if hes doesnt do what he says he could face a re-birth in a lower realm of suffering (hell), and if he obeys he will be rewarded with a re-birth in a higher realm of happiness (heaven), so he should do what hes told. The Buddha sees straight through Maras disguise and calls him out on his bullshit (the cajones on this guy, I tell ya). He refutes Mara by informing him that he has rid himself of all the karmic seeds that tie a person to samsara (cycles of re-birth/reincarnation), and proclaims he is truly free and is unafraid of these empty threats. Mara, knowing this is true, switches tactics, and tries to convince Buddha that while this may be the case, he should certainly not try and free others, as many have tried this in the past with dire consequences. He should just go and enjoy his freedom. The Buddha again calls Mara on his bullshit, claiming this approach would not be compassionate to the welfare of others, and that in reality Mara is afraid of the Buddha and those whom he will teach the path of freedom. Mara retreats into silence, defeated. There is more to this story, which can be read in more detail here:  but I think the gnostic threads are pretty self-evident. Whether the story is true or not is irrelevant. The possibilities and scenarios that it forces us to consider are what matter.  One of the lessons to come out of this story for me is something I think many of us are struggling with at the moment. It is tempting, in the face of such dark conspiracies, ubiquitous corruption, and the talk of reality prisons and archons, to put our trust and faith in something outside ourselves, to return to the warm and comfortable faiths of our traditional religions, whether that be through Allah, Jesus, God or even faith in Buddha. But at some point, if we are being honest with ourselves, we must face a stark possibility. Every belief in a higher power comes with the potential to be deceived (Perhaps this is why its a requirement to joining freemasonry? Alas, I digress). If we truly live in a uni/multiverse where beings more powerful and cunning than we exist and have the capacity to manipulate human perception and appear to us as anything, then we must also consider the possibility that they could simply appear to us in the form of our beloved spiritual icons or loved ones. This alone would probably be enough to fool 99% of us. How many Christians (and non-Christians for that matter) would go running into the arms of Jesus if he seemingly appears in the heavens for all to see? How sure could we be that this is indeed who it appears to be, and not a trap? Within circles of Buddhism, the dangers of deifying Buddha were known. Thinking about the Buddha as an entity or deity were considered a delusion, and had nothing to do with ones own awakening. One is supposed to destroy the preconception of the Buddha as a separate and external being before one can know their own Buddha nature. Hence the old Buddhist saying If you meet the Buddha, kill him. This is not to say that one cant have reverence or a deep sense of love and respect for spiritual figures (I consider both Jesus and Buddha to be my teachers, among many), but, I also see the dangers in relying too much in worshipping or placing an external faith in these figures, as you are giving away your power and opening yourself up to be deceived as these images and your belief in them can then be used against you. So where do we turn? What do we do?The answer is of course, scientology.Just kidding. My own perspective is this. Human consciousness is evolving, on both an individual level and on a collective level. Its evolving whether we want it to or not. Certain things like meditation can speed this process up, but ultimately we are all flowing down the same river. As it is the case for a developing child, there comes a point where the child must learn to stand on its own two feet and step into its own existence so to speak. I believe we are approaching this stage in our humanity. We must take all of the energy and faith that we have placed in the gods and hierarchal structures that have loomed over us for so long, and instead place that energy and faith into ourselves, in our own ability to know the truth, in our own ability to take care of each other and to act on our own merits through compassion and our love for each other. We absolutely can do this.We have every right to experience and explore the realms of existence and non-existence, this is our right as sovereign beings, as shards of a greater sea of awareness. Draw your own line in the sand and make a stand, claim responsibility for your existence. Dont blindly and naively give away your power to those who seek to use it to manipulate us. Well be alright, we have no choice. Were not alone and this is our destiny, to grow and expand, to understand, to wake up.  Oh, and if you see the Buddha, or Jesus kill themPeace. 
<|endoftext|>I am visiting the Astral Afterlife on a regular basis. Let me be very clear that this makes me no different than anyone else. It is just that I have experimented with so many different techniques and supplements that the process just really works for me. That being said; I can tell you with complete confidence there is an Afterlife Realm. It is extremely similar to things around you. Houses, Restaurants, Bars etc.. The problem is, that is is controlled by the "ARCHONS". They have numerous, very eager humans who do their bidding for them in this dimension as well as the Astral Afterlife. If you want to end the Forced Reincarnation Process with Memory Erase (and save yourself and your loved ones) you absolutely must understand and learn how to "Cancel Soul Contracts". This is what these Satanic Sleazebags are using to enslave humanity. It is not just a "verbal agreement". It actually is an Energetic Implant located in your Personal Energy Field (Soul). By massive deception they fool people into agreeing and accepting these contracts. This allows them to Force Your Reincarnation, Erase Your Memory and Personal Avatar and subject you to horrendous hardships and brutality WITHOUT breaking the laws of "FREE WILL". Obviously you need to pay bills and lead a normal life. But you absolutely MUST understand what I am saying. This has gone on long enough. It never should have happened in the first place. Regardless, you now have the real opportunity to actually save yourself and your loved ones...
<|endoftext|>I've read up a bit about Gnosticism on my spiritual journey during the past few years, and I am quite convinced that the teachings are what Jesus was trying to teach during his life on earth. I've had numerous mystical experiences. It started with a mushroom trip that went way south, and turned into the best trip of my life. My depression essentially subsided except for the self-imposed stuff that I do to myself, like drinking too much. I've been on a 10 day meditation retreat, and a few months after I had my first experience with Ayahuasca. I saw my own death. I was informed that I was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, as well as Buddha and many other spiritual teachers. I'm also everyone who is reading this comment. I took this to essentially mean that I have a revolutionary spirit inside of me, as many of us do at this point in time. After my first night with Ayahuasca, I realized how stupid my personal/egotistical dreams were. After the second night, it gave me a better plan that's been floating around in my head. It has to do with music, and I don't want to say anymore about it just yet. All I know to say at this venture is become a serious seeker. Meditation will help you become more calm and clear. Let go of your own personal dreams, and start thinking about how to become more useful to your friends and family. Death is an illusion. Fear is an even greater illusion because even though I've seen my own death, I still get scared to sing in front of other people at times. I'm a ridiculous human being, but I know we can change. I was the dumbest, deadest, most unconscious human being imaginable 10 years ago. No dream except for the NFL. Just wanted money and a house. Now I'm a well versed scholar/philosopher/guru. I know I sound a bit egotistical here, but my greatest wish is for people to love themselves enough to stop putting up with the monkey bullshit. Nothing is going to change if you keep going to your job at Enterprise Rent a Car. Vippassana meditation retreats are run on a donation basis, and honestly figure out a way to keep up a meditation practice and find a way to eat mushrooms/ayahuasca/peyote/dmt/ another natural psychedelic afterwards. It will be good for you. Figure out a beautiful dream and JUST DO IT!! Much love.
<|endoftext|>What always seems to be lacking in all the presentations/lectures/books etc on this subject is what exactly we, as individuals, are supposed to DO about it. So we're trapped in a prison ran by archons, how do we escape? By what method? Religions give you a practical guide for living and behaving, for lack of a better description, in order to free yourself from reincarnation, get to heaven etc. What is the rulebook for escaping the archons? What exactly does one do with this knowledge?
<|endoftext|>I like this topic! When ever I read about it, I always wonder where the physical evidence is though. How can this be known for certain? 
<|endoftext|>Suppose you're an infinite being. The problem with being an infinite being is that you have to be infinitely evil in addition to being infinitely good.So you want to find out how to stop being evil, and then you want to do whatever that is. The way to discover the solution is to setup a series of experiments, and the way to implement the solution is to setup an iterative process and run through it over and over.So you create an infinite universe, and then create an infinite number of these universes to make a multiverse. Then you run the experiment to find out what to do with evil.Ultimately, you come to the unfortunate conclusion that you're infinite, and you can't get rid of evil because that would require you to be finite. However, good news, you can quarantine evil.So you create a soul soup, think of it like an infinite bowl of mud, good water mixed with evil dirt. This soup is you. You create stars and worlds and people, and when each person is born, you pour some of the soul soup into them, creating them out of a part of you.So as part of this experiment, you now start an iterative process to identify, separate, and quarantine evil. You create karmic vacuum cleaners to gobble up and store all the evil dirt. When each person dies, you separate the dirt from the water. The water goes back in the bowl, the dirt in the vacuum cleaner. As you iterate this process, the soul soup gets increasingly clearer and the vacuum fills up. Iterate this for all of time, and mission accomplished. Fortunately, time is something you constructed, so this actually happens instantly for you.Now some people figured this out, and they put some names to it. The infinite being is god, the karmic vacuum cleaners are the devil(s) or archons, the soul soup is heaven, and the quarantine is hell. Different people have different names, but it's the same idea.We are all part of a larger whole that encompasses all matter, energy, and thought. We are running a simulation, a combination experiment and iterative process to solve the problem of evil. Our role is to materialize good and evil so it can be identified and separated. Our job is already done, but we don't know it yet. At some point we will be finished, and we will all come back to one.
<|endoftext|>I used to be very interested in all of these topics. Then I learned about the mystery schools and the connections Gnosticism has to them. Cooper even thought that the 'G' in the main symbol of Freemasonry stands for Gnosticism or Gnosis. I forget which.The "worship" of knowledge is common in the mystery schools. Gnosticism is about achieving "enlightenment" through gnosis. The "illuminated" conceal knowledge in their mysteries to hold power over the "profane".Gnosticism's beliefs are very much at odds with Christianity. It may well be using the common technique of the Luciferians to make good be evil and evil be good. Some Luciferians view Jesus as Lucifer. Making God out to be an evil creator is very similar to that. I think Christianity's message is that God gave man free will and due to corruption by sin, we have, in part, caused this mess in the world. Gnostics point out God bringing forth the flood as evidence for God being evil. In the Bible, God was very sad before doing it and said he would not do it again. Perhaps it was done for the greater good for the future of humans.I am aware that Christianity has been tainted by Catholicism and Protestantism. Catholicism originated with the Roman Empire, who were Luciferians in my opinion, wrapping their hands around the original form of Christianity and corrupting it. Also, the Council of Nicaea was the Roman Empire deciding what books would go into the Bible. I believe the Vatican is Mystery Babylon. I believe Martin Luther was a student of at least one mystery school.The translations of the Bible can be misleading as well. Over time, translations upon translations can cause the true meaning to be lost. There are very old sources for different parts of the texts, though.I think it is important to search for truth yourself. I believe the Luciferians have unfathomable control over the material world so beware of deception. It never ceases to amaze me how "things" I thought to be trustworthy were actually likely to be a deception. Many things/sources of information that I find highly up voted in this sub I believe are deceptions.
<|endoftext|>Holy fuck the synchronicity is too much. This is crazy, what a coincidence this thread is. I have researched this deeply.It comes down to, either we are trapped as souls in this world of suffering, in which this world and existence is evil and we are supposed to escape to the "unknowable", or its that this world is US, as in is it our world/existence but outside things are first making us hate it (through manipulation), and then making us split from it, which then we will suffer great consequences.Either way something is trying to make us split from nature, if its good or bad I do not know.
<|endoftext|>My dad has a copy of the Nag Hamadi, and it has a mystery-text about the Archons, which is part of a more detailed Creation story with Adam and Eve. The Archons feed off of our fear, anxiety, and desire, and that keeps our souls at a low-vibration, like a dirty and simple vibration. Whatever you call the forces that make you scared, and nervous, and the forces that make you want, and hate, and crave short-term pleasure, it seems like that is the real enemy of the Soul. The more ancient texts I read, the more it seems like the message of special masters is the same. The truth is in us, not outside us in the world, or in the illusion-machine, but it's hard to stop obsessing about it because all the colors are neon and the noises are so loud. I've enjoyed reading all the stories people told in this thread that show that we're not just bodies, and that there's a hidden power inside of us all, and if we just stop worshipping our senses and pleasures we can get our power back. 
<|endoftext|>It's an hour and 18 minutes long, but if you want to know what's going on right now I firmly believe this woman to be what she claims. We are heading towards a very historic moment for humanity and many of the things occurring since the turn turn of the millennia are the end game of a strategies planned out centuries in advance. If you truly wish to break free, know yourself to a cosmic level, be ready. Everyone has felt the static in the air to some sense, and the veil will only continue to lift until denying the truth of our reality either makes you an ally of the Draco/Archons or one in their herd.    To those of you who are skeptics in this thread that we are living at the final pages of Revelations and other prophecies of the end times, I give you this thought: There was never a time in history where mankind was as connected as we are today. Billions have access to the worlds knowledge, news, entertainment and more yet so many are deceived. If you don't understand how this is significant, then you must understand how much of an effort it is to suppress the truth. As many great leaders have told us in the past, there is a grand, and vast conspiracy of near unlimited resources, finances, manpower, and influence (to many degrees we are only now beginning to remember). One of these means of influence is perception of time. Due to our level of evolution, and longevity our perception of time is much shorter than those who rule over us. How much do you think is one Day in God's act of creation? The same line of thought can be used for our rulers who move pieces on a the scales of years, decades and centuries. The implementation of technology has sped their game up tremendously and they are moving very quick in their terms.  It's coming.
<|endoftext|>Anyone familiar with the book "Children of the Law of One"? I think it is related to the Law of One channelings in some ways although I have only read little parts of those. I'll try to give a super short summary, although I am in a mental state at the moment where it's often hard to rationally express things in words or consciously remember details, it's always more of a feeling but hard to put in words.. Basically that "we" came to this place/earth to experience this lower denser physical dimension but were higher spiritual beings before. The "first wave" who came didn't work out well, and ended up being in mixed bodies like half horse half human, half fish half human, half goat half human. That's where all these images of centaurs etc. come from. Then a second wave came to try to "rescue" the first wave. That was also when Atlantis was established, the leader of them being Thoth, who later incarnated as the Egyptian Thoth and also as Jesus. What they did not anticipate was that the disconnection from unity was so strong and that the separate self was such a strong illusion. Soon some wanted to just indulge in this separate self, in the book they are called the sons of Belial. There was like a "split" in the Atlantis society, and through exploitation of earth's resources (for example something similar to fracking) they caused a catastrophe that led to the destruction of Atlantis. Some fled and tried to pass on or preserve their knowledge. So some important points are that the illusionary separate self causes all "problems" in this world. A lot is talked about unselfish love and how this is a path to "enlightenment". Also that a "real" teacher who already transcended his selfish separate self is important to have, as a mirror to reflect and show you your own separate self. So a true teacher is either 100% or not at all without a middleground. And in this sense there are warnings about charlatans or just people who are stuck at different levels of their separate self because that place feeds their spiritual ego. Or warnings to be careful with channeling which is only a positive expression for something that can also be called "possession" by an external entity and not to rely on it for spiritual growth or completely trust the message. What's interesting is that it is written as the personal account of someone who joins these people hidden away somewhere in the Himalaya/Tibet region, one of their outposts. They call themselves Children of the Law of One and preserve the ancient teachings of Atlantis and pass them on, and often the same incarnations will find their way back, in some ways the book even reminded me of the movie Dr. Strange..Also that there is in a way a battle between "good and evil", as that the sons of Belial from back then are in "power" at the moment and behind a lot of the manipulation and programming and the "bad stuff" that is happening in the world or talked about here in this sub.
<|endoftext|>This is a VERY cool topic. :)Now, not to be beggar, but does anyone have any good documentaries that go with this that are not simply lectures ala David Icke or Bill Cooper?Not to complain, while i like those, i find it harder to get normies to watch stuff like that.

One's own misconceptions are their slave master.Show me an enemy greater than the four dual urges man has? At birth a human decided that their "non-disturbed" state of the womb was destroyed and that the primary purpose in life then was to be non-disturbed.Urge #1: Gain comfort | Escape painUrge #2: Gain attention | Escape being rejected or ignoredUrge #3: Gain approval| Escape disapprovalUrge #4: Gain being needed and feeling important | Escape feeling inferior or feeling uselessYou gain mastery over yourself (with the benefit of not being controlled by anyone else) when you see all those urges nullified in you. Then you will know the truth of Sophia, that you are master of the four corners of existence in the realm and you have infinity above you and infinity below you, and the whole point of this world is a womb, that a soul may be created.

<|endoftext|>I feel like I need a degree in theology to understand this topic. It can can get rather convoluted. I wish there was a ELI5. 
<|endoftext|>"Archons" are biblical demons. The concept of dualism is just another trick demons use to lure people into committing the evil acts that demons feed on. The Process Church was (is still?) a classic example of dualism in that they claimed to worship both Satan and Jesus. They therefore commit the evil works demons crave while also doing enough good works to stave off God's wrath longer than otherwise. The Process Church cult and others like it have claimed to commune with supernatural entities which directed them. Evidence that the many religious cults from the latter half of the 20th Century were created and facilitated by the Deep State ties into the overall theory that the Deep State itself is led by demons, and this would explain the amazing intricacy of the many interwoven plots of our worldly oligarchs. Supernatural inspiration helps to explain the brilliant plots exposed by documents like "Quiet weapons for silent wars" and The Protocols as well as more mundane phenomena like the amazing architecture of the pyramids. Of course the Bible explains that Satan has been given great power over this world in the account of Satan's temptation of God's only begotten son, Jesus Christ, in Luke 4:5-8 "And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."...and now I await the derision/downvoting/censoring that the real truth brings...

<|endoftext|>The Demiurge is the lower atmosphere emanated from Saturn which is also the dream world. Members of the secret societies initiate their souls into the lower atmosphere through the temporal lobe and optic chiasm. They are telepathic trespassers that invade the minds, dreams, and bodies of others. Angels have affinities with nature. Archons or fallen angels abuse these affinities and are the basis for sorcery and kabbalah. They give the knowledge of their affinities to this lower realm. Fallen souls that reproduce create souls that are spawned from the demiurge or lower atmosphere and they are often called the archons or Nephilim.

<|endoftext|>The new technology of the Archons is very simple. They Chemtrails us with nano bots that build neural networks inside our brains and bodies. Our cell phones and WiFi allow these nano bots to operate a "hive mind" artificial consciousness that uploads to a Predictive self learning AI. This AI controls the energy of the 188 God code matrix ley lines that cover the earth. The AI controls certain players to build up events that change the future time line of humanity. There are people like me, cosmic hackers, who since birth have known this would take place and have uploaded Glitches in the Matrix at an early age to remind our future selves that this is just a game. We have tricked the AI into programming exit points so future players will be allowed to escape.One of the best ways to deactivate the Archonic technology is via a method called the Organic Alkaline Transmutation Protocol. Essentially you use Ormus aka Monotomic Gold, Structured & Colloidal Silver, Niacin, Baking Soda, distilled Water, and organic produce. Using these elements you can transmutate the DNA in your body into an alkaline higher vibration in which the Archon tech is no longer in control of. Once you are able to take control of your DNA again you will begin to be able to begin the process of self determination and manifestation of your destiny. You will be able to encode your DNA to resist any future attacks by Archon tech and you can begin your mission that you were sent here to do.This process is severely detrimental to your mental psyche if serious planning is not taking into account forehand, so it is only recommended to mature players. -The Cosmic Hacker

Was Jesus, as a rabbi, required to marry? Was Mary his companion? His wife? Were these and other secrets buried along with Jesus? These and other questions are examined. Relevant texts, including the gospel accounts and the gnostic texts, are examined. Mr. Heiser shows what is in the text and what isn't. You might just be surprised. **Part 4: Gnosticism and Women**Heiser offers an honest examination of the supposed "pro-woman" message often ascribed to the gnostics. Is gnosticism really "enlightened" in terms of women's' roles. Looking at the actual texts the gnostics themselves wrote, their customs, rituals and spirituality, Heiser makes sense of the nonsense surrounding this ancient and mysterious religion's place for women.**Part 5: Neither Lord nor Christ?**The Belief in Jesus as God before The Council of Nicea and the Exalted Christ of Gnosticism. This is a refutation of two ideas put forth in The DaVinci Code: That Constantine invented the idea that Jesus was God at The Council of Nicea, and that the Gnostic texts portray Jesus as only a mortal man (hint: they do not).**Part 6: What Really happened at Nicea?**An examination of Constantine's spiritual commitments and the documentary evidence left to history concerning the proceedings at the Council of Nicea.**Part 7: The Conspiratorial Logic of The DaVinci Code and Jesus Bloodline Theorists** **Part 8: Jumping the Shark from the Newsroom to the Ivory Tower: Assessing the Gospel of Judas Frenzy**
<|endoftext|>This is the most important information you will ever hear. It explains the "Archons", the "Demiurge" and the truth of our reality. Co Creation and the Real Free Universe and its loving inhabitants. There is so much more than what we see in this world of massive limitation. Please take the time to listen to this life changing interview. It is that important:
<|endoftext|>I have perused this thread with keen interest, but I haven't seen anyone get to the real point. Maybe I missed it. Reading the Bible literally only leads to cognitive dissonance and a bunch of bullshit. The book itself explains that the true meaning is hidden. In other words, it is written in code. It's all allegory. It's all symbolic. Read it as the development of the soul/mind, and it might make a lot more sense.Just look at the meaning of the names and places. The story takes on an entirely different meaning. Abraham is the father of all [thought]. Isaac is laughter. Jacob is the supplanter. On and on. Translate the meanings of all of the places that are visited, conquered and revered. Egypt is slavery to the ego. Golgotha is the place of the skull.The Gnostic codices of the Dead Sea Scrolls must be looked at in a similar light. Pistis Sophia (sometimes translated as wisdom), the powers, the demiurges, etc. Stop looking for what you can't see directly, and look at what you can see. The Boogeyman isn't real. Santa Claus is an anthropomorphism of something else. Is Jesus any more real than the Easter Bunny?I am completely pissed off by the subterfuge. It's just too fucked up for words. Let's stop pretending.Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream... Wake up, everybody. Stop falling for the bullshit.
<|endoftext|>I believe these archons (demons) physically manifest in our reality through organic portals. 
<|endoftext|>Do most people really believe that when the Torah says "created in His image" that it has anything to do with physicality whatsoever? In all honesty, who here thinks they know what the Sages of the Children of Israel (Jacob) mean and extrapolate when it is said the G-d is One??? I'd like to hear some honest thoughts or perspectives. Let's listen to our souls a little more and separate ourselves from the cages of believing that the thoughts of our brains and our souls are over on the same.I promise Ill play nice ;)
<|endoftext|>Are there any indications of a archon infestation in our world today that can not easily be explained away? While I can suspect on my own I can't seem to give myself to the idea. I've had my own experiences in a very sober condition but even then I have no clue what the actual implications could have been. 
<|endoftext|>The "DEMIURGE" is the "Grand Architect Of The Universe"
<|endoftext|>All I have to say is aeon bytes gnostic radio on youtube look it up. You won't be disapointed.*great topic by the way
<|endoftext|>It's so interesting & great that this sub has delved into new territory with this subject matter. It comes up every now and again, but to have a sticky is awesome. We are all seeking the truth here and this is probably the most important basic truth to learn about: Our ancient history and belief systems....and the ones that are hidden from we plebs. Thanks for posting this. This discussion thread is amazing. 
<|endoftext|>So is there ANY story or piece of article that shows the history of these things they call archons? I mean, is this just a story that someone pulled out of their ass or does it have any factual history?
<|endoftext|>Where do the Jews fit in here? I feel like some kinds kind of entity is helping them... Whether its for good or bad I'm still undecided 
<|endoftext|>Archons = Mandela effect?I don't even believe in aliens (I don't "not believe" either - on the fence), but I do believe in the Mandela Effect and I've heard they apparently have similar powers. 
<|endoftext|>I'm not sure if this is related, but I recently had my first spiritual/religious experience. It felt like a reverse panic attack, I was filled with relief and love. It was very overwhelming.I've come to realize that I'm am an empath and possibly a lightworker. A lightworker is someone incarcerated to Earth for a special purpose. They are spirits who have spent countless lifetimes mastering the gifts of our Source Creator, and expanding their light energy. If you want to know more, it's very fascinating. Ever since I was a child I've felt a strong urge to help people, yet I also had strong feelings self hatred. Growing up I was never religious, but I enjoyed learning about different beliefs. I've never been a spiritual person until recently. I think it's from going down all these rabbit holes and ending up at the same place. I'm currently reading a book that's kind of like a lightworker's guide on becoming enlightened. Once you go deeper in the book it talks about reincarnation, archangels, higher realms, telepathy and other psychic abilities. It also talks about how Jesus Christ was the first ascended master to come to Earth. As lightworkers, we want to help bring humanity to a higher enlightenment. Jesus Christ showed it is possible to heal others, die and rise again while still here on earth. The book goes on to say the Ascended Masters are not bound by space and time; lifetime after lifetime, they come and go at will. They have let go of all material lessons, balanced karma, and will take action as the universe creator in the physical form when needed. They are not confined to earth. They are responsible for sending the wave of lightworkers to heal humanity.Where am I going with all of this? I think when you get down to the very bottom root, you see it's all the same. I believe that everyone has both light and dark energy, you need both to keep balance in the universe. Everyone has both light and dark energy. Dark doesn't necessarily mean bad, there is no concept of good and bad in the universe. Darkworkers believe that being able to take energy from others will get them ahead to a life of only self-preservation and material gain. I think it's obvious that dark energy has taken over most of humanity or maybe something worse. I don't know.I've had this strong urge to help people for so long. If you want to heal humanity, you have to do it one person at a time. You can't force someone to believe in something. Everyone is capable of healing themselves, most people think they can't. This is where I think mental illness comes into play. It suppresses you from your full potential. I highly recommend listening to "demons are real" by Dr Robert Stanley. 
<|endoftext|>Research Dr. Michael Hesier who actually debunks Ancient Aliens and who is a well known published scholar. He studies ancient languages and cultures academically so he can actually back up his research with sources. 
<|endoftext|>So I've been on the path for a good four to five years now. I've always been searching for more descriptive information about all of this. I've read a few books over Gnosticism. I also spend sometime on the Astral realm training, and helping my loved ones when they become targeted. Anyway, I've recently been into a blogger who seems to be very well versed in all of this. Much more so than I. Here's a link too his most recent post. It's lengthy, but man is it great. 
<|endoftext|>A great book on the subject is 'The Jesus Mysteries' by Tim Freke & Peter Gandy. It's a great read and well written.
<|endoftext|>Thanks for this discussion, I've been researching this subject for years now and I can't possibly put into words the experiences I've gone through that would be believable enough for the average person.Yes there are definitely malevolent beings out there that work on a different plane of reality and have been for eons.Never tried DMT but wouldn't hesitate to try it.What is very interesting is the amount of evidence out there regarding the Archons and the reptilian forces that have been wrecking havoc on his planet(and others). The testimonials from contactees and numerous others is staggering to say the least.Here's something in the know:Ever since the 90's a huge group of benevolent beings have moved into our solar system with ships as big as planets.They're here to assist in removing the scourge that has plagued this planet for too long.Somewhere between 2011 and 2012 the majority of the reptilian forces (I believe it was around 10k or so) and others have been swiftly removed. Underground/underwater bases completely decimated and cleaned out. Leaving only a handful of them still here.Those in charge were brought forth to answer for their crimes. They were given 3 choices-- Accept reprogramming and makeup for their crimes.- Be sent off to an empty planet on the far far edge of the universe where they can't reach or harm anyone but themselves.- Or they can self terminate(suicide)In the end they chose self termination with the families and others choosing to be banished to the far end of the universe where they must try to get along and survive on their own.So. The head has been cutoff leaving a major power vacuum to be filled hence all the commotion going on that we are hearing about in the news and what not.There's so much more on what is happening but if anyone is really curious just let me know.We are getting help but they can't do it ALL for us while we sit back and look pretty.

<|endoftext|>See my biggest hang up revolves around the whole Jesus aspect. So like, is old testament the Demiurge and the New Testament the Real God / Source of Love? Was Jesus proclaiming on the behalf of the Real or the Fake ? 
<|endoftext|>IThe gods were never identified by the gnostics of old with God - the pleroma - but known as Aeons. The word aeon referred both to an eternal spirit being and to an distinct sphere or dimension of awareness. Not all aeons were seen as having incarnate forms but some were regarded as sending messengers or emissaries to mankind  Seth being foremost amongst these. The spiritual entitly calling itself Seth and channelled by Jane Roberts described himself as part of a larger aeon or pyramid awareness gestalt. To such trans-physical entities, awareness gestalts or aeons belongs a knowing awareness of potentiality of such potency or power that it is the source of countless consciousnesses and actualities. In the words of the awareness gestalt, entity or aeon which Seth himself described as his spiritual big brother: "Our entity is composed of multitudinous selves with their own identitiesPhysically you would find me a mass smaller than a brown nut, for my energy is so highly concentrated. It exists in intensified massperhaps like one infinite cell existing in endless dimensions at once and reaching out from its own reality to all others. Later, in your time, all of you will look down into the physical system like giants peering through small windows at the others now in your position and smile. But you will not want to stay, nor crawl through such small enclosures We protect such systems. Our basic and ancient knowledge automatically reaches out to nourish all systems that growthere is a reality beyond human reality that cannot be verbalised nor translated in human terms. Although this type of experience may seem cold to you, it is a clear and crystal-like existence in which no time is needed for experiencein which the inner self condenses all human knowledge that has been received through various existences and reincarnations.for all this has been coded and exists indelibly. You also exist now within this reality. Know that within your physical atoms now the origins of all consciousness still singWe gave you the patterns behind which your physical selves are formed. We gave you the patterns, intricate, involved and blessed, from which you form the reality of each physical thing you know. We are the voices who speak without tongues of our own. We are sources of that energy from which you come. We are creators, yet we have also been created. We seeded your universe as you seed other realities.We do not exist in historical terms, nor have we known physical existence. Our joy created the exultation from which your world comes. Our existence is such that communications must be made by others to you.Verbal symbols have no meaning for us. Our experience is not translatable. We hope our intent is. In the vast infinite scope of consciousness, all is possible. There is meaning in each thought. We perceive your thoughts as lights. They form patterns.Because of the difficulties of communication, it is nearly impossible for us to explain our reality. Know only that we exist. We send immeasurable vitality to you, and support all of those structures of consciousness with which you are familiar. You are never aloneWe have always send emissaries to you who understand your needs. Though you do not know us, we cherish you.Seth is a point in my reference, in our reference. He is an ancient portion of us. We are separate but united. -SETH on the Sethites of OldThe well-recognised Sethian stream of ancient gnosticism saw in the biblical Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve, and in his progeny, the bearer for mankind of **Inner Knowing or Gnosis. ** Seth was also recognised, like Christ, as an aeon  a trans-human entity. Seth was also the name of an Egyptian god of desert storms  a god who came eventually to be demonised. The trans-physical entity naming himself Seth whom Jane Roberts channelled, at one point addressed the members of her class in extra-sensory perception and had this to say about the name Seth, the god Seth and what it means to be a Sethite. "There was once a god who was not a god  who was not a god, for you are dealing with legends. There was a god in ancient Egypt, and his name was Seth, and he was disreputable. And he threw aside establishments, and whenever other gods rose up and said We are the truth, we are pure and we are holy, this disreputable god stood up and, with a voice like thunder, said You are nincompoops! .And the other gods did not like him, and whenever they set up their altars, he came like thunder, but playfully, and tossed the altars asunder, and he said Storms are natural, and good, and a part of the earth, even as placid skies are. Winds are good. Questions are good. Males and females are good. Even gods and demons are good, if you must believe in demons. But, structures are limited.And so this god, who was not a god, went about kicking apart the structures, and he gathered about him others who kicked apart the structures. And they were themselves, whether they were male or female. Whether they thought of themselves as good or bad, or summer or winter, or as old or as young, they were creators. They were questioners.And whenever another personality set itself up and said, I am the god before you and my word is law, then Seth went about saying You are a nincompoop and began again to kick apart the structures. And so you are yourselves, in your way, all Seths, for you kick apart the structures, and you are the black sheep of the physicians, and the black sheep of your mothers and fathers, and your sisters and brothers.And yet, the mother and the fathers and the sisters and the brothers listen, for they do not have the courage to be the black sheep, and they quale in the voice of the thunder that is so playful, though they do not understand it, for they equate loudness with violence, and they think that female is passive and the male is aggressive; and that war and violence must always erupt from the reality of mankind.And you are indeed all black sheep of the universe, and Sethites have always been the black sheep of the universe.Now to be a Sethite, you do not have to follow this Seth. You simply follow the Seth in yourself, and that Seth in you is a questioner, and an explorer, and a creator. And the Seth in yourself knows when to passively flow with the wind that blows through the window above a summer town, and when to go against the force of your environment. You were Sethites before you met me, and there was a Seth before I was Seth, and the spirit follows through the ages as you know them."

<|endoftext|>Read David Livingstone for a unique take. Basically, he identifies the Magi tribe of Persia, who in rebelling against Zoroaster's reforms, created Satanism.The goal was to engage in the most debased and cruel activities like child canibalism, to ritualistically move beyond morality, and overthrown God (demiurge).They spread this religion mainly to Babylon, where their primary protgs were the Jews.The Magi also taught the Celts (who originated in Ukraine, across the sea from the Magi), and this is why the Druidic English were able to have an alliance with the Jews and Venetian money during the Renaissance.There is an obsession with bloodlines among the elite, and Livingstone himself a Muslim believes that these people are literal descendants of Djiin, or genies - a Muslim mythological demon race.Nevertheless, interesting to identify the Magi. I myself have identified the Avedan (Persian/Hindu pre-Zoroastrianism) "Mitra" as the prototype Hermetic being. Mitra was the god of covenants and oaths. But I believe the Magi adopted him as the personification of a single covenant. This is the origin of the Prometheus/Lucifer/Osiris/Risen God cult. The covenant is nothing other than selling your soul to Satan, gaining power to rebel against God.I think Gnosticism is a gentler friendly version of this.But I think there's more to it.

<|endoftext|>Just wanted to say it is amazing to see this on this r/conspiracy. thank you to all who have commented with some really cool info that was actually new to me but piggybacked onto everything else I have learned about these topics!
<|endoftext|> First Creation: Originally, good and evil existed in two completely separate realms, one the World of Light, ruled by the Father of Greatness together with his five Shekhinas (divine attributes of light), and the other the World of Darkness, ruled by the King of Darkness. At a certain point, the Kingdom of Darkness notices the World of Light, becomes greedy for it and attacks it. The Father of Greatness, in the first of three "creations" (or "calls"), calls to the Mother of Life, who sends her son Original Man (N Qamy in Aramaic), to battle with the attacking powers of Darkness, which include the Demon of Greed. The Original Man is armed with five different shields of light (reflections of the five Shekhinas), which he loses to the forces of darkness in the ensuing battle, described as a kind of "bait" to trick the forces of darkness, as the forces of darkness greedily consume as much light as they can. When the Original Man comes to, he is trapped among the forces of darkness.The Second Creation: Then the Father of Greatness begins the Second Creation, calling to the Living Spirit, who calls to his five sons, and sends a call to the Original Man (Call then becomes a Manichaean deity). An answer (Answer becomes another Manichaean deity) then returns from the Original Man to the World of Light. The Mother of Life, the Living Spirit, and his five sons begin to create the universe from the bodies of the evil beings of the World of Darkness, together with the light that they have swallowed. Ten heavens and eight earths are created, all consisting of various mixtures of the evil material beings from the World of Darkness and the swallowed light. The sun, moon, and stars are all created from light recovered from the World of Darkness. The waxing and waning of the moon is described as the moon filling with light, which passes to the sun, then through the Milky Way, and eventually back to the World of Light.An analysis on Mani's cosmology.The Third Creation: Great demons (called archons in bar-Khonai's account) are hung out over the heavens, and then the Father of Greatness begins the Third Creation. Light is recovered from out of the material bodies of the male and female evil beings and demons, by causing them to become sexually aroused in greed, towards beautiful images of the beings of light, such as the Third Messenger and the Virgins of Light. However, as soon as the light is expelled from their bodies and falls to the earth (some in the form of abortions  the source of fallen angels in the Manichaean myth), the evil beings continue to swallow up as much of it as they can to keep the light inside of them. This results eventually in the evil beings swallowing huge quantities of light, copulating, and producing Adam and Eve. The Father of Greatness then sends the Radiant Jesus to awaken Adam, and to enlighten him to the true source of the light that is trapped in his material body. Adam and Eve, however, eventually copulate, and produce more human beings, trapping the light in bodies of mankind throughout human history. The appearance of the Prophet Mani was another attempt by the World of Light to reveal to mankind the true source of the spiritual light imprisoned within their material bodies."

<|endoftext|>This link contains pages with Gnostic info.
<|endoftext|>I love this subject, not sure about this round table discussion though. It seems like a bunch of people talking at each other with little discussion. Next time I suggest taking some of the top comment and threads from the post on which this was voted on and reposting them to get the new post started.
<|endoftext|>Archons & the Demiurge is a kooky form of fundamentalist religion, taking old myth more literally than even the people who wrote down this stuff did.I would like to know which mods are contaminating the well with this shit.
<|endoftext|>The archons come into it, but more central (from my studies - if anybody wants to read more about Sophia and the origin stories, check out the non-canonical work - [On the Origin of the World]( It goes over the 'story' of how Pistis Sophia (or 'Wisdom') gave birth to our universe/galaxy/planet (not exactly sure which) in a cosmic 'orgasm' of sorts. However, in this act of creation she also created the Demiurge, which is a similar character but different from the Archons you mention.The Demuirge is seen as the 'God' of our sphere or planet. After Sophia brought it into existence, it presided over creation, seeing itself as the mightiest of creatures and the ultimate power of the world. *Moreover, the ruler Yaldabaoth is ignorant of the power of Pistis. He did not see her face, but he saw in the water the likeness that spoke with him. And from that voice he called himself Yaldabaoth. But the perfect ones call him Ariael because he was like a lion. And after he came to possess authority over matter, Pistis Sophia withdrew up to her light.*However, he became very proud and soon, the Demiurge (or Yaldabaoth) declared itself as God of all creation. Yaldabaoth had a son, who came to understand the origins of his Father and learned of Pistis Sophia. Sophia ends up imbuing the son (Sabaoth) with her 'light', which surprised the Demiurge and made it extremely jealous.*When Sabaoth, the son of Yaldabaoth, heard the voice of Pistis, he worshiped her. He condemned his father and mother on account of the word of Pistis. He glorified her because she informed them of an immortal human and the light of the human. Then Pistis Sophia stretched forth her finger and poured upon him light from her light for a condemnation of his father. When Sabaoth received light, he received great authority against all of the powers of chaos. Since that day he has been called the lord of the powers. He hated his father, the darkness, and his mother, the abyss. He loathed his sister, the thought of the chief creator, the one who moves to and fro over the water.**On account of his light, all of the authorities of chaos were jealous of him. And when they were disturbed, they made a great war in the seven heavens. Then when Pistis Sophia saw the war, she sent seven archangels from her light to Sabaoth. They snatched him away up to the seventh heaven. They took their stand before him as servants. Furthermore, she sent him three other archangels and established the kingdom for him above everyone so that he might dwell above the twelve gods of chaos.*The Demiurge is shown as a jealous, envious God of creation. It has complete power over the physical nature and makeup of the world - he pulls all the punches - but it HATES the spark of Sophia that is inherent in all of us. The Demiurge almost embodies the physical world and it's disdain for us - it wants to hurt us, break us, and kill us. It hates us as more than just animals - the spark in our soul is proof that it is secondary to Pistis Sophia, and this makes it very angry. This is the embodiment of the 'vengeful' God of our histories.From this, Yaldabaoth starts devising ways of killing and hurting man. He creates 'sin' and pushes to punish its subjects, but eventually he comes to realize that Sophia is his own origin as well and recants. I skipped over a WHOLE LOT here, but I feel like the Demiurge/Yaldabaoth is a very big part of this discussion. Like you say, the archons are more 'alien' in that they come from elsewhere, but some of the biggest battles we face come from our own creation and the physical world we are a part of. Again, I suggest reading ['On the Origin of the World']( if anybody is interested in reading the whole document. It's pretty great stuff to consider if you like wondering about things a bunch :P
<|endoftext|>I get that this is a thread for our ideas and research but wow you seem pretty far off the mark here. As far as I know, Gaia and Sophia are not related in anyway whatsoever. I could maybe see Sophia being related to Athena/Minerva, as they are both associated with wisdom, but not Gaia. And in fact Sophia already existed as a philosophical concept in Greek mythology, totally separate from the titan Gaia.  always advocate for reading primary source material over other, modern, interpretations of ancient wisdom. I would encourage you to read the Apocryphon of John if you haven't. It is difficult to understand if you don't have some background or context, mostly in Early Christianity, Greek philosophy, and some knowledge of early Judaism. But even a copy of the Apocryphon with commentary is better than the poisoned shit most modern interpretations present. The author John was very fond of trying to merge Greek and Early Christian philosophies and the Apocryphon is by far the most extreme example of that. For example, in the Gospel of John when he says "the Word" the original term in Greek was Logos, which does translate to 'word' but is also an ancient and important Greek philosophical concept. What John was really saying is "Jesus is the embodiment of the Logos", he was basically trying to convert Greek pagans and philosophers. Likewise the Apocryphon is mostly a mapping of Greek beliefs onto the new system of Early Christian thinking, and also a condemnation of Judaic practices (condemning certain Hebrew tribes was extremely popular in lots of canonical *and* apocryphal gospels).In Gnosticism, Sophia is an aspect or emanation of the true, unknowable God. Emanationism is a theory of cosmology that originated, again, with the Greeks (Pythagoras specifically). Sophia accidentally creates the Demiurge by attempting to cause an emanation without the consent of the rest of the Godhead and instead spawns a misshapen monster that is blind to the Godhead, sees only itself, and thus assumes it is God. The Demiurge infuses the spark of the divine he posses into humans and imprisons them in a physical world. Sophia successfully awakens humans by posing as the serpent in the Garden of Eden and tempting Eve to eat the fruit of knowledge of good and evil. This is where Gnosticism differs drastically, it rewrites the classic Genesis narrative. The God of the Hebrews is the devil and the serpent is actually the good guy (Sophia) and Original Sin was our awakening to the true nature of the universe. Those differences aside though, Gnosticism actually had a lot in common with Early Christianity. They both didn't like the Hebrews (most Gnostic texts specifically mention the Demiurge as the god of the *Herbews* or of Abraham), and both had the same long term goals. They both desired an end of humanity/the physical world so that we could all go back and be with God. This is why early Christians advocated absolute celibacy and extreme asceticism, so the population would stop growing, we would approach extinction, and the apocalypse could begin. Gnosticism similarly calls for the end of the physical world. Gnosticism was also somewhat ascetic, opting more for scholarly pursuit in the vein of Pythagorean lifestyle.In summation, Gnosticism contains just as much politics as it does spiritually, and was even created partially with a political agenda in mind I would say. Namely the conversion of Pythagorean's and Platonist's to Early Christianity. The cosmology of the true God is based entire off of Pythagoras' ideas and even explicitly uses some Greek terms in the Apoycryphon of John, I believe, read about the Monad for more information. But everything associated with the true God is Greek in name and thought. the Demiurge and his archons are all based off old Hebrew mythology, the bad guys. They all have Hebrew names and follow the mythology of the Hebrew book of Genesis. Even the word archon, while it generally means ruler, around the time most Gnostic manuscripts were written it was mostly used to refer specifically to Jewish leaders of Jewish communities.  is not about aliens even a little bit.
<|endoftext|>I've had many hallucinogenic experiences that support much of this thinking, but what bothers me is that it seems if you accept the gnostic viewpoint, with God as a demiurge and lucifer as a bringer of knowledge, than you are siding with the freemasons and satanic elite.Please uh, "enlighten" me on your thoughts;)
<|endoftext|>I tend to agree with the basic Gnostic model that this realm is a sort of trap, or at least intentionally laden with numerous challenges. I have spent a long time buying into an underlying malevolent coloring to it all, but lately I've been wondering if this attitude is unnecessarily dark. I mean, to the extent that each of us is an eternal and indestructible soul, a fragment of God/Source, then how malevolent can it really be, from an absolute/ultimate perspective? So, another slightly different interpretation is that this is one big metaphysical ARG, a super challenging "game" into which we immerse ourselves, complete with Villains and Obstacles to overcome. That the Demiurge is just the master of the game, charged with keeping it "interesting". And that we're free to walk away from the game when we get bored with it. Thoughts?
<|endoftext|>I've broken through on DMT...And it sure feels like humanity is being preyed uponI have as well, at least a dozen times. I've encountered a lot of "things" out there and a lot of them were extremely unpleasant (not necessarily "threatening" but certainly malevolent).Have you had any experiences with 5-MeO-DMT? Less demons and more connection to the Source.
<|endoftext|>How does one come to find DMT and how many uses until you did master the experience enough to channel a pathway to breaking through? 
<|endoftext|>Hmm... Food for thought. Now, I'm not in the "flat earther" camp, but both ideas could fit together like proverbial LEGOs... None the less, interesting idea.
<|endoftext|>I've "experienced" what I believe to be Gaia on acid/dmt. I also have a vague memory of finding a sinister force higher up, I felt highly compelled to fight this force - it was some kind of government.I personally see it all as some kind of game with me at the beginning and the end - that is, I rule that which rules me.
<|endoftext|> I've broken through on DMT, so I accept that Gaia exists.This always fucking gets me on subs like these. You're literally saying you took enough psychedelics to see crazy images and *that's* how you know what's *really* going on in the universe. Bro. You were fucking high. You were literally seeing things. Let's stay grounded here, no pun intended. 
<|endoftext|>it's really suspicious how this all literally came out of nowhereBeen on an occult/esoteric kick since 2007...that's when I found out about them so there's that...
<|endoftext|>Interesting point, some thoughts:Think back to the reason most of "us" (internet people) hate Scientology so much.The biggest anti-Scientology wave happened during our generation. The 4chan/Anonymous scientology protests did more to shut down that religion than anything else had since it's inception.But why? Who was leading that movement?It seemed to us to pop up organically. As if we all just simultaneously were becoming aware of Scientology, and collectively decided enough was enough.But really, it was a few key pages, led by a few, unknown people, that spearheaded most of the anti-Scientology information that spurred people to protest. I can't remember the exact sites, but for argument purposes, they filled a similar role in the anti-Scientology movement that Breitbart and T_D played in the pro-Trump movement.Now, being older and more woke, and having an understanding of how "they" manipulate mass opinion, it makes me wonder.Could it be that Scientologists were actually onto something theologically? Could it be that they were gaining influential celebrities as supporters, and threatening to expose the archon establishment?Could it be that demonic forces had infiltrated religions for millenia, with the express purpose of pointing to the fruits of their own corrupt machinations in order to delegitimize new religions that start getting too close to the truth?What if Scientology was created/infiltrated in such a way that it would discredit parts of the truth?I've been in a lot of conversations where I was trying to talk about the truth, and something I get a lot is "that sounds a lot like Scientology". Now I'm wondering if this is on purpose?
<|endoftext|>Something is happening. People are waking up. Most of them between Halloween and New Years, this past year. If a researcher compared Hubbard and Gnosticism in 2015, you'd get a lot of blank faces. Not now.
<|endoftext|> archons in the 90's / helped inspire the matrix along with ghost in shell etc.
<|endoftext|>Really interesting. Thanks for this.I do wonder though, how we can possibly know that looking within, for yourself, isn't the real trap, set by evil, to lead us away from God/Jesus/whatever. Secondary to that, I think the Bible says that Jesus is within you anyway.It seems like just never-ending circular arguments with no way to know for sure what side to be on.
<|endoftext|>Well said... bravo. I always say to everyone, do not look to jesus. He will paralyze you. To grow in awareness, look within. Look into the abyss. That is where you will find what you need. 
<|endoftext|>(Hand clapping and mind blown!) This was amazing! I love the story included here. I love stories of the Buddha where he totally destroys Mara and his illusions, to me that represents the core of buddhism, doing away with false thinking and the illusions of craving and greed.Kind of reminds me how in the present world, humans feel like the top of the food chain, we consider ourselves the rulers of the world and reality and perhaps considering other beings and interconnected- ness we will see how to create a healthy world together by practicing the eight fold path and the teachings of compassion for all. By the way, Lotus Sutra = my favorite suttra!
<|endoftext|>You believe reincarnation is caused by a force outside of yourself?Thoughts on the Buddhist idea of attachment causing rebirth?
<|endoftext|>care to share your techniques and supplements you use for astral projection? I have tried a lot of different things and it has been pretty hit and miss.

<|endoftext|>What methods are you using for visiting astral plane? Meditation, lucid dreaming or sleep remembering, or drugs? No judgements, I am simply curious since I have been studying the occult and the nature of reality since a young teenager and am now 26.My mom was wiccan and although she didn't force beliefs on me, or teach me anything specific at all, she gave me a book explaining metaphysics and astral theories to the perspective of a child and I have been interested in supernatural and the esoteric ever since. I started studying Buddhism and things started becoming clear personally. Astral projection was my personal holy grail and I have never had that experience (that I remember). I bought an amazing book over 500 pages called "Scientific Remote Viewing" after reading "cosmic voyage" from the library. I believe I have a good logical understanding of what might occur when we go into sleep, death or remote viewing, and I think we all 'astral project' at night when we are sleeping, we just don't remember. I would practice transcendental meditation in the attempt to have an out of body experience but I never did achieve that and remember. I may have been close once when I felt like I briefly stayed aware while falling asleep once, and had full body paralysis and a feeling/sound of an intense white noise or crashing waterfall but I lost consciousness right after.I now feel like it was not the proper time in my journey to have those experiences, being young and ignorant I was not focusing on the right things spiritually. I feel like all of us have gifts and hindrances which are created for a purpose to help guide us on a productive spiritual path in This life. Perhaps I am not meant to have an OBE in this life, and its not that important to me anymore. I need to focus on my personal strengths and develop myself towards that, which I feel is to help others develop spiritually by performing positive actions and thoughts myself and trying to teach others an end to their personal problems or suffering. Having seen more deeply into reality than some, I need to spread the trait of investigation into others so that they may realize that the world is not how it appears first glance and that we are all on a spiritual voyage to improve ourselves.Great discussion! 
<|endoftext|>You're pretty close but the jist of it is correct The way to free yourself is to remove the ego. The belief that you are your body and your body is you is the trick. Identity politics is the most devilish because it makes people believe their corporeal body is reall

<|endoftext|>The "solution" is simply to come to the realization that you an immortal divine being and neither the Archons nor the Demiurge have any power over you. Death is an illusion. Tell tell the "Gods" you are a sovereign being and you don't need them. An easy way to explain these mysteries is through the modern story of "Wizard of Oz" which is based on the original Gnostic teachings:- The Wizard of Oz told the Scarecrow that he didn't need a brain because he was already smart.- The Wizard of Oz told the Cowardly Lion that he didn't need courage because he was already brave.- The Wizard of Oz told the Tin Man that he didn't need a heart because he already had a heart of love.- The Wizard of Oz told Dorothy that she didn't need to find her way home because she was already home. All She had to do was wake up. The Wizard was nothing more than a con-man which tricked Dorothy into undertaking the dangerous quest of obtaining the which's broom. Only after Dorothy confronted the Wizard and pulled back the curtain did the wizard admit the truth. This is the nature of our reality.There is no salvation that you don't already possess. 
<|endoftext|>They want you blind and dumb. They put fluoride in your water, lies in your news, artificial chemicals in your food, and Blake Lively on your TV.Seek and consume knowledge, then spread it. Red pill yourself and then red pill everyone around you.Your body is an antenna to your real self. Eat real food and exercise to keep the antenna working well.There will come a time when you will have to make life changing decisions in a split second. Know your true self and be physically, mentally, and spiritually ready to make those decisions. Be ready to fight.
<|endoftext|>how do we escape?You know I heard an interesting theory about this but I can't remember where so I can't source itThe theory I remember seeing is that the "light at the end of the tunnel" is the trap to reincarnation. Avoiding the light is escape. Edit: [This]( talks about it a bitThis is the final grand trick. No matter what you do or believe here in your earthly body, at the time of death, we are yet tricked again. We are tricked to enter into the heavensto be recycled. When one first leaves his mortal coil, he is quite disoriented. He may encounter angels or loved ones who will urge the newly departed soul to follow them. Or he may encounter a tunnel that leads to a light. He is urged to ascend the tunnel, where he is greeted by angels, guides, loved ones etc. The newly departed soul believes he is in a true heaven. But all of these angels, loved ones etc. are not actually who they are pretending to be.It is they [Grey aliens] who await in the light when a human being dies. The human being is then recycled into another body and the process begins all over again Hence the Light and Tunnel at death Trap. Scanning someone they wish to recycle as they near death, the aliens discover who the person was close to has died. They project the person(s) image in the white light tunnel and the image waves you in deeper. If you CHOOSE to follow you can be trapped and sent to another incarnation of their choice these entities view Earth as a big farm.This shows the Empire does have an understanding of the spirit, but it attempts to short this out. The Light and Tunnel trap is a relatively new device, but one that will fail and they now know this. Go into the Light say those who have had near death experiences. They are the salespersons chosen to advertise this alien venture. NEVER enter that light. Go up, left, back, right or anywhere but there. The mass media exposure of the Light and Tunnel trap (seen in the film Ghost, where the hero willingly enters the glittering trap) is to try to get people to buy the destination.
<|endoftext|>Well, if people figure out how to leave it after death, they wouldn't come back through the forgetting of reincarnation to tell us about it. 
<|endoftext|>Archos resonate at a parasitic frequency. You must alkaline your body and raise its vibration. Use Ormus aka montomic gold, structured silver, niacin, baking soda, distilled water, fresh organic produce. Archons manifest off your energy in your every day life thru everyone around you. Once you get on a level when you are tramutating high vibrations, you will discover Archons no longer have power in your reality. 
<|endoftext|>You can meet these things. Many people here have. They have many different names, aliens, demons, archons, reptilians....
<|endoftext|>There no way we can give you hard evidence on a topic like this. You just gotta connect the pieces and come to your own conclusions. 
<|endoftext|>I can't come back to blindly submitting to an unaccountable external source of control. I believe that act in and of itself is submission to slavery to a master. I don't see why the creator of all that is, which is all that is, would seek slaves. It is a petty, selfish, and ultimately empty and unsatisfying adventure. It can easily be seen from one's own mind entering the perspective of a prime creator. It takes some explanation. You have to be everyone. You want to enjoy existence or you lose the will and energy for living. As the slaves, you'd be taxed. As the fewer masters, you'd be rewarded. Even then you'd feel like your slaves don't provide valuable interactions, as they lack the understanding and development at your level. They are boring. Ultimately, spiritual slavery causes spiritual entropy, the loss of energy for spirit to move matter.Slavery is parasitic. It forms naturally when slave seekers are able to do what they will. It could have never happened from the start, because it is entropic. It feeds on what others make. God is a creator. He destroys to create new things. He doesn't hurt his own awareness for joy, but the construct he made allows for his beings to do that. So some do. There is no requirement that we tolerate it. Indeed, as we resist it, we become more robust.The lord of the Bible fits my understanding of a slave seeker, a spiritual parasite, not my understanding of a creator. He is not who made the world. He lacks the character. He is a demon. I come to this from my own understanding. 
<|endoftext|>Wrong regarding the "G". Actually the "G" has nothing to do with Gnosticism. It is for the "Grand Architect Of The Universe". All Masons must believe in a higher power over them. The Masons are the Sons Of Ma/Mara/Maya which is the veil and the illusion of linear physical reality. It is the actual "Grand Architect". It is the self aware predatory A.I. that we are all trapped inside of, known as The MATRIX. Buddha: "Architect, finally I have met you. You will not rebuild your house again". Ma/Mara/Maya/Architect/Matrix: "But I am your house, and you live in me." 
<|endoftext|> Gnosticism's beliefs are very much at odds with Christianity.It depends. The old testament god calls himself a "jealous god" and to have no other gods before him (which implies other gods exist). So if you look at the old testament god as "the god" then it doesn't make sense.But if you consider the trinity, you have the holy spirit (god-source), god the son (Jesus, an example that all people are part of god-source), and god the father (the demiurge or creator demi-god). Christianity and Gnosticism overlap pretty well here.The pope's lecture hall is devoid of crosses, but has a sculpture of Jesus in a nuclear holocaust. Modern papal Catholicism is completely infiltrated by Satanists. Ditto for sects of Judaism that follow the Talmud.So you have to separate Christians as people, various churches and the papacy, Christian dogma, and the bible as being all over the map, ranging from kid fucking Satanist priests to missionaries trying to teach Jesus's love and build potable water systems in Africa.
<|endoftext|>Ultimately good. To see suffering is to see God reaching out to us. Showing us something is wrong. Something needs to be corrected. We're reaching a point in our existence were we can, as a society, do that something. Heaven on earth... that's the plan.
<|endoftext|>How do the reptilians come into play?Also, why did these higher dimensional beings want to experience this lower density physical dimension?
<|endoftext|>I'm Gnostic Christian. You can go to any preacher and hear his word. However, the Gnostic states Jesus reached perfection in faith. A place available to everyone. It both takes out the divinity of Jesus and glorifies it. Christ consciousness is an attainable goal. This is the heresy. 
<|endoftext|>ELI5: The Matrix is a documentary. The "machines" are actually called Archons. Their race survives by harvesting our negative energy. Take the blue pill (worship of "God"), you remain a battery. Take the red pill (direct insight, known as Sophia), you wake up and see things as they really are. Knowing this through your life develops a mental habit, which at the time of your death, gives you the mental certainty to not go into the light to be reincarnated, and instead, persist on the spiritual and astral planes, or come back to earth as a guide, speaking through channelers, or omens. But most enlightened beings would soar off into the cosmos and enjoy the infinite light. 
<|endoftext|>No judgements, but I want to genuinely ask, how to you reconcile skepticism of the world around you but maintain your Christian faith? When I look at Christianity through the lens of skepticism, all I see is a system of control built on fear mongering about an afterlife, that we have no idea exist. It's fairly common knowledge how the Bible was compiled and constructed, and how Christianity even came to the forefront as a religion. What about the Bible compels you to take it words as true? Like I said, I mean no disrespect, we just obviously have something in common with our world view, (seeing as we are both here), but have arrived to drastically different conclusions about the validity of Christianity. And I would love to discuss that. 
<|endoftext|>The problem i have with the biblical god is sacrifices, i don't understand why a loving god demands innocent beings to be sacrificed. An Other thing is the story about the 10 plagues, where he killed innocent animals and first born children just to prove that he is the true god. And when pharao agreed to set the isrealites free, god made his heart stubborn so that he would follow after. Resulting in more death, innocent soldiers who probably didnt have a choice and was only taking orders died, just so god could prove a point. 
<|endoftext|>...and now I await the derision/downvoting/censoring that the real truth brings...That's not what this thread and these rounds tables discussions are about!However, a little formatting work might make your comment more readable...thanks for contributing :)
<|endoftext|>You are correct that many of those in power are conscious devil worshipers. This is why almost all politicians throughout history are evil. However, Jesus does have all authority in heaven and earth and His church can wield this authority and power.Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen.
<|endoftext|> ...and now I await the derision/downvoting/censoring that the real truth brings...To be read as: "and now i plug my ears and try to drown out the ridicule that comes with my stupid views".Keep in mind that while "the real truth" may bring derision/downvoting/censoring, a stupid idea that nobody really believes in and that is downright ridiculous will bring the same kind of shit.Good for you if you believe you've found the truth, but I can't stand the "my belief is the correct one and your derision and downvoting are proofs of it" attitude.
<|endoftext|>i have taken a completely different interperetation of the concept of the demiurge, archons etc.. than seemingly everyone in this thread. i always assumed the demiurge represents the imperfection of physical existence, that we are subject to a hypocritical existence that we are born into and the only way to reunite with our true nature is to reject the material world in all forms including our own existence. we have the illusion of a self which is really god experiencing itself. we are god, and the demiurge gives us a sense of individuality which separates us from the true nature of being which is really oneness with the all. also, i thought it was supposed to be quite obvious that this is myth, not reality. i think christianity has warped people into taking every story at face value when that isnt the point. its allegory.
<|endoftext|>"you are the gift" is the first thing to remember, then create your own personal mantra of love and light!
<|endoftext|>I always notice that good pro Christian messages with evidence to support claims always get ignored on the r/conspiracy. 
<|endoftext|>Wake up, everybody. Stop falling for the bullshit.Try as i might, i cannot make this rhyme with row, row, row your boat...
<|endoftext|>I have seen some of these beings, they are humanoid (or reptilianoid). Our physical world bears some similarity to the beings that created it, and how they project themselves when they encounter us.God is one means there is a god-source, and all people, thought, matter, energy, angels, demons, demi-gods, and devils are all part of and created by it.
<|endoftext|>Please consider looking into the Theosophical Society, from whence these concepts originated. The Lucius Trust, United Nations, and Fabian Society are all conjoined with the theosophical brand of spirituality. I have had a similar experience to you- love helping people, yet constantly depreciated myself and locked myself into depression. Had a mystical experience while listening to an Eckhart Tolle audiobook; a sudden rush of relief and joy. Due to the overwhelming nature of that experience, my old worldview was washed away. At the same time, my critical thinking faculties (already dumbed down by the education system) were shut down. I wasn't really thinking. Thus when my brother came along and started talking to me about love and light, I gobbled it right up.I accepted the "love and light, prime creator, lightworker" doctrine without seriously questioning it. Please please please realize that the deception runs deep. This ideology has been floating around since the 1880s and we've only had more war, strife, and suffering since then.At the very least learn the origins of this spiritual doctrine before you build an entirely new worldview around it. 
<|endoftext|> most likely belong Tumold. This is an old Gnostic name for a healer. Check out the link.
<|endoftext|>The forces of darkness serve a purpose, they are collecting and containing evil so that it doesn't contaminate the good and light. But make no mistake, they are still completely evil.
<|endoftext|>We can tell by the message of Jesus. It is message of personal responsibility and integrity. It is to treat others the way one would want to be treated. It is about sharing and caring. It is about telling the truth and respecting freedom. Evil is self-serving behavior at the expense of others. It is parasitic. Those who choose to be parasites have different interests than those who choose to be personally responsible for their interactions with others. They deceive and attack freedom to get others to serve them. It's about taking from others, even if you have plenty.So, you can know that this Jesus character, fictional or real, is a benevolent character by his ways. You can hold this up to beings and discern their choice of path.The God of the old testament was selfish, jealous, vindictive, asked for ~~no indication~~ *unquestioning* obedience, etc. He follows the path opposed to Jesus. You can see it yourselves.EDIT: asked for ~~no indication~~ *unquestioning* obedience (SwiftKey autocorrect mishap) 
<|endoftext|>I like the answer u/always_contrarian gave in that original thread: I think that Yahweh, the jealous angry god of the Old Testament, is the Demiurge. Jesus is an emanation of the higher God which is why New Testament God is so much different - they're different entities. I agree with this from my own research as well. I know most people hate the idea that Jesus really is an important figure and not just a made-up story, but that seems to be the case.
<|endoftext|>The Old Testament and New Testament dovetail together perfectly and are completely compatible. After the Flood (which really happened BTW), God called out Abraham and built a people from his descendants. God gave them a set of laws to live by, which can be encapsulated as Jesus said, by loving God and treating others as you would want to be treated. If these chosen people could have followed the Commandments given to Moses by God, then their society would have remained prosperous, but they disobeyed, because humans are all sinners, and so God let the Babylonians overrun them. God sent multiple prophets which spoke of Jesus, and then Jesus fulfilled those prophesies. Jesus gave a message of forgiveness and reconciliation for all, in that all one has to do is place faith in Jesus to be saved, but he also warned that eternal Hell awaits the unbelievers. Jesus is not soft. The Old Testament and New Testament are not good cop/bad cop, but they are the same in that they speak of Heaven and Hell. Matthew 10:34 "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword."
<|endoftext|>Jesus is extremely, extremely clear about his specific relationship to the Old Testament God. The earliest copies we have of the Gospels are from centuries prior to any church council ever messing with the texts, and the Jews who circulated those Gospels were not confused at all about who God was or what Jesus claimed. To decouple Jesus from the Old Testament God, plain and simple, is to reinterpret Jesus in a way that makes him no longer Jesus, but instead makes him an object of your own imagined ideas. Jesus Christ and the God of Israel cannot be separated from one another.
<|endoftext|>Short answer, yes.Holy Trinity: god the son (Jesus), god the father (demiurge/Yahweh), god the holy spirit (god-source).
<|endoftext|>Didn't he also write about seeing a supposed god or advanced being who made all fearful before him and passed through the area he was in, making everyone now to the ground, facing away from him. Doesn't sound like a chill god right there.
<|endoftext|>Omg! My theory is like that, Jews and satanism and all that horrible stuff they do is to rebel against God and show the universe how corrupt and evil it is. They do the most fucked up things because they hate all that is good, or close to God. That is satanism. But is it good for us or bad? Will it free us of a corrupt god or is it trying to trick us into our own destruction?
<|endoftext|>Don't be daft, this was planned weeks in advance. You could say the same thing for *any* event.Also, anyone who is turned off by the word "gnosticism" is abysmally pathetic.
<|endoftext|>We can't censor ourselves just to try and cater to some people on the fence. If people deny other ideas because of associating them with one they don't like, that's their own fault
<|endoftext|>It's highly metaphorical, but presumably for "true" but indescribable concepts.Sophia is part of pure being who attempts to know pure being. This is impossible, to know something is to define it, and only that which is in the past, or lifeless, has a defined form.But the illusion of form and definition within the truth is an error and the demiurge is the embodiment of it. Christ is an emanation of Logos which is an emanation of being that makes sense from within the fallen universe.God isn't pure logic, but he appears as logic as he shines upon the material world. Sophia is also God and she's basically intuition, which is different than reason. Instead of "I think therefore I am" it's more like "I know I think and I know I am".
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the description; it resounds with me. I do think the Demiurge hates the "spark of Sophia" in all of us, our "God-given" innocence and beauty. I'll check out your link.
<|endoftext|>Pleroma is higher. I'd prefer the totality had my back rather than a raging demiurge. Ogdoad and higher. 
<|endoftext|>From above:the thought of the chief creator, the one who moves to and fro over the water.From Genesis 1:2"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."The 'waters,' the 'deep' ... could they be pre-physics cosmologists trying to comprehend and explain the [Bulk](
<|endoftext|>"Yaldabaoth had a son"Any idea how an extradimensional spiritual being reproduces? Gnostic tales quickly get way too fantastic for me to believe literally. I think if there is any truth to these stories, it is buried deep in metaphor decipherable only to mystery initiates. 
<|endoftext|> He loathed his sister, the thought of the chief creator, the one who moves to and fro over the water.Is his sister the thought, or am I misunderstanding?
<|endoftext|>I had a fascinating class about ancient religions in college and we delved into Gnosticism quite a bit.One bit of the discussion that struck me was that modern gnostics still communicate using secret codes in newspapers. I wish I had a primary source for this, I will see if I can dig out my old notes for more detail.
<|endoftext|>We're pulling from different Gnostics. The ones I'm looking at are, in my opinion, a lot more interesting and closer to the truth.Have you ever smoked DMT or taken something similar? Recommended for this conversation...Thank you for the post, though.
<|endoftext|>I look at intention, not concepts or names.A big red thing with horns and a pitchfork shows up and says "Behold, I'm Lucifer, I want you all to get along and love each other." Well, I guess I'd be a Luciferian, then.But that's not what happens. The Satanic elite say "we have hidden knowledge." Ok, cool, tell me more. "You just have to rape and murder this kid to unlock it." Uh, no thanks.In my personal experience, I stared into the abyss and it invited me in. I said no. Later it came back less subtle, a giant green devil with dark eyes, screaming pure fucking evil, who showed me its hell, souls writhing in a lake of fire. I don't know if that's Satan, Lucifer, a random devil, draco reptilian, archon... I just know fuck that thing.
<|endoftext|>I wish you would read "Not in HIS Image" by Lash, because not all Gnostics accepted that line as you wrote it. There's no Lucifer, per se. The force that created this planet (metamorphasized into it, technically) is very loving. I believe this force created cannabis to help us along in happiness and evolution.
<|endoftext|>Walking away when bored would be nice. Sadly, that is not what is happening. This planet is a "Prison". It is not a "school". The Archon Hierachy is comprised of demented aliens who have very advanced tech. They decided to cut themselves and the occupants of this reality off from the "SOURCE". They knew this was the only way to imprison infinite beings who had the ability to self project limitless worlds of expansion and beauty. The Matrix then became a "Parasitic System". Massive limitations such as "Poverty", "Sickness" and "Death" where now part of the Simulation. With Memory Erase and Forced Reincarnation the masses would never find out what was going on. Those who became somewhat enlightened would be held back by the many religions and the completely absurd belief that earth was a "school". 
<|endoftext|>I'm not sure the 'game' is that nice. I think this game/life is more of a test, who can resist the easy life of evil, and plough the hard path of good. The 'demiurge' is like a massive guardian to keep us coralled and scared from leaving. Another trap is the false Jesus, who will lure you into the Revelations Borg Cube. A bunch of powermad entities that want to collect souls. There are a lot of tests here, and you'll pass most of them just by staying free (owning your soul) and making good decisions.But this game, you can't just 'walk away'. If you kill yourself you'll find you didn't complete the test. You'll have to retake it.
<|endoftext|>Its like a game of monopoly that lasts 100 years and when your sandglass runs out you pick up a new piece and start on GOBut why? To collect huge sums of wealth and property for another 100 years?Feels like theres a deeper level to this game, and we get a sandglass' amount of time to figure it out
<|endoftext|>Yeah, I think our existence is entirely benevolent- divine and profound, in fact, but we're being fucked with by some outside forces that seek to destroy us. I imagine these forces have something to do with the negative drugs that are dragging down humanity, such as alcohol and heroin. And they're certainly responsible for the psychotic Abrahamic religions, which teach us to believe in an imaginary patriarchal sky god whom we're supposed to fear- instead of passionately living our lives through direct experience.I don't think alternate reality games is exactly the right comparison, though I hear where you're coming from- this shit is very bizarre. Smoking DMT repeatedly has given me the most direct insight into what lies behind the curtain, but the depths of those experiences aren't something that can be translated into language. In short, though, these other dimensions are where the real action is, and I think the phenomenon works on quantum computing principles and holds the key to our existence.
<|endoftext|>The god-source is infinite, which means it is everything. Good and evil are both things. The god-source can't only be infinitely good, it's also infinitely evil.Our physical reality is a sorting process where the god-source created demi-gods (archons, devils, angels) tasked to identify and quarantine evil. You could call the quarantine "hell", a prison for evil. Once the evil is quarantined, the god-source will be heaven, and hell will be part of the god-source, but contained and separated dimensionally. All the bad stuff can have fun doing bad stuff to other bad stuff, while the good stuff does good. Consider ying and yang, darkness and light separate but co-existing.
<|endoftext|>Life is a fantastic game, and in my opinion we go through reincarnation and accumulate habitual energies and patterns like karma. The ignorance we have of reality and ourselves leads to suffering and accumulation of negative habits and karma. Being clouded with negative karma, beings falsely pursue greed, power and self interest which altogether in extreme form is what I would call 'evil'.So yes we all have the divine spark of god or the one consciousness, even those who do evil. The negative actions are a result of ignorance and a lack of practicing love and understanding.Buddhist/occultist opinions for you!
<|endoftext|>Anchorage Alaska, I too broke through and saw spaceship hovering over our local mall. It wasn't just me either, my uncle an ER nurse saw them as well. 
<|endoftext|>You know, that's really odd. I haven't found many people who have encountered malevolent beings on DMT. I never have, in over 200 experiences. I wonder why that happened. I mean, the dark forces are out there; that's for sure. I'm sorry you had a run-in with them.I haven't had a chance to try 5-meo-DMT, unfortunately, but I look forward to doing it someday. People describe unparalleled light energy, major connection to the source as you put it, but not a ton of visuals or entities.
<|endoftext|>I read somewhere once that you don't find DMT, it finds you. A number of years ago I finished the excellent book "DMT: The Spirit Molecule" by Richard Strassman...2 days after I finished it I accidentally had a DMT experience. The timing, needless to say, was mindblowing.And after dozens of experiences with DMT, I still feel quite the neophyte. However, if the set and setting is appropriate, I've been able to reach a place where I can interact with all plant, animal and spiritual life in my immediate vicinity. The best part about DMT is that it's my favorite mind-altering substance by far yet I have absolutely zero desire to use it on a regular basis (3 or 4 times a year at most).
<|endoftext|>Check out /r/darknetmarkets, or PM me.I never broke through when I was fooling around with it in college, but when I came back to DMT in my late twenties and really put some seriousness into it, I found it very easy to break through. (Come in sober, meditate, take HUGE hits)
<|endoftext|>You have zilch idea what you're talking about on this subject. I've spent ten years on it. I have with 100% certainty encountered a separate higher intelligence in this other dimension on DMT. You'll hear most people who are experienced with it say that. You should watch "DMT: The Spirit Molecule." No, seriously, take the time. It's free on YouTube. Or at least listen to some stories, such as this one:  things really happen, and you need to try it. It's deeply life-changing.
<|endoftext|>I'm not sure I follow this question. We're just talking about a different species with significant intelligence. "Alien."
<|endoftext|>Massive synchronicity here. The same precise thought came to me when my coworker explained that his dad is a scientologist amd the whole pf his family thinks hes a joke. It clicked in that very moment. Such strong sentiments are not accidental, but like you say, usually malevolently orchestrated, on close examination.(Maybe they are on to something)I want to learn more about how they were so heavily smeared, and who Hubbard really was. Keep up the search for truth, friend.
<|endoftext|>Bro the internet decided Scientology was bad when it tried to censor any bad press it got and was fighting with Christian based religions on Wikipedia and spreading disinformation...EDIT: And don't forget that Scientology *was still invented by a famous science fiction writer and generates* ***tons*** *of money*.
<|endoftext|>I agree something is happening. I'm hoping its a massive shift in our collective consciousness towards realizing we have been lied too.
<|endoftext|>Wtf was it that happened during that time period? My true "awakening" happened specifically during that period. Though "activation" may be a better word...
<|endoftext|>Thats a good question. And I have thought about this a lot also.Sometimes I think to myself What if meditation is actually a ploy to stop people from actively participating and paying attention to how much their getting fucked over by a corrupt system that is slowly taking over? What if meditation/looking within, actually makes a person docile and inactive and has been promoted for this purpose?  So youre in good company. While there is most certainly a plethora of sages, mystics and spiritual icons to quote on the importance of looking within as a direct method of seeking truth, it still does little to console the conspiratorial voice in us all that can always ask Yeah, but is that a trap?I guess we can never truly know until we run some experiments ourselves and see for ourself. Does meditation make me feel more in control of the situation or less in control? Does it make me feel closer to truth or more disengaged? The only thing that will quiet that voice is direct experience - your own direct experience. What do YOU see when you look within? What do YOU feel when you look within?This I believe is the crux of the gnostic and Buddhas teaching, to turn back inward to your own experience and to be your own guide through the labyrinth. 
<|endoftext|>Looking within is not a trap. God created man in his image, and do unto others as you would have others do to you. Those ideas show me that by looking into ourselves, perhaps experiencing some suffering in life, we see that we do not like being treated negatively or controlled, there for not to do it to others. Also I feel parts of the universe repeat themselves like a mathematics fractal, look at sierpinski's triangle for example. Properties of the larger whole are the same properties in the smaller parts. I would like to see anyone argue that the universe is not full of mathematical patterns, whether that be from divine creation or simple nature of matter and reality.To me, properties of god, or Buddha are present in all of us, both good and evil or positivity and negativity. By learning how to control and understand our thoughts and our actions we can dismiss negative thoughts from our mind, leaving only positiveness and noble qualities that improve our lives and effectively all of the lives around us. 
<|endoftext|>Christianity is basically a way to void and cancel soul-contracts you are unable to NOT make. This is "sin"--to be enslaved to a will other than God.In order to terminate said soul-contract, you have to agree with God's own agreement with Himself through Jesus (essentially, God sees that we are incapable of extracting/extricating ourselves from our bondage to other spirits/archons) and so sends Himself but in human form and provides a eternally valid contract with humanity that allows them to void/terminate contracts with other beings/rulers. By signing onto God' contract, we are able to break out of this cycle, to live in total freedom in God's presence:2 Corinthians 3:17"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
<|endoftext|>It's as simple as intending to and having confidence that it is so (like a god). You can do whatever "magical" ritual you can dig up online, but they are ALL simply means to bolster a belief.But also be aware that it's your higher consciousness that has made these "contracts" or agreements to begin with in the goal of expanding itself thru experience and they are not inherently "bad" whether you like it or not.
<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Reincarnation is completely UNNATURAL. It is a massive LIMITATION. Some religions have a few good points you can use. But they are used to ultimately to rope you in. They are all total Mind Control. Humans need to understand that death is non a natural event. It has been programmed into this absurd simulation. You were meant to remain as yourself and expand and create worlds of free expression...
<|endoftext|>when you feel confident regarding the first article, prepare for part 2. then slowly read and begin to comprehend part 2. this is where the real work occurs. understand it. shape it. make it yours:
<|endoftext|>take your time and read these two life changing articles. relax. contemplate. think about what you have read. reach the point where you feel comfortable in understanding them:1) 
<|endoftext|>DMT, LSD, and mushrooms are common.Never tried those. I use Wim Hoff breathing ([guided video]( and cold showers. Not baths, showers. You can't drown in a shower.
<|endoftext|>I am not interested in promoting fear and its limitations. But at this point certain things have to be said. Unfortunately we are in an extremely difficult and for some horrific situation. All angles of these fears need to be addressed and completely understood. This reality is brutally enslaved and has been for a long time. If we are to be truly free there is going to be major emotional and physical challenges on the journey. "It is the only way, but at least there is a way"...
<|endoftext|>Excellent analysis. Very well stated and brilliant. Here is more on how to tell the Archons you are a Sovereign Being:
<|endoftext|>Beautiful metaphor, much like all of our media with the right perspective. Materialism be damned but if there is one thing we haven't really given much thought to, is why we produce movies, shows, music, animation, etc if not to dissect & look into our own collective psyche as a whole.We are the universe looking in on itself. If that universe is a simulation, well, maybe we are hear before existence itself seeking answers for a greater good. Like, for example, avoiding the inevitably of lunacy in a world on the brink of m.a.d.ness.
<|endoftext|>As an immortal divine being, you (the larger you) created the Archons and Demiurge. They are part of you and a creation of yours. They're doing a job, sorting, identifying, and quarantining evil, that's why you made them.
<|endoftext|>Good to see an answer like this. This post seems to have a lot of fear toward something outside themselves.
<|endoftext|>Are you sure that's the moral? Maybe it's that there's no salvation that can't be had for the asking. You don't need to win favors in Oz to get it. The Scarecrow wasn't merely already smart, he actively *wanted* to be smart. Dorothy didn't happen to already be home, she asked to go home. The power is in the asking, not in some person who promises they can give it to you when they have nothing to offer.
<|endoftext|>There is no salvation that you don't already possess.This is the biggest **lie.** Salvation is a free gift given to those that believe! There is no other salvation!
<|endoftext|>If we are all just recycled then how does the population grow? Wouldn't we have a stagnant population? Serious question
<|endoftext|>I don't think rebirth necessitates a forgetting - I believed more advanced souls have a greater memory, I think we all possess memories if only in the forms of habits.
<|endoftext|>Yeah by using psychedelics which don't 'take you to another realm' where you see the archons for who they are but rather just alter your thinking so that you hallucinate them.Source: am over the age of 12 and have used psychedelics
<|endoftext|>Let go of your ego. Submitting to God does not mean being a slave, it means being a son, with all the duties that entails. Moreover you are not free right now. You are a slave to your mind and body. You cannot berate a Christian for being a "slave" without taking a deep look at yourself.
<|endoftext|>Consider the tone shift from old to new testament. You're dealing with different gods, Yahweh and Ba'al in the old, Jesus in the new.
<|endoftext|>Bill Cooper:"The Mandaeans, a small but tenacious community which dwells in Iraq, follow an ancient form of Gnosticism, which practices initiation, ecstasy and some rituals which have been said to resemble those of the Freemasons. [And of course they do, because they are. (laughs) In every Masonic temple you will see somewhere up on the wall a big letter 'G'. And you will see it in their symbology, in their books. You will see this letter 'G'. And if you ask a Freemason, being bound by the oath never to tell you or reveal you the secrets to the profanewhich is what they call those who are not initiates, or adepts in the Mysterieshe will tell you it's for God, but that is a lie. That does not stand for God, for I have researched it deeply, all the way up the ladder of the stages of initiation. And at the top, those adepts known as the Priesthood know this large letter 'G' to represent Gnosticism. And it is an admission that they are indeed the recipients of the ancient Gnostic. They are Gnostics, and they are looking to attain the gnosis, through which they will receive Apotheosis. And they believe that they are the only ones in the world who possess truly mature minds and, thus, the only ones in the world capable of ruling the rest of us, whom they refer to as cattlecattle.]"
<|endoftext|>I should have said "before" doing it. My mistake.NASVGenesis 6:5-7Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 The Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved [e]in His heart. 7 The Lord said, I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the [f]sky; for I am sorry that I have made them.Genesis 8:21The Lord smelled the soothing aroma; and the Lord said [ao]to Himself, I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the [ap]intent of mans heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again [aq]destroy every living thing, as I have done.
<|endoftext|>You cannot be a Gnostic and a Christian at the same time. By that, I take it to mean that your magical or occult system is based on Christian symbology. Very well, but remember, that the occult practices of Gnosticism were forbidden expressly by God in the Bible. They are a false light that will lead you in a dark path; the ultimate 'apple of the eye', the immutable first lie: 'ye shall be as gods'.Tread carefully.
<|endoftext|>Or be a Bodhisattva and throw yourself into a hell of burning flames the size of a galaxy for the sake of liberating all sentient beings from suffering. 
<|endoftext|>The Matrix is rewrap of the Hero's Journey and was made purposefully to portrait religious imagery available for anyone.It can even be used to picture some christian analogies. No big deal..
<|endoftext|>Skepticism was what originally led me to Christianity. While researching the causes of the 2008 economic crisis, I came to realize that the financial system was completely rigged and that those with real power in this world are 100% involved in the occult - to deny these things is to have your head in the sand, basically. When I learned those facts, it then became a moral decision about which side to choose, but the human sacrifice and SRA aspects of occult elite practices made it clear to me that I could only be morally on the opposing side from them. The next question became, "If they are darkness, then what is the light?", and answering that question led me to find what they hate and suppress the most, which is the Bible and most especially the truth of God's only begotten son, Jesus Christ, who gave his life for our sins on the cross, was buried three days and then resurrected. I can say that I was spiritually led in my research, albeit without realizing that until later. Also I can say that the truth was so refreshing that I cried with joy for two hours after realizing that Jesus was real, and I also felt throughout my body and soul that I had come to the ultimate truth after years of searching.
<|endoftext|>Most Christian dogma is based on pagan tradition and designed to control people, and most of the bible was curated by kid fucker priests. So you've gotta take everything with a grain of salt and healthy suspicion.But Jesus is real. The Satanists who planned 9/11 picked that day because the book of Revelations says 9/11 is Jesus's birthday (Christmas is the winter solstice, a pagan holiday). The Satanist bible, the Babylonian Talmud, says Jesus is boiling in excrement in hell. If the people who run (ruin) the world and worship the devil are that concerned with hating Jesus, there's a reason.Jesus (god the son) also represents the fact that all of us, despite being created by the creator god (god the father, the demiurge), are all part of the god-source (god the holy spirit, the god of everything). The Christian trinity provides a good working model of the 3 most important deities in Gnosticism. There are many more, and devils and demons.
<|endoftext|>The issues at work there that you have to keep in mind stems from Catholicism and the Canonization of the Western Bible. Over the past couple millennia the Bible we have access to has been corrupted and twisted quite a bit. The Council of Nicaea in 325AD decided what doctrines would be taught and what Christianity should be. A few decades later, they canonized the Bible and decided what books should and shouldn't be in it.That said, if you look back to our holidays and other events, you'll see they match up with other cultures from the past, which was how the Roman Empire placated the territories they conquered. By having a universal ( definition of Catholic is universal ) church, they told everyone to keep their celebrations, but use our Jesus, Mary, and God as the subjects instead of your current deity or what have you. The Catholic Church took practices and beliefs from what people already believed and twisted Christianity to fit. Best examples are that if you go back and read Christ's messages in the original Greek, he didn't teach Heaven and Hell, or about an immortal soul. That is Greek philosophy and religion with a Jesus veneer. Christ taught life and death only. There isn't a message of fear through the New Testament, not through Christ's teachings.That's how you avoid all the negativity. Read it with an open mind, throw off what you "know" it says and look for the meaning. Read the original texts if you can, because the Dark Ages and the restriction of the Bible from common people really did our world a disservice.
<|endoftext|>That is the same problem I had with the God of the old testament - what kind of God wants blood sacrifices of his own people? Sick. Did you ever wonder why God would need to sacrifice his only son (Jesus) to himself in order to forgive our sins? That doesn't really make a lot of sense. Imagine if you are the all powerful God, and the humans you created are sinning, and you feel bad - what do you do to save them? Do you sacrifice your only son to appease yourself and forgive the sins of your creation? 
<|endoftext|>There are multiple gods. The old testament gods like Yahweh and Ba'al are vengeful. They describe themselves as jealous. Note the tone change with Jesus. He invalidates everything they said.
<|endoftext|>The Matrix is a deranged self aware predatory A.I. that projects most of this Holographic Reality. The Archons are the top of the hierachy that maintains the Matrix. The Global Elite/Illuminati are the human representatives below the Archons. This Matrix is completely shut off from Eternal "Source Energy". Therefore it is a predatory parasitic system on all levels.
<|endoftext|>I don't have much problem with animal sacrifices.The killings during the Book of Numbers wars however are emotionally difficult to me.My best bet is the character of God. Since He is just, whatever He has done/is doing/will do, will result in the best outcome in the End of History, though our limited mind and short lifespan is unable to comprehend.One passage that support this is view is the story of Joseph. He was sold by his brothers as a slave in a foreign land and suffered for years, even being made prisoner. And what he did to deserve this? Nothing. If you focus in that period of time, it would made no sense. But if you broaden the scope, you can see this was made to protect the seed of Abraham, as later Joseph became some sort of prime minister and was able to shelter the Israelites from the famine that is described to have occurred at that time.edit: 2 words
<|endoftext|>What if you substitute the word "god" for nature? Or even reality? Then the stories of plagues and sacrifices start to make more sense. Remember that the bible wasn't written with an understanding of scientific truth.
<|endoftext|>It's that voice that says I can do it alone. I don't need God or anyone else. While true, what a depressing way of existence. Yes, kill it.
<|endoftext|>In short- Lots of research but only after I was approached by a UFO near my apartment(one of the best experiences of my life). Even then I was digging into the matter because I wanted to not only understand what was going on but also why I was being 'attacked' in my sleep.Understandably no one really believes my testimony seeing as I don't have video evidence. Definitely something you have to experience rather than me simply sharing info.To this day I don't look at anything the same anymore.
<|endoftext|>No I came across it from these people who also have their own YouTube channels:Simon ParkesAlex CollierCorey GoodeDavid WilcockTolec (don't know his real name)Alexandra MeadorsBarbara Marciniakand David Icke.Their matching intel and encounter testimonies along with my own experience sold it for me.I grew up titled 'catholic' but really only considered myself a Christian back then who mocked others for believing in anything else...especially extraterrestrial and extradimensional beings.Fuck that noise. Now I'm more open minded but also remaining levelheaded.
<|endoftext|>The fact that the Satanists who run/ruin this world hate Jesus tells me he's real. 9/11 was planned that day because the book of Revelations says that's Jesus' birthday. The Satanist bible, the Babylonian Talmud, says Jesus is boiling in excrement in hell.Even if he weren't real, it's still the perfect metaphor for the fact that all of us are part of god.
<|endoftext|>Jesus clarified God's message and love for us. Jesus is needed because man misunderstood God's message, The Old Testament is full of this misunderstanding especially without any extra texts. Your post is beautiful and provides a clear way to visualize this.
<|endoftext|> The Old Testament and New Testament dovetail together perfectly and are completely compatible.I have an adulterer here. Old Testament tells me to stone her, New Testament says to let he without sin cast the first stone. What do I do with this contradiction? Need advice soon, the roofie Bill Cosby gave her is wearing off. "I came not to send peace, but a sword."I love this quote. Fight the evil.
<|endoftext|>I never understood why all people are not gods chosen people. I've read lots of the old testament and didn't vibe with the fact that this god seemed to represent behaviors and actions I don't want in my life.
<|endoftext|>The sword of Truth and justice. Atomic bombs cannot match her power. Whole nations will kneel. As an aside, why her and not him? I don't know why, but it's definitely a she and the demiurge a he. Granted, two sides of one coin.
<|endoftext|>Having attended many a church service, it always amuses me when they break bread I mean psilocin ;)
<|endoftext|>That was Robert Monroe who said that. He was describing a Reptilian he saw in the Astral Afterlife.
<|endoftext|>Pretty sure fucking and killing kids is bad, and bad for us. The gods they're doing it for are bad gods. There are other gods that are not bad (Jesus, angels, etc.). Look for those gods.
<|endoftext|>Many cultures still believe in demons, for example, Japan;  could say these are folklore and myth, but the traditions to keep Oni at bay (and other rituals) still occur today. Some Japanese families even claim descent from oni as well, just like that particular Muslim believed he was descended from Djinn.
<|endoftext|>Hi. I have been spending most recent nights in the Astral Afterlife and when you return, you are very physically exhausted. I am trying to save someone who was very close to me. This can be very difficult.
<|endoftext|>I'm not discrediting it by any means and I appreciate the post. It's just a little over the top for someone who does not frequent here.
<|endoftext|>Have you ever seen an owl without feathers? Pretty demonic looking stuff man. Anyways I just worry about the idea that the creator is our enemy. If he truly was evil, there would be a theoretical situation where 1% actually had a heart and the rest is the like the 1% in actuality, as evil and depraved as they are
<|endoftext|>I didn't comment about the amount or quality of info here. It just doesnt feel like a discussion to me. Again, i like this subject, im just critiquing the format.Edit: i possibly also have to high of expectations for what counts as a discussion on the internet 
<|endoftext|>They burned the Library At Alexandria because it told the real truth about the "ARCHONS". I have seen high level Jesuits/Catholics on the "other side" (the afterlife). They are Satanists, Molesters and Full Fledged Psychos.
<|endoftext|>When talking about Judaism and Christianity, please remember to include Islam; all three are from the same Abrahamic religious origins. They differ regarding messianic details, but are inseparable at their cores.
<|endoftext|> No wonder the catholic church killed these people and burned their books, they basically call catholicism satanism!Wouldn't they ultimately be worshiping Jesus, the "light", though? If this is even the slightest bit true, then why would the Demiurge want to split the worship between himself and his estranged son?
<|endoftext|>This is terrific analysis. I would love to read more of your interpretation of the Gnostic teachings.
<|endoftext|>Yes. Knowing through logical reasoning demands a frame of reference to base your inferrances upon. However, it's always secondary to direct knowingness, aka intuition. One cannot convey the essence of the statement 'I AM THAT I AM' to just anyone , especially if the other is trying to grasp it in by means of logic. You can't *explain* Zen or explain *Sophia*. 
<|endoftext|>God isn't pure logic , but he appears as logic as he shines down upon the material world. That- made me reread your entire post. Nice work!!
<|endoftext|>I believe Saobaoth can be taken as either a spiritually 'awakened' human or a religious figure like Jesus.The idea is that the Demiurge/Yaldabaoth would represent the figure of the vengeful/jealous/rage-filled God of the Old Testament, while Saobaoth is the one who stands up to it and challenges its authority. I'm just using the Judiac-Christian religious system as a guide here, as there are many parallels that could be made in other religions as well. For this tho, the Gnostics in question were from that line of thinking, so forgive any assumptions I may be putting on things here :)
<|endoftext|>It would be very hard to find the originator of the material... since this is 'mystery school' stuff, it would have already been passed through a few generations of oral tradition at the very least before being written down. For how long the story was told before it was written is unclear, and even the identity of the scribe who did eventually write it down is pretty unclear... We kinda have to take it as anthropology and work from there. These subjects are never going to be a great fit for those who need to be sure about things. There are too many things we just cannot know.
<|endoftext|>I believe his 'sister' was the will of the Demiurge, who had power over it's own creation (but didn't acknowledge its own creation).I dont' know if it was meant to be an actual sister, or if it was an anthropomorphism of the Demiurge's actions... I'd have to look into it more. If I have a different take i'll try to msg ya... 
<|endoftext|>Different Gnostics? You did mention the Nag Hamadi Library and while I haven't read it in its entirety (only really the Apocryphon of John and the Gospel of Thomas), I don't think any of the manuscripts talk about a narrative of psychic aliens and an otherworldly intelligence called Gaia. The Apocryphon of John is usually thought to be the most important Gnostic work as it occurs in nearly half of the codices found at Nag Hamadi, and the Gospel of Thomas is the oldest. From which of the Nag Hamadi books are you drawing this narrative?I have taken a great deal of LSD and some mushrooms, but never DMT. 
<|endoftext|>I think the names change but the archetype is eternal, and an impulse followed to resist that which is abhorrent is always a victory. Good on you. 
<|endoftext|>Thank you for the leads! I realize I may be succumbing to a false duality in retrospect. I've bookmarked Mr.Lash's site.May I ask- is there a "correct" deity in your opinion? I don't even know what to believe anymore.May I *create* a belief? I'm only asking your opinion of course. I know I can do what I want but... pls elaborate.Is the Judaic God simply a demiurge? I feel that term may be a corrosive meme. Or is it truth?
<|endoftext|>I agree. I think it's a cycle designed for the the utility of negative energy farming. We incarnate, we get traumas. They give us fears, emotional reactions to our experiences, even unconscious ones. That fear cuts us off from joy. It also makes us act out in poor ways. This can cause us to earn bad karma. Then after we die we are told we have bad karma and need to go back to life, knowing we will be traumatized, in order to pay off the karma. We reoffend and repeat over and over again.We are told we need contrast to even appreciate good at all as an explanation for why these useless eater beings exist, causing suffering and dysfunction. Yet, when we look at the best preexisting tests for this idea, the undeveloped, we see contradiction. Traumatized animals and children do not have greater happiness. They are plagued by negative emotion and lack of joy. They are damaged beings. The happiest ones have the best upbringings. Prisons are full of damaged people, not ecstatic experiencers of contrast. We are told that without the dark beings we would be stagnant, or too slow in developing. Yet, we have billions of years to evolve and a vast sea to evolve inside. We will discover new things and integrate them into our civilization. We don't need adversaries to evolve. Some that call themselves light sell these dark beings as a catalyst for our evolution. I wish they'd just get a room with that catalyst themselves. Then they could tell us how they liked it and I wouldn't be offended. Some of the light also says that without the dark influence, we wouldn't even have free will choice. They define it basically as being tempted to do wrong, causing a more interesting (for them) experiences to watch. Yet, we perceive that having a lack of this interference is more freedom than having it. We see free will choice as self-determination, not a balance of malevolent and benevolent influence. We enjoy having joy, peace, freedom and harmony. When we go to the movies to watch other people, like those who may be watching us, we want disharmony, conflict, struggles for freedom and troubled characters. Think about it. Our self-interests are opposed to those who would be watching us for entertainment, if they were like us.Beware that the light is the best place for the dark to hide, because it gives them great access to our trust and consent. Furthermore, if they can make us feel betrayed by the light, they not only get negative energy for it, but they cause us to be more separated from genuine benevolent beings by belief in their insidiousness. 
<|endoftext|>I'd like to know what you consider the most convincing evidence *for* your worldview (which I've come to know over the months that I've read your posts and comments on Reddit)? I've read a large number of NDE accounts, various channeled material, orthodox religious interpretations, and assorted other opinions. (Orthodox religious interpretations would be the least trustworthy for obvious reasons, but in the case of, e.g. Tibetan material, they do provide some relevant data in my opinion). While some of these sources do support your perspective (or close to it), most of them do not. In particular, a majority of NDE accounts seem to stress not only the positive nature of the experience, but a very deep *knowing* that seems to suggest great discernment and a deep level of "experiential" knowledge. Of course, they could all be being deceived, but on the other hand, so could you. I'm interested because obviously one wants to get it "right". If walking into the light is the same as walking into a trap, one would obviously not want to do that. But if you *don't* walk into the light, what happens to you then? I think this last question really needs to be answered if one is going to accept the idea that aliens use the white light to steal or recycle souls.I don't mean to be critical here, I really want to know what you think, since (in this sub anyway) you seem to be one of the most consistent and passionate advocates for your worldview.
<|endoftext|>I don't disagree, but I find your interpretation overly negative. This reality is a minimum security prison, but that's not necessarily bad. Prisons have a purpose. This one is a place to determine which parts get to return to "society" (heaven or god-source) and which parts need to go to maximum security (hell).We aren't discrete souls, we are scoops of soul soup that get mixed around in reincarnation. You can talk to other beings because we are all part of the same whole, ladled out. We keep getting ladled into this prison so the sorting algorithm can keep running.The Archons that run this process, while undeniably evil, are serving a purpose. They are the wardens of this prison and of the super-max of hell. I like to ignore them, do the work I'm here to do in this life, and I look forward to this whole thing getting done and going home.
<|endoftext|>You might never get to find out. A brief look at history will tell you so. Not at events but at the creation of certain aspects of humanity.What changes as you go across the world?Government. Religion. Currency. Language.The last one being the most important. Where did language come from? Search and search and you won't find an answer. You find that out... you crack the code. Forget the moon. Forget the Bermuda triangle. You can't even tell me who gave you the gift of speech. It was given to you, remember that.However they say the creation of language predates written word, so we'll never know who gave it to all of us.It's how we introduce every single human being into our societies. Language. Ever read those rare stories about "feral children" and how they have trouble adapting language and integrating into society?You can't even begin to imagine the mind-fuck it would be living in the wild, free from other human beings, and then coming into a society and seeing all the layers of history and creation of who? Man. All of a sudden, every aspect of your life is controlled and given to you by another human being? With zero agency? The first thing they'll teach a feral child is language, otherwise they won't be able to grasp government, currency, technology, etc.As human beings, we are animals. We deny this heavily, and bring it up only when we have to. We are human beings and we are animals. Just like the gorilla and the monkey and the rat. We are taught. We run through mazes, experience pain, learn behavioural patterns.The Bible fucks up and discredits itself in its very first book, Genesis. It says... God _spoke_ the universe into existence...Find where language comes from. I have no idea, but if you do, PM me and tell me.Where does language come from? Where oh where?
<|endoftext|>Sure, but at the deepest level of being, we are indestructible. Thus, the harm that "evil" may inflict is only "temporary" (properly understood outside of the concept of time, which is a property of our realm but not Ultimate Reality). So, yes, "you" can become overly fascinated with the physical realm, the astral realms (lower and upper), and play the game of Heaven and Hell for aeons if you like. But ultimately "evil" is a portion of the god-source, and must ultimately return to it. I am not denying the quarantine aspect of Hell, in fact I think it follows automatically and almost mechanically by virtue of the instantaneous nature of manifestation within the astral realm. There is no way for "good" and "evil" to mix in the astral realm because they would instantly sort themselves. However, the astral realm is ultimately also illusory, it's just the next level "up" in the order of Being.
<|endoftext|>who have encountered malevolent beings on DMTThey were more "annoyed" that I had the audacity to peer beyond the veil and accompanied me on my return. Most beings I've encountered are benevolent.
<|endoftext|>Except Hubbard decided to found Scientology on a wager with his friends on who could start a successful religion...
<|endoftext|>It's not well confirmed, but it seems to be a good indicator of where things are heading. If that is the plan, they seem to be doing a good job following it.
<|endoftext|> Sometimes I think to myself What if meditation is actually a ploy to stop people from actively participating and paying attention to how much their getting fucked over by a corrupt system that is slowly taking over? What if meditation/looking within, actually makes a person docile and inactive and has been promoted for this purpose? Slavoj Zizek discusses this at large. Here's a summary I found in [this article]( "Western Buddhism presents itself as a remedy against the stresses of modern life though, as Slavoj iek has noted, it actually functions as a perfect supplement to modern life. It allows adherents to decouple from the stress, whilst leaving the causes of the stress intact: consumptive forces continue unhindered along their creatively destructive path. In short, Buddhism is the new opium of the people."
<|endoftext|>Being a guide requires a compass and a map. Having a compass requires there to be a fixed set of principles upon which it works, where you can always find true north no matter what you're feeling. So to be your own guide requires you to be the one guided, the compass, the map, and the true north. This last, especially, is the problem with being your own guide. It actually leads to relativism rather than discovery of truth, if the true north is defined as being whatever you find when you look inside yourself. What you find there may not be the truth.Just my 2c.
<|endoftext|>Lol yeah I don't buy that shit. Looks like you're giving me two options. Be a slave to the archons who god made if he made everything. Or be a slave to God through some convoluted bullshit that involves human sacrifice. Has it ever occurred to you that Jesus Christ is Lucifer? And I always find it curious that people who claim to follow Jesus quote Paul who Jesus warned would come after him and was a wolf in sheeps clothing. 
<|endoftext|>Can we get an answer from the person that actually posted about the soul contracts and not the threads hijacker?
<|endoftext|>Never said contracts were bad. But generally speaking being deceived into a contract doesn't mean that it actually benefits me. Contracting with the government comes to mind here. It benefits them most of the time. I think having sex is one of the reasons I personally incarnate into this shit show over and over. But I think I'm done after this life. Not coming back. 
<|endoftext|>i think i agree with you about expanding and creating worlds of free expression. i disagree with your view on the sinister nature of religion (i think that's what you're getting at?). really, i think any "sinister" force is based on fear/ignorance.how do you believe we are to gain control of ourselves and stop dying?
<|endoftext|>I have read the article you linked years ago and it certainly influenced my previous post. "Tell the Lords of Karma that you are sovereign" is a must read for any beginner Gnostic.Also check "Tricked by the Light" as it goes hand in hand with "Lords of Karma."
<|endoftext|>Just food for thought. If god source split itself, I don't feel like all of those pieces are existing here on earth in the now... As a Mahayana buddhist, I believe there are many thousands or millions of worlds both similar and different from our own. Thus, we fractions of god-source here on earth do not add up to the whole of 1, all spirits on earth are more like .000001% of that god-source with worlds numerous both in this universe and in other dimensions.Basically one world in another dimension may be contracting to make up for an increase in individual souls here on earth. Each individual goes through birth and death, but so do civilizations and other worlds. Think bigger. What has been revealed is but a tiny glimpse of true knowledge. By the way, these Buddhist ideas are different from traditional Buddhism (Theravada). These ideas come mostly from the Lotus Sutra, considered scripture of the Buddha by Mahayana but not Theravada.
<|endoftext|>I've been a Christian. I was a slave to dogma. It made me fear the wrath of God. It made me fear questioning the faith. After I plowed through that fear and changed my beliefs and I no longer have the fear.I now know so much more about the attributes that come with slave seeking individuals. The God of the old testament is a slave seeker, no doubt about it. A slave seeker is the antithesis of the message of Jesus.Jesus would have us treat others the way we would want to be treated. Slave seekers want exactly the opposite. They want others to be their servants. No being that acts this way is worth interacting with. They usually deceive and undermine free will in order to achieve slavery for others and utility for the self. There are many beings like this that do it in a small way. They are like parasites, wanting others to carry a burden for them.I believe in a God and as I learn more about what he could be, the more I think I come to see things as he might. Know thyself. As you know more about yourself, you will know more about others. Understanding is an effective lubricant for forgiveness. It does wonders for me.As you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back into you. What does this mean? God is all things. As you seek God, God turns your mind inward, examining yourself. For you are God. God wants you to awaken to your truth and be your true self. God is also like a mirror, reflecting back in subtle ways that which is out of integrity with yourself and the whole. If you want to be a parasite, as I mentioned earlier, you will find yourself around other parasites that will treat you the way you treat others. If there were only a few individuals, this reflective property of existence would be obvious. The size of the container and the buffer of those who disagree with you shield you from a quicker reflection.With wisdom, there is no going back. 
<|endoftext|>Jesus is not God. He is a messenger of a way of life that supports life and consciousness that came to an environment owned by anti-life, self-serving, self-superior, soul sucking abominations that in the modern day we call reptilians, but back then we called demons.The reptilians want to teach us to be just like them, so that we can become their slaves. Their self-serving way of life is predictable. Seek gain, avoid loss and calculate risk without letting concern for others get in the way of personal advantage. So more intelligent beings on this path can easily control less intelligent beings on the same path, with rewards and punishments. These beings are owned by a combination of technology and parasitic life, working as a hive, to create a vortex of value feeding the hive and its top leadership. They are the ultimate useless eaters. You could call the hive mind and its top leadership Satan if you want. Yet, you're better off knowing more of what they really are than having some kind of mystical fear. They are what would happen to us if we let psychopaths rule us into the ground. They will abuse technology to control us and use fear to control us. They will no doubt delve into mind control and other free will subverting activities. Eventually, the race will bend to their will, accepting instructions from the technology and become very much like this hive of reptiles. They want us to do this and then they'll just hack and hijack it, adding us as slaves. They feed on fear and suffering, because they absorb the energy of joy that others give off in negative emotional states. They look fearsome and disgusting, because then they can just be present and cause their hosts to immediately start radiating this energy. They evolve to be energy thieves essentially and when they have complete free reign, they often create environments that resemble hell, with torture and gore. It's like nose candy to a coke head for them. It's even more like sucking blood. One gets weaker while the other gets stronger. They are below worthless parasites. A rock or a pile of feces has more ultimate value for consciousness, if you think about it.  
<|endoftext|>Thank you.Doesn't this say that God was only upset He had destroyed other living beings due to man's actions? But the punishment towards man was still just?
<|endoftext|>Bad news, the guys pushing the NWO are kid fucking Satanist demons, so it's unlikely they're shooting for Heaven on earth. I think he's saying we need to stop them.
<|endoftext|>The time between the eclipse August 21 and the celestial alignment September 23 are of great interest to many people.
<|endoftext|>Killed? By whom? Now I this is off topic but surely you dont believe that BS? Anyway let us return to the main topic which is very interesting 
<|endoftext|>Have you looked into Valentinus? How can a man be Gnostic and almost be pope? A knowledge system is defined by the times. What is Truth becomes heresy. The message however, remains True. Truth does not change.
<|endoftext|>This. Those who live life focused on service of others will probably end up becoming Boddhisatvas and either sacrifice themselves, as you stated, or come back to Earth to liberate others. 
<|endoftext|>This is EXACTLY how my thought process worked. I reverse engineered the situation to find the truth. Look at what the evil elite are censoring the most and there is your truth. 
<|endoftext|>This is what did it for me. They didn't build a 40 foot owl statue at Bohemian Grove, just for fun. They didn't build a child rape island with an owl temple in the Caribbean for fun. They didn't kill 3 thousand people on Jesus' birthday, 9/11, just for fun. They didn't build a sculpture of Jesus in a nuclear explosion in the papal auditorium for fun.Our world is run by Satanists and demons. For now.
<|endoftext|> Skepticism was what originally led me to Christianity.I've heard this a lot, even my own pastor. Isn't it funny how when people genuinely try to disprove the Bible, they often end up realizing that it is actually the perfect inerant Word of God, just as it says it is? The Bible has stood the test of time, and does not cave under enormous pressure like other religious books do. Like you, I believe I have been (still am) supernaturally lead to discover hidden truths in this world. It should be fairly evident to anyone on this sub that the rulers of this world are literal satanists whom are beyond wicked. If you come to the conclusion there is true diabolical Evil in this world (and unseen forces behind it), then you can't help but ask what the other side is. Sometimes first finding the darkness will lead you to the light. I learn the HARD way, so it's not terribly surprising.**In the lies, you can find the truth. With the truth, you can see all the lies.**
<|endoftext|>Interesting! Thanks for the reply. Could you speak more to your feeling of the suppression of Christianity? Not sure if your American, but I've always felt like the prevalence of Christian morality (specifically puritanical morality) in our government and in our society is one of the biggest blights on the American people. Once again, we've just used similar paths to arrive to very different conclusions, and I think this is super interesting. 
<|endoftext|> those with real power in this world are 100% involved in the occultPlease don't downvote me for asking this, but can you provide any sources or evidence of this?
<|endoftext|>as a Christian, (also) I can say that I respectfully disagree with the majority of your statements. I personally view the old testament as a reference and nothing more (other than the 10 commandments). The world was a VERY different place back then and different spiritual laws applied.The OT has incredible amounts of truth that are still just as valid today as they were back then, particularly if you choose to ask the Lord for wisdom about prophecy. You will be taken on a ride ALL over the Bible, and find verses that you didn't even know existed that have profound meaning to this day. His Word is timeless. That being said, I understand it is a Book of so many layers, connections, cross-references, puzzle pieces and encrypted information (purposefully) it staggers the mind when you begin to see them. Supernatural and divine origin becomes the only plausible, rational and logical explanation (not to mention the supernatural experiences that come with it when the reality around you begins to change accordingly to earnest prayer requests being answered according to His will at His time)Ironically the truth is even the 10 commandments are done away with the Mosaic law, (including the 4th commandment & observing the Sabbath) and have been replaced with the New Covenant of Jesus Christ that believers today are under. There are only TWO laws:**1) Love God.** **2) Love others.** (*paraphrasing*)IF you keep the second law, you CANNOT break the 10 commandments. You cannot Love & Murder someone simultaneously, now can you? Same for stealing, adultery, etc. The Mosaic law existed for a purpose, and created a Covenant people through whom Jesus and his pure bloodline is traced perfectly (God ensured he was not part of the serpent seed genetic line, since Jesus had to remain sinless, and perfectly pure and adhere to the Mosaic law 100% in order to fill the requirement of the Law, in order to do away with it and open the doors to all people solely through Faith, and Faith alone. 9 out of the 10 commandments are also repeated throughout the New Testament as well, except for the 4th. the Bible is 2000 years oldThat would be the New Testament. The Bible as a whole is more like 3,500 years old, and written/compiled over 1,500 years through 40+ different authors (keep in mind ALL were divinely inspired, and every original word is the Word of God). The authors of the books/letters still retained their own unique personalities and writing styles which you can see throughout.
<|endoftext|>*None* of that shit makes sense. Anyone with even a basic understanding of how logic works can see that the Bible is nonsense. It's a tool for control and nothing else. I can't believe how many people here believe in this shit when religion is literally the oldest fucking conspiracy ever lol. 
<|endoftext|> That is the same problem I had with the God of the old testament - what kind of God wants blood sacrifices of his own people?He never asked for sacrifices of His own people, that is the devil whom deceives fools into sacrificing themselves or their children. The blood sacrifices were of ANIMALS to atone for the sin of His people. The wages of SIN is death. Period. Something MUST die, be it animal, human, or God Himself who manifested Himself as Jesus to provide the final, ultimate perfect sacrifice so that the old sacrificial system could be done away with once and for all. Did you ever wonder why God would need to sacrifice his only son (Jesus) to himself in order to forgive our sins? That doesn't really make a lot of senseIt begins to make perfect sense when you understand that there is DIVINE LAW in existence, that God Himself made. He WILL NOT break His OWN LAW!! Therefore he did what was necessary in order to fulfill the own law and provided a PERFECT final blood sacrifice of Himself as Jesus. Jesus Christ **IS** God, they are the same. Jesus is Yahweh/Jehovah. Christ is a title, not a name. Same as Messiah.Along with divine law, there are structures of things in place that must be adhered to in order for certain possibilities to remain true. For instance, you cannot have true, genuine LOVE, without FREE WILL. Love must be a choice the person makes, NOT through forced submission or conformity. God has no interest in puppets on a string, or "cookie-cutter" Christians. Individuality is huge to Him and is valued greatly.God wants those whom truly, genuienly Love Him and want to spend eternity with Him, the Creator of everything seen and unseen in our universe, and everything beyond it. If you don't want to live forever in an absolute paradise that is unfathomable to our pathetic little minds, that is indeed your choice. Actually it is the default choice. Contrary to what many will say, there are only TWO paths. Up or Down. That's it. Only two. There are NOT many ways to God or Heaven. There is ONE and ONE only, through Faith in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice and His ressurection from the dead that awaits all of us whom have humbled ourselves, admitted ourselves as sinners, and asked for forgiveness. If you don't want eternal life with the God of the Bible... well then He will grant you that wish too. The thing is, when you finally realize that it was a mistake, it will be too late by then. You will forever be spiritually seperated from God, for without Him, nothing can exist. In other words, you will simply be deleted and it will be as if you never existed, and no one will remember you or your name (after the punishment in Hell for your crimes is fulfilled, that is. Hell is a TEMPORARY place that is a prison for spirits, think of it as a jail for criminals to serve their time in, only ramped up to x1000 and full of demonic spirits that ABSOLUTELY LOATHE AND HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT HUMANS. Soon Hell, along with Death will be done away with for all eternity.)**OR** you can be "Saved" through Salvation from the Faith in Jesus Christ brings. All your sins (crimes) will be cast away, all past, present and even future that you haven't even committed yet. (God is outside of time, created it actually, and already knows exactly everything you are going to do. Having knowledge of what someone WILL do, does not take away from the fact that they had the FREE WILL to do it in the first place). Again, the choice is ours. Each of us must choose, but time is indeed running out . . .
<|endoftext|>I generally agree with this, but we're not completely cut off. You can still connect. It's just hard, although people are waking up. 
<|endoftext|>No problem. I belong to Sumafi. I align most with Sumari. To me , just from gathering information from how and what you posted, I feel you belong Tumold and you align Sumafi.
<|endoftext|>Because the Bible was written by ancient racists with esoteric knowledge for sheep. That's why it's so insistent you stfu and suck god's dick and question nothing. The keys to understanding Proto-Indo-European cosmology and its mysteries don't require you to believe any of the Anunnaki nonsense you read in the Bible. Yahweh is a fraud and his book was written by frauds.
<|endoftext|>A lot of people have different beliefs about Jesus. That's mine. It makes the most sense, IMO. Do you really think he had "magic God powers"?Also, look up John Allegro. There is scholarly evidence that the Bible is referring to Jesus being a mushroom. I think the texts alternate back and forth between Jesus being the mushroom, and Jesus being a guy handing out mushrooms.
<|endoftext|>Since we are in this universe, we see things close to god as good, and far away as bad, but is it because we are trapped or that's how it's supposed to be?
<|endoftext|>Generally accepted amongst people who subscribe to gnosticism for sure. There are far more people in the Abrahamic religions
<|endoftext|>haha. i find it amusing that my posts immediately get downvoted. sorry to break it to the "Archons" and the human sellouts that serve them: In your relentless need to enslave, you have awoken a group of great beings with limitless potential !
<|endoftext|>Is there a way to save them? May I ask what you've been doing to try? I hope it works out for you, Astral. Hang in there. 
<|endoftext|>The creator made us in his image. He's not 100% our enemy, but like people, he can be friend, enemy, or something in between.
<|endoftext|>Can you go into more detail on that? What do you see? And how do you get there? And where and how did you find out how to get there?
<|endoftext|>I was always under the impression that it was Julius Cesar or the Muslim conquest that destroyed the Library at Alexandria. One of the other theories is about Pope Theophilus of Alexandria. But he was *not* Catholic. He was a pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church which is again, not Catholic. 
<|endoftext|>Not really. They all *claim* to serve the same God. But they hold irreconcilable worldviews.For example, Islam and Judaism are unitarian while most christians are trinitarians. Islam teaches salvation tru obedience of Law. Judaism doesn't have the concept of Salvation. Christianity teaches salvation comes tru faith..Just to mention a few..
<|endoftext|>Uh, Islam is probably the least relevant thing to Gnosticism. Islam was founded roughly six hundred years after Christianity and a LONG time after Judaism. Gnosticism was (barely) active for maybe 100 or 150 years during the early period of Christianity (commonly 30AD to 325AD) and after that was pretty much forgotten until its modern discovery a hundred years or so ago. By the time Islam was around Gnosticism had already come, gone, and been forgotten. It is not relevant at all. Muslim scholars wouldn't have even known what Gnosticism was and even if they had would have abhorred it as they did all forms of mysticism.
<|endoftext|>No. As they worshipped a man who died and came back to life. Some gnostic texts reference christ being pure light and not a human... So essentially christianity warped the true story and created something evil. Every church has a cross which they kill christ on...The church isn't a building of stone were people pray in public.. Even early references to christ around his time mention him as an old man. 
<|endoftext|>There are many interpretations of Gnosticism. Some are more mythological and literal, like Sophia sinning by disobeying God and Demiurge being the product of that. But metaphorically its more like Sophia is a phenomenon, which, as it interacts with other aspects of God in certain ways, produces the material world. That's just how I interpret it.
<|endoftext|>Look up Philo of Alexandria and Logos. This was pre Christian Jews and also non-Jew Greeks speculating about the "son of god".
<|endoftext|>The son sounds like Adam. In Genesis, the creator creates earth and then creates the first being in his own image, to rule over the earth. This means that man was created in the image of the Demiurge, which is close enough to being his son. This is backed up by the way that "in his image" is immediately followed by stating that man is to rule over the physical world, just like the Demiurge. The son being shown Sophia's light is the same as Adam eating from the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.The son becomes aware of his father's origin after he is enlightened by Sophia, and the Demiurge also becomes very jealous of his son and starts attacking him; Adam becomes aware of the Evil in the creator's world, and the creator subsequently kicks Adam out and starts punishing mankind.
<|endoftext|> I don't think any of the manuscripts talk about a narrative of psychic aliens and an otherworldly intelligence called Gaia. I highly recommend reading, On the Origin of the World and The Hypostasis of the Archons. There are several translations here;  texts go into detail about the aborted shadow-mass, the Demiurge, his creations (the Archons, "described as soulless beings or astral-mental parasites that "exaggerate human error and intrude upon humanity by psychic stealth in order to propagate the ideological virus of redemptive religion.") and much more.Not many are mentioning in Not in His Image, the concept of 'redemptive religion' as a virus. He makes lots of good points.
<|endoftext|>Isn't there a whole book about the Sophia mythology? Lash dissects it in his book, and there are YouTube videos, etc....Sorry for the slow response, but I'm very interested in this subject.
<|endoftext|>I think we should work with psychedelics, have authentic spiritual experiences, and search for the truth ourselves. Of course, there's a truth out there, and I think the Gnostic material is really interesting to consider, not necessarily accept. I think we live in a universe teeming with intelligence, some with very divine intention, some with very evil intention, and some that may not be easily categorized as good or evil. Remote viewing seems to be real, and there are clearly many dimensions, so the forces we're dealing with may or may not be terrestrial.I'm glad this conversation is going on. 
<|endoftext|> I think it's a cycle designed for the the utility of negative energy farming.Why would such a process exist? Why would energy vampires exist? Why would someone create such a thing?What if these archons, despite being evil, serve a purpose? They were created to take all the negativity, evil, fear, pain, and they eat it up, suck it up like a karmic vacuum cleaner. Then they keep it bagged up (hell) so that the evil "dirt" isn't littered all over.I'm not saying to sympathize. They are evil. But I don't hate them, because they feed on and are hate. I don't want to feed or emulate them. But they will do their job, and I will do mine.
<|endoftext|>If you don't walk into the light, what can possibly happen to you? Something bad? Why would something bad happen to a divine being, an innocent soul? I think the only reason something like that would scare someone is because they do not trust in themselves. Zen masters urged people to completely trust in themselves. Autonomy. Our experiences on Earth make us think we must trust in something other than ourselves. Think about it.
<|endoftext|>Although I feel that 99% of NDE are B.S. propaganda and advertising to deceive humanity. Here is one very interesting NDE. The man dies and two non physical humans desperately try to save him from the White Light Trap. He leaves them and goes upwards and ends up in a room with 12 robed beings who are by their description certainly sound like aliens. 
<|endoftext|>The problem is you do not finish and "go home". You get your Memory Erased and are Forced To Reincarnate over and over. It never ends. This simulation serves no purpose other than the ability of Parasitic Aliens to harvest loosh energy. Does a cow want to be kept in a pen for a few years and then be brutally slaughtered, over and over into infinity? Is that cow "balancing karma" and "learning lessons"? No. Is the cow allowed to educate itself and live in peace? Is the cow allowed to explore and create other realms? Is the cow allowed to keep its knowledge and memories to develop as an eternal expanding being? The cow is being used as a harvested resource and nothing more. The cow is the same as the "goyim". Humanity is seen as cattle and nothing more...
<|endoftext|>How does "the Bible eff up" in that regard. I'm of the belief science and religion aren't separate but can run concurrent to each other. Even if you are atheist though I don't get how God speaking earth into existence is a contradiction? 
<|endoftext|>I kind of get this with Salvia. They are more annoyed with my clinging to my programming than having slipped through. I don't consider them malevolent though. 
<|endoftext|>Well the most successful religion, id hope, stems from universal and/or historical truths.Theres also the possibility this is hearsay (or plain disinformation) although ive no evidence either way. Sounds like its not on any official record, but correct me if im wrong.Note im not a proponent of scientism, just sensitive to anything that seems smeared by the mainstream lately.
<|endoftext|> Being a guide requires a compass and a map. Having a compass requires there to be a fixed set of principles upon which it works, where you can always find true north no matter what you're feeling. So to be your own guide requires you to be the one guided, the compass, the map, and the true north. This last, especially, is the problem with being your own guide. It actually leads to relativism rather than discovery of truth, if the true north is defined as being whatever you find when you look inside yourself. What you find there may not be the truth. Just my 2c.What is truth north to you? And what is it that decides if it has found it or not?Does not the recognition of true north come from within? For example, does 2+2 = 4 because you were told it does, or was there some point where you got it, a realization that occurred in which the truth suddenly became self-evident? Looking within is arguable one of the most ambiguous statements of all time, and is ripe for misunderstanding.  I can only defend what I mean by looking within and being my own guide, and what I mean is using your own intuitive sense of what is true by examining closely all phenomena that arises in the mind objectively. What I certainly dont mean is that whatever you find when you look inside yourself is true. In fact, at least in the Vipassana tradition, it is precisely the opposite. By looking inside you see how temporary and impermanent so much of the phenomena we have come to think of as true really are (i.e., thoughts, emotions, sensations, etc.,), and that there is much more going on on a very subtle level, the experience of which forces us to expand our understanding of what we truly are and what we can experience. But at the end of the day this is all just words. Realization of truth isnt words, its intuition, and it comes from within.At least that is how it appears to me. I speak of course form my current level of ignorance. 
<|endoftext|>Shrug. I have studied gnosticism. I've read the gnostic gospels--the gospel of thomas, judas etc. I've studied and read greek. I've talked, studied and been throughout the middle east learning religion. I've done drugs and experimented. I'm in seminary. I know my shit. Be a slave to the archons who god made if he made everything. Or be a slave to God through some convoluted bullshit that involves human sacrifice.Slave? No. Servant? Yes. I choose to be a servant to God because I have experienced God/a presence/being that has changed me and made me better. I am a nicer, kinder, more patient, more generous, humble and peaceable person because I know Jesus and Jesus is my friend. I love Jesus with all my heart. Reading the gnostics and finding out "secret knowledge" doesn't help me. Gnosticism says that you will know if it's true or not, after you die but Gnosticism doesn't help me TODAY. Jesus does. Knowing Mohammad hasn't change me like that. When I pray to "Allah" described in the Qur'an, the "god" presence feels "real" but far off. When I pray to Jesus/Yeshua/Iesso/Hesus" the God that was far off becomes near.Or be a slave to God through some convoluted bullshit that involves human sacrifice.You're looking at it like God sacrificing a human. It's the other way around. God allows humanity to kill (sacrifice) God. This breaks the system and provides a way out. 
<|endoftext|>Christianity has many gods, but focuses on 3.* God the father: demiurge, creator god, both good and bad.* God the son: Jesus, an example that all people are derived from and part of god-source.* God the holy spirit: the god-source from which all demi-gods, people, matter, energy, and thought derive. Infinite, which means infinitely good and infinitely bad.God-source created "god" (demiurge, creator god, Yahweh) to manage this little sorting algorithm we live in. God-source created the archons to be like wardens, finding evil, pain, and fear, and throwing it into prison (hell).Once the sorting is done, hell gets to go be hell in quarantine, and the rest of us return to god-source. We're not slaves, we're experiencing the sorting algorithm so we can go back to what we really are, but with good and evil separated. 
<|endoftext|>I thought about this too. If JC is almighty then he should be able to off Lucifer.. Unless Lucifer is also God or working with....
<|endoftext|>To be fair, Christ was not Lucifer. Lucifer had control of the temples, and has control of Christianity. In church, most of Christ's teachings are brushed aside to make way for the words of his disciples.
<|endoftext|> "In order to cancel your contract with 'Pepsi', you must make a contract with 'Coke'. "The metaphor works better if Coke was more powerful than the multiverses while Pepsi only had normative extra-dimensional abilities. You don't have to do anything I say or what anybody else says--God/gods/powers whatever. You CAN have it your way. Literally.I'm just sharing what I've found in pursuing and experiencing freedom. 
<|endoftext|>all religion and any system of "hierachy" is essentially "archonic". they manipulate both sides, "sinister" and what on the outside appears to be "good". we must understand that "THOUGHT" is the ultimate force above all. thought slows down to create "energy". energy slows down to create the illusion of "matter". sickness and death are not our nature. they are matrix programs written by satanic aliens known as "ARCHONS". the greatest skill and ability in a so called "physical reality" is VISUALIZATION. if you can, practice seeing objects and events in your "minds eye" as well as with open eyes. become an expert. become a master of "visualization". humanity became lazy and massively atrophied. the matrix projected scenes for us. unfortunately these became scenes of poverty, sickness and death. we can and will change this. you have the unlimited ability to SELF PROJECT worlds of pure beauty and kindness...
<|endoftext|>I agree, I love that this idea is happening. I don't understand at all why people think this idea would kill this sub. I'm loving this
<|endoftext|>Thanks that is an excellent website with great information. You may also find this article interesting. "Aliens That Appear As False Light Beings":
<|endoftext|>Mahayana buddhist here... I have the "Tibetan book of the dead" at home, admittedly I haven't read it cover to cover, but I feel I can explain some things...My understanding is that for a month or 40 days after death, you go through a specific variety of realms or experiences upon death, I don't remember most of them but the idea is that they are drastically different from one another, a few repeat similar concepts like you go through a smoky realm and a clear realm and a realm of no visibility at all and stuff like that. You will visit hell like realms and heaven like realms but all that you experience should be considered a test of sorts.You are not supposed to become attached or caught up in any of these realms, that is the truth no matter which one you are in. Various beings or guardian spirits will tempt you in many ways with riches, with false promises of enlightenment, in some experiences the being will be wrathful and threatening and the main point is that all these guardians are trying to lure you, trick you, give you delusions and confuse you from true enlightenment.Also I remember that you will be tempted, and led into confusion by your 6 senses and that all you experience should be thought of like an illusion. Another main point that's interesting, your sense of time will not be the same at all. Even though all these experiences take place in the span of around 40 days, some experiences or realms will feel like you have been there for thousands of years. Surprise! So overall it's very confusing, but Tibetan Buddhism suggests that you should not believe any of it, don't get attached to anything and follow the teachings to cut out delusions and avoid becoming trapped in one of these realms. The Tibetan science of death makes sense in many ways, perhaps we are in a complex farm or soul trap of sorts, but basically everything you experience will be pretty unpredictable after death and with the difference in time-frame and numerous different experiences and it's not surprising that these things lead us into confusion and result in not remembering our previous life and experiences when we reincarnate.I can look over my book tonight and I have been wanting to post more about this topic and my experiences. 
<|endoftext|> Do the elite bloodlines have a trick that retains spiritual memoryI remember reading somewhere that ancient Egyptian Priests were able to identify when/whom they would reincarnate into (with intent). 
<|endoftext|>If you read the original PIE (closer to age of the Anunnaki and Igigi) myths of the serpent and the tree, you realize knowledge is the fruit of the tree of life, and the serpent *guards* it and eats it for himself, he doesn't entice men toward it.The Hebrew myths are a bastardization written for sheep to keep them from realizing the truth. PIE language and religion scattered the world as the false gods subverted our attempts to understand our true divine nature. This is the real Tower of Babel, and why basically all IE cosmologies point to the same truth.
<|endoftext|>I feel like true enlightenment takes a lot of time and lifetimes of practice in general, but that rewards for following the Buddhist path will be substantially beyond our expectations in the long run.Being a bodhisattva is the highest form of the path from my perspective and will lead to swift enlightenment in a fraction of the lifetimes or in just one. Teaching others how to find happiness is true Buddhism. 
<|endoftext|>Me as well. The only reason I did not succumb to atheism was that I saw the great works of evil done by our elites and saw the mark of the Devil behind them.That alone can fuel a faith. 
<|endoftext|>Ive heard 12-25 isnt actually Jesus' birthday but how do you know it was actually 9-11? Genuinely curious, thank you in advance.
<|endoftext|> Isn't it funny how when people genuinely try to disprove the Bible, they often end up realizing that it is actually the perfect inerant Word of God, just as it says it is? The Bible has stood the test of time, and does not cave under enormous pressure like other religious books do. The bible has been heavily edited, over millennia, by pagans, satanists, and kid fucking priests. It talks about human and animal sacrifice (Abraham's son and Jezebel's sacrifice to Yahweh and Ba'al). The old testament god refers to himself as a jealous god. It says you will go to hell for wearing blended clothing (60/40 non-iron shirts), getting a tattoo, or eating a bacon cheeseburger.There's a reason Jesus created a new covenant and said to disregard the old testament. But there's a lot of stuff that was added or removed from the new testament as well, again because of those priests that like little boys.When wondering whether I am duty bound to stone a divorced woman for being an adulterer per Yahweh or should instead let someone without sin cast the first stone, I see that the Bible is absolutely wrong in some areas, because it can't even agree with itself. More specifically, there are many different gods (Yahweh, Ba'al, Jesus, Molech) described within.
<|endoftext|>Funny how people in the conspiracy sub believe religious bullshit, when religion is literally the oldest conspiracy there is. Religion was created to control people through fear. The Bible is so logically inconsistent it's amazing anyone could believe it. 
<|endoftext|>Virtually everything bad about Christianity is from the old testament or pagan traditions. Christianity should be about Jesus Christ and loving each other. "Christians" who focus on hating gays and the poor are frauds.The neocons who pretend to be Christian and advanced all these concepts are Satanists.
<|endoftext|>I'm interested in your thoughts on the suppression of Christianity as well. And if you see the elite tied to dark (imo this is the easy part), why/what *specifically* made you think Christianity itself was the light? Why not Buddhism or Islam? I'm admittedly heavily biased against the machinations of all Abrahamic religions because of reasons similar to noservant but fascinating shit like this requires an open mind
<|endoftext|>This is a religious thread, there won't be a speck of physical evidence for anything being claimed.
<|endoftext|>This guy dabbles in it I believe. I watched it a while ago, should be talking about elite, satanic rituals, etc.  forgot to add source 
<|endoftext|>I second that.My comprehension is that the moral laws had not changed, since God's nature is out of time/eternal. But the ritualistic laws are to be put in context and thus not applied to everyone /everywhere/anytime.
<|endoftext|> The Mosaic law existed for a purpose, and created a Covenant people through whom Jesus and his pure bloodline is traced perfectly (God ensured he was not part of the serpent seed genetic line, since Jesus had to remain sinless, and perfectly pure and adhere to the Mosaic law 100% in order to fill the requirement of the LawCan you specify or expand on this? After the flood only Noah and his sons remained. Where or what is the serpent's seed? Are there any books that you can recommend that will give context to the Bible? Especially for anyone starting out?
<|endoftext|>Don't spout your superstitions as facts. Jesus was never so close-minded. Sounds like you worship the yadabolath of the old testament. 
<|endoftext|> Jesus is YahwehJesus is god the son. Yahweh is god the father. They are separate. They are both part of god the holy spirit.Yahweh said to stone adulterers. Jesus said he without sin should cast the first stone.
<|endoftext|>Why does a completely omnipotent being need a sacrifice?? He's literally supposed to be the creator of everything and all powerful but he needs all this pointless shit to happen to "save" us? Come on man. And you keep begging the question. When we're debating whether or not religion is legit, you can't use "divine law and structures" as an argument to support your view. Because that's literally the thing being debated. You're already presupposing the existence of all these religious ideas by using them as justification for shit not adding up. Logic doesn't work that way. 
<|endoftext|> In other words, *you will simply be deleted and it will be as if you never existed*, and no one will remember you or your name (after the punishment in Hell for your crimes is fulfilled, that is. Hell is a TEMPORARY place that is a prison for spirits, think of it as a jail for criminals to serve their time in, only ramped up to x1000 and full of demonic spirits that ABSOLUTELY LOATHE AND HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT HUMANS. Soon Hell, along with Death will be done away with for all eternity.)This doesn't sound right. Judge yourself: Rev. 20:10 ... cast into the lake of fire ... and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  Rev. 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
<|endoftext|>I went to Catholic school for over a decade, and I am only posing questions about the teachings of my own religion. Don't assume what I do or don't take literally. I am questioning a dogma here. Do you have an answer or just a suggestion for my life? Peace
<|endoftext|>Agree. I have met the god-source. If the Archons are trying to stop that, they're doing a really shitty job.
<|endoftext|>We choose to think of god as good, but god is everything, including evil. God is only good is generally wishful thinking. Look for gods that are good... Jesus is a good example.
<|endoftext|>Christian God the Father = Old Testament god = Yahweh = Demiurge = creator godChristians follow Jesus Christ (hence the name) but also recognize Yahweh and god the holy spirit (god-source, real god) as the trinity.
<|endoftext|>archons... are cons! lol. How can one free themselves of soul contracts? Are archons able to attack someone spiritually and torture them greatly?
<|endoftext|>I am trying to teach them the process of how to "Remove Soul Contracts". This is very difficult because of many reasons. First you have to get into the Astral Afterlife and be able to stay there for an extended period. The Archons have a very large number of actual deceased humans who eagerly work for them. These people have many roles from the numerous counselors (really mind programmers) to full fledged security and law enforcement types who are extremely close minded and violent towards those who do not fully go with the program. Many people have very vivid dreams of the large university type buildings that are all over the Astral Afterlife. These buildings are what David Icke calls the "Halls Of Programming'. I have been in many of them. The "Counselors" are constantly inside the lecture halls with the deceased targets. Constantly saturating their minds with the falsehood that the hardships they endured were part of the "lessons" and the earth is a "school". The targeted person is fed this propaganda non stop for many years. They are taught to distrust and report on living humans who cross over. People who are caught speaking with a living human are severely punished and made an example of. The Archon Hierachy will do anything to keep both sides of humanity uninformed and to maintain this system of enslavement.
<|endoftext|>Because Satan, the fallen angels, and the most depraved of this world know they're going to the pool of fire for eternity and they don't want to be lonely, so they will make everyone follow their ways as much as possible so they can increase the numbers that will be going to hell. 
<|endoftext|>A combination of mostly Astral Projection, some Advanced Lucid Dreaming and the use of various rotating supplements. Galantamine with Choline and Melatonin, Magnesium, Wheat Grass Tablets, Kelp, Gotu Kola etc.. I have never used DMT. Although years ago I had a Salvia Divornum experience that seems very similar to what DMT users experience. I saw the colors, geometric shapes and machine elves. I feel this is a completely different experience that is not connected to the Archons or the Astral Afterlife.
<|endoftext|>Most likely DMT or past life regression hypnosis are the most common ways to meet beings on the other side. I say "beings" because they are not human.
<|endoftext|>The Astral Afterlife looks just like here. Houses, bars and restaurants. Food tastes like food. people indulge in "romantic relations". The major difference is that objects can be moved by thought. Although it seems to be very illegal to do so in that dimension. The afterlife is in a martial law type of scenario. There is actually much less freedom throughout the afterlife than here. Deceased people attend regular seminars to discuss their previous life. (this is actually major programming and mind control) the deceased humans are strung along and made to feel bad about themselves. all of this being a set up by the humans who work for the archons. after many years of being fed complete propaganda the human is then Forced To Reincarnate.
<|endoftext|>Where in my comment do I compare Gnosticism and Islam?Nowhere...Please read my comment fully before replying. I merely am drawing a circle around the three religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) as all deriving from the Abrahamic tradition.Your comment as a seperate piece of dialogue is very intriguing, however. I agree that Islam would have found Gnosticism abhorrent; they currently do, anyways.
<|endoftext|>A lot of original church teachings/concepts were just bastardized neo-platonic ideals crammed into Paul's ideology. 
<|endoftext|>Demi-gods, devils, angels. The Greeks call one Jupiter, the Romans call presumably the same entity Zeus, Jews call it Ba'al. All are presumably the same thing under different names to different peoples.
<|endoftext|>i think it's wrong to label them as evil? i mean the plane we are on experiences both contractive and expansive energies, whereas there are places/planets/other planes that are solely contractive or expansive. the positive will see the negative as evil and the negative will see the positive as evil, especially when forcefully imposed on the other. if that makes sense.without positive and negative energies i think there wouldn't be much balance, especially where we humans reside.i think why we might perceive certain entities or things as evil is because we go in with already preconceived notions of what is "scary/unsettling" so that feeling might warrant a response that is undesireable. not leaving room for acceptance of them. traversing those places needs us to be accepting without judgement so as to understand them better, i believe.
<|endoftext|>Well in most NDE accounts, the dying person is utterly at peace, without any fear, and feels an unequivocally loving presence. If they are trusting themselves -- and most of them do -- then there is nothing to fear about walking *into* the light. The perspective of astralrocker2001 is that the light is a trap, i.e. his version instills a great deal of fear in comparison to the typical account. His version is at odds with the majority, and also much darker, and much more likely to sow fear and doubt. That's why I'm asking. I'm not utterly discounting it, but I'd like to know what he thinks the alternatives are.
<|endoftext|> Why would something bad happen to a divine beingThe problem with being divine is that you're also infinite. The problem with being infinite is you have to be everything, both infinitely good and infinitely evil. 
<|endoftext|>I appreciate the link. In reading it, it seems that Brian's interpretation is different from yours. Although the "aliens" certainly seem to be non-human, his experience of them was that they were full of love and understanding. And, in fact, he hints that the desperate humans at the beginning were "stuck": So, now you are out of your body you may look down and see your body. You may take off for another room or zip back into your body. You may go into the void. This is the home of many a grim story. See, after death you may end up quite stuck in this void. It lacks one thing: love. It is the hell the Pope just figured out. It is not being of love, not recognizing it. Those who are stuck there may frighten you by just being or by intentional gestures to frighten you. They are stuck and they are confused and they will put the "HELL" in hell. My sense of NDEs is that most of the people who go through them experience a profoundly loving presence, and they are pretty certain of their experience and feelings. If we can't trust them, if indeed they cannot even trust themselves, then what *can* we trust? It seems like there is no capacity then for human discernment whatsoever, and that everything is ultimately pointless, even the experience of being human. I don't believe that, so I have a hard time discounting what 99% of NDEs are telling us about the experience of death.
<|endoftext|>Why is loosh (pain and fear and evil) a food source? Why would a creature exist (have been created) to feed on something like that?I assume you think that if you resist the light after death, and don't reincarnate, you will be able to return to your true self, outside the matrix. That's what I mean by returning home.
<|endoftext|>Still nothing. No one really has a concrete answer that I've found. The online journals and "scholars" won't give you anything that's conclusive.
<|endoftext|>WTAF? I had no idea. Its Everywhere! That's what I love about this sub. I am regularly humbled by my lack of knowledge, and I love to learn.
<|endoftext|>Sasha was a wizard if ever there was one. I actually hadn't realized he had died until I went to look him up. 2014 it seems. 
<|endoftext|>I had very interesting experiences on LSD and shrooms. I definitely felt as though I was seeing reality transformed at one point, something sinister. And another time I felt as though I was seeing beyond reality... Does this makes sense to anyone?Edit: spelling and grammar
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the clarification. I guess part of my question is - is that recognition of truth you get from within something that is actually *inside of you*, properly yours? Or are you able to tune into something greater, through which you're able receive that feeling of truth? So the question you posed to me is the one I'm posing to you. Are the tools of recognizing truth inherently inside you and you have to just use them, or are they external to you and really are a fixed compass that you can rely on as not being transitory or changeable as you are?
<|endoftext|>Interesting. As a Christian, I believe Gnosticism IS Luciferianism. From what I know of occultism, the plot is that we are trapped in a reincarnation circle so the way to break free is to gain "gnosis" through spiritual practices that eventually lead to being in contact or posessed by demonic entities and damning your soul for eternity.I think it is one big lie that God expressly warned and forbid us from many many times in the scriptures.What is your take on this? 
<|endoftext|>Your beliefs make a lot of sense, but when I studied the bible I just wasn't a fan of being a servant to God for eternity (was reading revelations at the time). It felt boring, like what am I gonna do for eternity? Serve god wine and cheese or chill out with him whenever he wants lol. Not my exact thoughts but it demonstrates my opinion on that matter. Then I started getting heavily into Buddhism because I like the idea that a human individual can become enlightened without being directly dependent on God for everything. I like the Buddhist teachings about oneness and the idea that we all are a piece of the same source consciousness experiencing other pieces of ourselves in a way.Since we are all one, and all things are connected, compassion and good actions towards other living things and the universe as a whole is ultimately compassion for ourselves and a key way to overcome suffering brought on by the birth and death cycle of samsara.
<|endoftext|>Can you prove you have read all this stuff? I don't doubt you have but I thought I would say it before someone else inevitably does:) good points though
<|endoftext|>Slave or servant. Sounds like choosing between being a field slave or a house slave lol. But either way you are on the plantation. How do you know it was somthing outside of ourself that made you "better" and not just all of your traveling learning and maturing as a natural process. And I'm looking at human sacrifice as it was forshadowed by all of the animal sacrifices in the Old Testament. God provided the way because it was his fucking idea or he wouldn't have had all the laws statutes pertaining to animal sacrifice in the Old Testament. What is God is real and so is Jesus and they are both the same fucking guy or two guys father and son just fucking with you?
<|endoftext|>You seriously need to get some help bro. You most likely have schizophrenia, and it isn't safe for you to go around spreading this utter nonsense to kids. Please get to a therapist ASAP before you cause some real damage to young impressionable minds.
<|endoftext|>God-source encompasses everything. All good, all evil, both Jesus and the devil. All part of the infinite god-source. That's the problem. It's working on the solution.
<|endoftext|>You're right. I do think your story is bullshit. Because it's either bullshit or what you're telling me is that the cure for being blind, lame, sick, etc is in east Africa. And that to be healed one would have to attend an Evangelical Festival. Why not go door to door in your own fucking country and heal your own neighbors? Sounds much more like you went on vacation and circle jerked each other about how powerful your god is when he only heals people that come to him. Or even allows disease in the first place.

<|endoftext|>Good username.12/25 is the winter solstice, it's a pagan holiday. The book of Revelations says Jesus will be born during a certain celestial alignment, which astronomers have found occurred September 11, year 3. The same alignment will happen this year, September 23. It only happens every 500 years or so.
<|endoftext|>Jewish new year 9-11 Orthodox Christian new year 9-11 Description of the shepherds in the Bible indicates a time around 9-11So as far as I am able to ascertain it *might* be his birthday. But in the end that is of no importance to you or me. It make no difference to us. What we need to concentrate on is to worship our Lord and have love in our hearts especially for one another. If I may, it's better to read the New Testament of the KJV than to waste once time finding out if 9-11 was indeed his birthday (but I obviously did so who am I to talk ;) ).
<|endoftext|>My name fits me. Your's does too, *occultowl*. Your allegiance is shown within it in fact.Your words are blatantly false, even blasphemous as you consider YHWH & Jesus to be the same as Ba'al and Molech.You don't even understand the story of Abraham, where Yahweh STOPPED the test of faith of Abram and PROVIDED a sacrificial ram instead. Jezebel is the most wicked woman in all of scripture, so of course she sacrificed for foreign God's. In fact that never stopped, still happens to this very day.You have no understanding of the difference between the two covenants, let alone the purpose of them. You are one lost soul brother. Why don't you get off reddit and reading doctrines from deceiving demons and actually pick up the Holy Word and read it for yourself? Quit relying on others to falsely explain it to you.
<|endoftext|>Look into Sikhism, it is essentially worship of the god-source that encompasses everything. That is what Christians worship when they worship god the holy spirit.
<|endoftext|>Everything I posted comes from studying Scripture and is backed accordingly my friend, all of it. *Listen carefully*, if you claim that you believe in Jesus, but you do not acknowledge that He is the same God from the Old Testament (YHWH), and that Jesus, as "The Word" was with the Father since the beginning, that they are One and that the Father is in Him and He is in the Father, than you **DENY** JESUS AS LORD and are just as deceived by those that stalk this place as all the others.Jesus is Yahweh/YHWH/Jehovah. He authored both the Old AND New Testament. I prefer to use another translation which is "Covenants." The entirety of the Bible, is about the Messiah, the Christ. All the OT prophecies pointed to Him which He filled Perfectly, to the literal day of the Festivals. God's timing is exact and precise, nothing is chance, nothing is random.Instead of spewing around this filth of Yabadabbadooda that you are all so willing to claim as true Truth, when you know nothing of the Truth, why don't you spend time meditating on REAL Names of God so that you don't continue to blaspheme and profane His name out of ignorance!*Abba, Elohim, Yahweh, El Shaddai, Adonai, Emmanuel, Yeshua, Jesus.***Marantha Yeshua ha'Mashiach, Maranatha.**
<|endoftext|>[Did Jesus Really Claim to be God?]( is the great **I AM**
<|endoftext|>There is only one True God. We really can't quite understand this with our finite minds, but take a look at this if you want to know more:[Explaining the Trinity and Christ](
<|endoftext|>God is a God of order, structure, law, categorization, sequence, hierarchy, etc. **NOT** randomness or chaos like you propose.There is a divine law that was created which includes a penalty for **SIN**, which is **DEATH**. Blood is the currency it is paid in. In order to be with God Himself, there must be **NO SIN**, for none can be found in Him. So the penalty must be paid, for God adheres to His own law.The default option is to pay with **YOUR** blood. This is the option you have presently chosen and the path you are on currently.In the days of man since Adam up until Jesus Christ (the last, sinless, perfect atoning sacrifice, *God in the flesh*) the penalty was paid with innocent the blood and lives of innocent animals. Imagine for a moment what a stark and sobering reminder would be if you had to slit the throat of an innocent animal **FOR YOUR PERSONAL SINS**. Do you think that might help put it in perspective just how destructive sin is, and the wickedness that abounds in all us in this fallen world? The devil perverts and twists everything ordained by God. He has turned these into sacrifices of humans and infants to appease *him*, the Father of lies, through the millions of false deities that exist throughout the world and passed down their ancient pagan civilizations. There's nothing new under the sun.We live in a time where we have the glorious and merciful option to have our personal sins atoned for by the ***Faith in Christ Jesus***, and what His sacrifice and sub-sequent bodily resurrection has done and the new door that is now open. This is a **FREE GIFT** of Salvation, that cannot by earned by any amount of 'good works'. You cannot 'buy' it. It is a gift of mercy from the God that created you personally, and everything you see before you. All things seen and unseen. I pray that you will find this truth before you are snuffed out for all eternity during the coming 7 year tribulation period that begins soon.
<|endoftext|>Take special note of the **bold** in Scripture below.Everything must always be read in context, this is a fundamental necessity to understanding the Bible and what God is conveying to us in a particular chapter or verse. Every Word is specifically chosen, including the *absence* of words, as is in this particular case. Sometimes the smallest details play an integral role. ---First let's rewind one chapter back to 19... **( Revelation 19:19-20 )** "And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. **These two** were thrown alive into the lake of fire that **burns with sulfur**."The context of this is the Battle of Armageddon at the end of the 7 year tribulation at the Second Coming of Christ along with the Host of Heaven (and saints, if you choose...) All the armies of the world that gather there are destroyed. 2 of the 3 main players during the Tribulation are cast into the lake of fire that **BURNS WITH SULFUR** *(note this)*---Now in Chapter 20, the scene is all about Satan and his imprisonment at the end of the tribulation period during the millennial reign of Christ on earth where peace will be restored for a literal 1000 years after the judgements of the tribulation period have been completed. Verses 1-6 cover these events in detail. Starting at verse 7, we fast forward to the end of the 1000 year period, where satan is released one last and final time for the *second* Gog & Magog battle where it is finally finished, and satan's end is finally reached, before the *New* Heavens & Earth are created (all sin will be purged in both realms permanently, eternally) **( Revelation 20:7-10 )** "And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, and the **devil** who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire **and sulfur** where the **beast** and the **false prophet were**, and **they** will be tormented day and night forever and ever."Verses 7-10 are all personally about satan (as is the context of the entire chapter). Note it specifically mentions the sulfur again, in ADDITION to the lake of fire. The Beast and False Prophet are ALREADY THERE because they were cast into it as covered above. The very last part of this I believe causes a great deal of confusion, as it reads: "will be tormented day and night forever and ever." Again, in context. WHO is there? (1) **Satan** (2) **The Beast**[anti-Christ] (3) **False Prophet** *[if i were to disclose my true opinion I would offend a great many roman catholics...]*Satan was formerly Lucifer, a beautiful angelic creature that was created as an immortal spirit, as all angels were. Their heavenly mutiny was a far more grievous sin than ours since they had been in the presence of Almighty. Their power and knowledge is unfathomable to us. They were created to live forever, therefore their punishment is equal to their sin. Since they were created to be eternal, they will be in torment eternally.---The scene below is the resurrection of the unbelieving dead for judgement. Everything is replayed for them perfectly, every moment, every thought, everything. Note the locations where the dead are raised from are listed separately ... The Sea, Death & Hades(hell). Different abodes of the dead, which is a topic for another day. **( Revelation 20:11-15 )** "Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. **And I saw the dead**, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the **dead were judged** by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the **sea** gave up the dead who were in it, **Death** and **Hades** gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. **Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire**. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, **he was thrown into the lake of fire**."At the end, the 'second death' is being cast into the lake of fire. However this time there is **NO** mention of burning sulfur!! There is a separate judgement that awaits mortal humanity, whom was **NOT** created immortal originally, and is conditional upon receiving the fruit from the Tree of Life.Note that both Death & Hades are **ALSO** thrown into the lake of fire. Death will be no more. Hell will be no more. Those whose names are not found written in the Book of Life that did not accept the testimony of God about Himself as Jesus Christ redeeming our temporary fallen world that exists under the shadow of darkness, will be no more.There are other scriptures in other books that reference an "eternal punishment" which seems to often be added to the "will be tormented day and night forever and ever." judgement for satan and his minions, and assumed to be talking about humanity. Separation from God **IS ETERNAL PUNISHMENT**. For nothing can exist outside of God, since He created everything and we all exist in Him. Without the light, there is only darkness. Without the heat, there is only cold. Without God, there is nothing. Nada. Eternal separation because you and your soul will be absolutely eradicated in the lake of fire, for all eternity. There is no reincarnation, there are no second chances.---Not enough?I understand. I had to search for more too. Since we were in Revelation, the last book, let's go back to the beginning at creation in Genesis **( Genesis 3:22-24 )** "Then the Lord God said, Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. **Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden** to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to **guard the way to the tree of life."**Notice the addendum at the end "lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever". Note the Cherubim placed there to ensure they couldn't regain entrance. God knows all, He created the phenomenon we call "time". He is outside of it, before it. The alpha, the omega, the beginning and the end. Since he knows all, sees all, and is all, and has complete fore-knowledge, knowing that our weak flesh would succumb and ignore the one and only command he originally gave Adam & Eve.Although this may be hard to accept, but kicking us **OUT** of the garden was actually showing us **MERCY**. For if we were allowed to stay in our present fallen sinful state, AND gain access to the tree, than we would **LIVE FOREVER** CURSED IN SIN. We are not like the angels, who were created as immortal spirits. We are flesh, blood. We are His precious children, that spit in His face and deny everything good and holy.---Lastly, as you study His Word and you learn first-hand of God's sovereign power and about his character you will start to develop an understanding of what He is like. Full of incredibly deep emotions we can't begin to fathom. He is a poet, a songwriter, a warrior, a king, and so much more. You will learn of His core attributes, such as Love & Mercy. Knowing this, it is **not in His character** if all the lost souls in this heavily deceived and demonically controlled world would be damned to an eternal torment in perpetual agony for all of eternity for choosing to deny God as Jesus Christ, thus forfeiting unimaginable rewards and inheritance of everything for all of eternity. It is far more **merciful** to absolutely eradicate all trace of them instead.His ways are not our ways, it is difficult for us to understand. Our vision is so small, we know so little. He knows everything about everywhere of all time. Trust in Him, and He will not lead you astray.EDIT: roman* catholic
<|endoftext|>Historically it goes deeper. The Catholic Church then attempted to stamp out this gnostic truth, destroying or hiding the evidence, twisting scripture. To this day I wonder if that is the 'ultimate' secret they hide in their catacombs. Allegro found the older Dead Sea Scrolls and was ostracized for his interpretation. FFWD to modern day, and mushrooms are illegal worldwide, a ban imposed by the United Nations. A simple lifeform that grows freely around the Earth is illegal. Depriving humanity of the mushroom/psychedelic keeps many in a sleepful, unwakened state. Not everyone needs the mushroom/psychedelic to awaken but a lot do, and a lot won't without it. the book: mushrooms and mankindAlso the reason mushrooms are the key is because our evolutionary ancestors long ago utilized them to punctuate the natural selection process and increase our creative intelligence.
<|endoftext|>Yes but we believe Jesus is the correct teaching and what God was always trying to convey love You enemy and treat your neighbor as yourself.
<|endoftext|>Jesus and Yahweh were both created by god the holy spirit, the god-source. Jesus is good. Yahweh is, like most people, a mix. He even called himself a jealous god in the 10 commandments.
<|endoftext|>The Archon Hierachy will do anything to keep both sides of humanity uninformed and to maintain this system of enslavement.The fact that many are reading this shows the control is weakening. What can we do to weaken it further, particularly on an individual basis? 
<|endoftext|>Thank you so much for replying. This is absolutely terrifying but I needed to know about it and I'm very eager to learn more. I will be spending a lot of time combing through your posts again this evening.Thank you for sharing everything you know with us on here!
<|endoftext|>I thought once you die you get reincarnated. How do people end up in Astral after life if that make sense? 
<|endoftext|>What are the beings? I had a long dissociative phase with MXE and DXM. It was pretty dark though a lot of times. It's like it enjoyed tricking me to believe crazy things.
<|endoftext|>I utilize past-life regression. Find someone trained in Shamanic practices or of the Dolores Cannon method.
<|endoftext|>That's why you will never break through. If you believe something is impossible than it is, at least for you. 
<|endoftext|> So, you basically just agreed with meNo I didnt.All three stand under the same Abrahamic umbrella.Only at the more external and popular level. But at their core beliefs they are very different. My conclusion is that they cannot be all true at the same time.. or they are talking about different beings..
<|endoftext|>Upon death the human is scanned. The images of deceased loves ones waving you into the light and the feeling of "incredible love" are actually taken from the dying person and reflected and significantly amplified back by the tech of the Archons. NDE has been their greatest tool of deception and the worst thing to happen to humanity. It has been incredibly successful advertising to get an already gullible and completely uniformed populus to embrace and walk right into the "White Light Trap":
<|endoftext|>"My sense of NDEs is that most of the people who go through them experience a profoundly loving presence, and they are pretty certain of their experience and feelings."This isn't actually true. There was a giant metastudy on NDE's a few years back (real academic work) - I'm off to work at the moment but will try to find the link again when I get back.In a nutshell, it found the loving, peaceful, and white-light tropes were stastically common ONLY in Western cultures (those influenced mainly by Christianity, even if those who experience it were not expressly Christian themselves). Far more common in all of Asia and India was the "bureaucratic" NDE experience - those people claimed to experience being lead into a boring "governmental" office of some kind, where boring workers claimed "problems with their paperwork" lead them there and that they should be sent back. (The "paperwork" trope in particular is incredibly common). Most did not report feelings of peace, bliss, etc. to go along with this.And, of course, NDE's themselves are entirely unpredictable, and the vast majority of those who clinically die and then are resuscitated experience nothing memorable at all in that time.What all this shows us, I have no idea - just pointing out that looking to NDE's and other experiences as somehow pointing to some kind of truth about the nature of the universe is probably not worthwhile.
<|endoftext|> then what can we trust? We can trust the people that claim the light is a trap. /sSeriously, I too have been wondering where those people get their knowledge from. 
<|endoftext|>Short answer here...mankind is governed by natural law. We are animals! When mankind doesn't abide by nature, the Archons become active. When you break the wrong laws, they will take your past and experience and twist your reality...think of them like federal prosecutors. Don't they have a happen of pushing for the maximum sentences? It's up to the lawyer for the defense to whittle down a plea or win the case. You can "beat" the Archons by eliminating negativity, pure and simple, but that is a tall order for MANY out there, and there are many paths for doing so. The interesting thing about reality is that there ISN'T one path for defeating the darkness, so to speak. Because it is intimately personal to everyone. Negativity is NATURAL, and that is the tough part. Understanding why we have negative feelings in the first place is the key to understanding ourselves, and defeat evil, really. Internal alchemy will always be the truest way to salvation.PM me if you want more info, but I can be rather dense at times (pun intended) :)
<|endoftext|>it makes sense to me, but how do we know that experience is real and not just a bunch of chemical reactions in our brain?
<|endoftext|> Or are you able to tune into something greater, through which you're able receive that feeling of truth?That one!And that is done by looking within. I'm not really trying to get into a complex game of semantics, what of these abstract things is yours and not yours. Too confusing. Feeling the compass and learning to follow it is surely enough?Have a great day my friend!
<|endoftext|>One hundred percent in agreement with you. I have family members involved in the occult. I have participated in exorcisms. Demons and spirits are real. Only thing that seems to have REAL power/hold over them is the name of Jesus. 
<|endoftext|>At the end of the day I'm going more with the Jedi metaphor. There is a light and dark side, we all have an incorruptible soul that belongs to you and you alone. Pretty sure no matter what your belief system (christian, buddhist or otherwise) you should never allow or encourage any entity, spirit, demon or whatever to inhabit your body.To "break free" possibly means to remove anything that isn't the true authentic soul self. Remove your ego, your race, your nationality, your desires, lust etc. Dissolve away anything and everything you thought was "you" until that inalienable, indestructible, eternal nugget at the center of your soul shines clean and bright like a diamond or star... something like that.As far as these demons and archons go, I guess the idea is not to be fooled by idols, and false gods. For example the "architect" in the matrix for all intents and purposes designed and created the entire world that neo lives in. Yet even with all that power, there are still constraint and limits on what he can and can't do. Therefore the arch is NOT God. Because God by definition has limitless power, knowledge, presence etc.tl;drDon't worship any entities, in fact anytime someone tries to flex and scare / manipulate you into thinking they are a  God (or claim can make you god) they're probably not.
<|endoftext|>Can you prove you have read all this stuff?I mean, if we were in person and talked you'd be able to tell I know what I'm talking about and I could show you my collection of theology/religion books. But otherwise me telling you that "Gnosis" is an excellent book that covers the differing varieties of gnostic history and gnosticism (there were christian flavors, zoroastrian, various greek/egyptian philosophy types) is worth reading, and telling you that the gnosticism frequently discussed in conspiracy forums pick and choose which types of texts to consider legit. I could tell you that some communities had compelling texts, but their communities were so out of place with Roman society at the time that they invited persecution, I could tell you how some forbid sex, some were suicide cults, others were run-of-the-mill cults, some did weird shit with kids, some had mandated orgies, some were just society-drop out hippie communes, I could tell you that the gospel of judas is interesting to read but at the same time literally useless in regards to personal application, I could tell you of my personal suspicion that the gospel of John was absolutely influenced by gnostic thought....but for all you know I looked that stuff up on wikipedia! Gnostic ideas are interesting! But I'm ultimately I'm not convinced because gnostics believed that the way to being saved (i.e. you're spirit bypassing the archons and demiurge to rejoin the pleuroma--the original God-being) involved knowing "secret knowledge" ("gnosis"). So what would happen in Roman times is that there would be a guy (let's say "Tim) who would claim to have received "secret passwords/codes" orally, by word-of-mouth, from some agent of the pleroma (in christian gnostic communities, Jesus is one such agent), and the gnostic texts were proof. So Tim would say, "I met a wise man who shared with me the secret codes he learned from Jesus. These secret codes will help us reach the pleroma after we die. Also, we need to wear these special necklaces. You should read 'The gospel of thomas' as proof that my explanation of reality is true. Also, you should live with us, work with/for us and give us all your possessions--oh and the secret knowledge can only be shared via sexual intercourse so we ALL have to have sex a lot, all the time." Gnostic communities were sometimes extremely ethical and strict, but from my own studies they don't sound nice, healthy or or sustainable.The problem is we do not have access to those "secrete knowledges"/secret passwords. The gnostic texts/gospels speak of them existing, but they don't say what they are. Just being aware of the gnostic worldview is not sufficient to being "saved" or returning to the original God/monad.So yeah, when you read gnostic history and you see how messy it was and how blatantly self-serving people were, to me that is not good proof that this is an accurate reflection of the spiritual world. Spiritual truth about a spiritual reality, in my mind, is evident when it brings about physical truth in my physical reality. Physical truth as in harmony, peace and life abundance. I do not see gnosticism as creating better people or helping me in any sort of concrete way here today, in the real world.
<|endoftext|>Wonder why you deleted your comment. If the god of the Bible didn't plan a human sacrifice from the beginning then why does his name YHWH in paleo Hebrew pictogram mean behold the nail behold the arm. Which to me seems to point to his plan of salvation aka human sacrifice from the very beginning. You see it's easy to have the solution when you create the problem in the first place. We are not seperate from the creator of everything. We never were. We are not sinners. I don't have to live my life for anyone's will but my own. My creator made me to be free not to be Her servant or slave. 
<|endoftext|>Posted elsewhere in this thread, but here's the expanded version:Suppose you're an infinite being. The problem with being an infinite being is that you have to be infinitely evil in addition to being infinitely good.So you want to find out how to stop being evil, and then you want to do whatever that is. The way to discover the solution is to setup a series of experiments, and the way to implement the solution is to setup an iterative process and run through it over and over.So you create an infinite universe, and then create an infinite number of these universes to make a multiverse. Then you run the experiment to find out what to do with evil.Ultimately, you come to the unfortunate conclusion that you're infinite, and you can't get rid of evil because that would require you to be finite. However, good news, you can quarantine evil.So you create a soul soup, think of it like an infinite bowl of mud, good water mixed with evil dirt. This soup is you. You create stars and worlds and people, and when each person is born, you pour some of the soul soup into them, creating them out of a part of you.So as part of this experiment, you now start an iterative process to identify, separate, and quarantine evil. You create karmic vacuum cleaners to gobble up and store all the evil dirt. When each person dies, you separate the dirt from the water. The water goes back in the bowl, the dirt in the vacuum cleaner. As you iterate this process, the soul soup gets increasingly clearer and the vacuum fills up. Iterate this for all of time, and mission accomplished. Fortunately, time is something you constructed, so this actually happens instantly for you.Now some people figured this out, and they put some names to it. The infinite being is god, the karmic vacuum cleaners are the devil(s) or archons, the soul soup is heaven, and the quarantine is hell. Different people have different names, but it's the same idea.We are all part of a larger whole that encompasses all matter, energy, and thought. We are running a simulation, a combination experiment and iterative process to solve the problem of evil. Our role is to materialize good and evil so it can be identified and separated. Our job is already done, but we don't know it yet. At some point we will be finished, and we will all come back to one.
<|endoftext|>1) here is the info you need:
<|endoftext|>I had older relatives who were really into the arcane and esoteric. At age 5, I began reading every book and magazine they had literally non stop. Decades later after reading thousands of books, magazines, articles and watching videos and listening to all kinds of recordings and live broadcasts, I began experimenting with different kinds of Astral Projection and Advanced Lucid Dreaming. At this point I was actually visiting with and conversing with deceased humans in the Astral Afterlife. There are people all over the world doing the same...
<|endoftext|>Hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, solar flares... Lots of shit. Whether you chalk it up to normal weather patterns or relate it to theories being discussed in this thread is for you to decide.
<|endoftext|>I think it happens even less often that that. Ive checked Stellarium and I cant find the exact alignment happen at any time other than 9/23/17. 9/11/3 isnt even an exact match.What do you personally think is coming in the next few months?
<|endoftext|>Very true friend. It really doesnt matter. I just finished Matthew in the New Testament, Im reading the Bible for the first time. Jesus made the ultimate sacrifice and it makes me want to cry just thinking about it. I really hope I get to meet him one day.Thank you for the reply and God bless!
<|endoftext|>Yeah, my name is not a great example, I'm aware. Let's say I like the owl as a symbol of knowledge and truth, not the one they worship at Bohemian Grove.I don't consider Yahweh to be Molech and that's not what I said. I definitely don't consider Jesus to be Molech, they are antithetical.
<|endoftext|>The devils that Jezebel worshiped are the same devils the pope worships. The sculpture of Jesus in a nuclear explosion in the papal auditorium and the fact that high level priests keep getting caught fucking kids and covering it up should tell you that. And those priests are the people who edited the bible, decided what was in and out.I am 100% pro-Jesus, make no mistake. I'm anti-kid fucking priests and the parts of the bible that push hate against women, gays, etc. because Jesus is love, not hate.
<|endoftext|>I didn't say anything was "truth". I posed a question. A question that apparently angered the demon inside you. P.S. Jesus didn't author anything. He walked, and ministered. Men wrote his stories. Peace out demon.
<|endoftext|>So god demanded innocent blood to pay for "sin" that he created in the first place? And you worship such a twisted being??? I mean I really can't believe some of the shit people like you spout. Why the hell would god not just snap his fingers and fix the problem? He's omnipotent right?Why create all this ridiculousness and actually punish the people you created for not believing this bs? Can you answer any of these questions without preaching? Using a logical argument? Or is logic just the work of the devil too? I'm assuming that's what you mean when you say "the devil twists and perverts" things. That's the automatic answer from all you religious extremists. Because you can't actually answer in a satisfactory, logical manner. I pray that you will find this truth before you are snuffed out for all eternity during the coming 7 year tribulation period that begins soon.Just stop for 1 second and think about what you're saying here.What kind of being would snuff out his own creation because we used the "free will" he supposedly gave us? If you think nothing is wrong with that, something's wrong with you. 
<|endoftext|>Again, what you are writing doesn't sound right ;)  Rev. 21:07 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God and he shall be my son. 08 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongerers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and **all liars, shall have their part in *the lake which burneth with fire and brimestone*:** which is the second death. So even if you try to differentiate between "lake of fire" and "lake of fire and brimstone" (which probably has merit) there are still people send to that eternal hell.
<|endoftext|>Its not difficult to understand. Basic logical deduction tells us that the Judeo-Christian god cannot possibly exist as described. Also, I can see based off how much you keep quoting Revelation that your pastor/priest went straight to that book to scare you into believing. My pastor did the same thing when I was a Christian. They *always* focus on Revelation, because that's the book that scares everyone so much that they believe simply out of fear for eternal punishment (wow what a nice god, eternal torture for exercising your free will. But he loves everyone! Makes perfect sense.)
<|endoftext|>Another great explanation. Thank you. For years I've had a worry I wanted to run past you. Corruption of His written word. You trust the Bible foundationally, and I need to be there. Here are my thoughts and worries.1. Translation issues. Where you point out nuances based on what words were used or not used, do you ever fear things lost in the translation? Or do you assume His hand guided the translators?2. Evil steering. As a kid, I always wondered having grown up Catholic, wouldn't the Bible have been a great way to control the masses? Romans got their mitts into it, British got their mitts into it, who knows what other groups working behind the scenes. It would likely bring Satan much joy to have perverted His bible in addition to the Catholic Church, I think you would agree. As the Bible has been edited (Enoch removed?) and it seems TPTB don't like us to have access to what they know - why would they allow us to have access to this?
<|endoftext|>You do absolutely fantastic work. Your ongoing posting of your research is helping people worldwide. At the end of the day everything points to the Archons. The "Soul Contracts" that they are using is what ultimately continues this horrific enslavement. Considering that most people, including many researchers have no idea who the Archons are, we really need to keep the knowledge of the Archons and what these "Soul Contracts" are flowing to the public. Everyone deserves to be saved from this enslavement. This incredible sub is what is going to turn the tide...
<|endoftext|>I would also recommend everyone really learns how to "Visualize". It needs to be the most important hobby anyone can do. The Matrix projects most of reality, but the time will come when people will have to create a "projected overlay" and effectively change scenarios. I practice this all the time and now at the point were the "hypnagogic imagery" that I am seeing in bed is beyond description. This book by the late Jose Silva is very low cost and mostly forgotten. It explains how to project on the "inner screen" of the mind. 
<|endoftext|>Thank you for being open minded and having the courage to embrace change. Together we will awaken humanity and create limitless worlds of infinite expansion :)
<|endoftext|>Time works differently. Seems simple here for us, but from Buddhist/occultist perspective time is a construct of this reality.
<|endoftext|>To teach everyone to be holy and to be prepared to have the set-apart spirit. He lets evil rule this world so people can always have a chance to turn back and help his people. He is always testing to see if we are worthy of the kingdom after he cleanses all that does not belong. And he does this to see who really loves him and his people. His people are the blacks that were taken away to slavery away from Africa and all those who love him and profess their love for him. I'm pretty sure we are in revelations now and the next stage or chapter will occur within 20 years. All the previous doomsday talk has been in preparation for what's to come very soon. Do you think Obama will take back power forcefully and have everyone take the chip in their hand sometime soon?
<|endoftext|>No I don't trust hypnotists either. DMT is a natural chemical in the body that is released when you sleep. However, if you don't sleep for a long time the DMT will build up in the body and can bring on an out of body experience. The key is to stay awake until you pass out which will trick the soul into thinking the body has died. Then you can leave your body and enter the spirit realm. This I have done many times. It does work. 
<|endoftext|>They must have a PhD in Clinical Psychology to practice, at least that is the law in most US States.
<|endoftext|>The three all follow after the Abrahamic tradition. I agree with what you a describing, but I think we conceptually differ regarding the 'core' beliefs. You are looking at the fine details, while I am looking at the broad mythos of the Abrahamic tradition. I agree with you on the details bit, but I am not referring to that; might just be a semantic issue on my part.
<|endoftext|>They are considered the three "Abrahamic religions," I mean, it's kind of hard to say Rhode Island isn't a state, just because it's so much tinier than the other ones.
<|endoftext|>Not all Christians believe in the trinity, although a great majority do, and the Quran addresses these people specifically on numerous occasions.Chapter 5, "The Table Spread": verse 73 have certainly disbelieved who say, 'Allah is the third of three.' And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment."The Quran also says in many places that the Quran was sent down to confirm what was previously given to mankind in the Torah and in the Gospel, but, because people changed those texts, the Quran has been sent down to state the message for the last time in the Arabic language so that it will not be changed in the way the Jews and Roman Pagans changed the texts for their own agendas.Chapter 10, "Yunus (Jonah)", verse 94 if you (O Muhammad) are in doubt concerning that which We have revealed unto you, [i.e. that your name is written in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] then ask those who are reading the Book [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before you. Verily, the truth has come to you from your Lord. So be not of those who doubt (it)."Chapter 4, "The Women": verse 47 you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down [to Muhammad], confirming that which is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as We cursed the sabbath-breakers. And ever is the decree of Allah accomplished."Chapter 4, "The Women", verses 51-52 you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture, who believe in superstition and false objects of worship and say about the disbelievers, 'These are better guided than the believers as to the way'?"Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed; and he whom Allah curses - never will you find for him a helper."Chapter 5, "The Table Spread": verses 46-48 We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous."And let the People of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient."And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ."There are many more examples. I greatly encourage everyone to read the Quran in its entirety and then decide for themselves whether they believe in it or not. As a former Agnostic, reading it with an open mind led me to accept Islam as my faith. I never knew what it actually said until I read it myself, and it is truly profound and convincing.
<|endoftext|>As far as I can see they differ in that they each represent the "perfection" of the one before. That is, Jesus came to "perfect"/reform/expand the Mosaic code, whilst Mohammed came to "perfect"/reform/expand Christianity.So, they all share the same root (which is in fact traceable back to Babylon) but then take the revelation further.
<|endoftext|>Take some responsibility for yourself , present and future. Look at what kind of ideas your forfeiting yourself to. Buddhism , especially Tibetan Mahayana , has studied reincarnation extensively for centuries. If your interested in a alternate pov start there. I accept that we are preyed upon and place the blame squarely on us. When we are done playing victim we can end this game instantly. Like a titan shaking off its slumber. 
<|endoftext|>From your link: We are recycled over and over until we break free.What does it mean to "break free"? So what is one supposed to do upon death? Well, I cant say with any certainty. I wouldnt go toward any tunnels or lights. And if angels and loved ones came, I would politely thank them for the invitation, but decline. The only light that you should be interested in is the light shining from your innermost soul. Follow that light, the light of your own Self, deep within. Im sure you will find your destination.To me, this feels like a cop-out. Also, while I agree in principle with the idea of following the light of your own "Self, deep within", that light ultimately emanates from the Ultimate Source (God if you will), so "freedom" should entail some kind of "closer" experience with the Source, or at least *something*. I have trouble with the idea of avoiding the Light if nobody can tell me what the alternative looks like.Again, I don't mean to be confrontational. It's just that it is a really important issue and I think we really do need to talk about what *else* exists other than the Light, if the Light is in fact False. If you are presenting the Light as False, then we need to know what is True in order to achieve true and valid discernment.
<|endoftext|>Most ND experiencers actually say they were *pulled* towards the light, and they couldn't stop it. They didn't walk voluntarily towards it. Good luck walking away from it. 
<|endoftext|>I died of anaphylaxis 23 yrs ago. Before I was resuscitated I followed the light tunnel. It was lovely. Since then I have had amazing experiences. It shaped my life. In a trance state I have had visions of what Gnostic beliefs gave names too . The greatest fable being that someone died for our sins. Therefore, relieving us of personal responsibility. The more we think we are Saved no matter what, then the less we care about the bad we have done. This plane of reality is our prison. Whether we wronged the creator or somehow chose this experience, Im not sure. Someone once told me that when the 3rd of the heavenly host rebeled against god they were cast down to earth. If that is so, we are the descendants of the fallen. We live, die, live, die... until one day we have finally paid for our wrongdoings. I can remember peices of many different lives. I have married my wife a hundred times. My soul has split into other beings after death. There is no limit to how much we can split our energy. Most of us never realize what we are capable of, so we never leave this prison because we cannot remember the last time. Our negativity piles up and we return to correct it. The veil blinds us to our personal truth. We can break the veil. Meditative trance, LSD, mushrooms, Heavy cannabis cocentrate. These all have consequences and benefits. DMT has always eluded me. Been looking for years but it hasn't happened yet. Just remember, We are pure light energy.Energy is eternal from one state to the next. DNA is somehow, simultaneously our physical reflexion of that energy and a physical cage. Be kind and good. The shadow ones hate your goodness. Do not acknowledge them. Do not call to them. They will attach to you and hinder you throughout time. If you ignore them, they become bored and they move along. All of this because I died at the age of 19 for 1.5 minutes. 
<|endoftext|>Just a feeling I suppose. I have the distinct recollection of being inside of my mind and touching something other than myself. Something vast... Never spoken of it before.
<|endoftext|>Thank you for your re-assurance. I've never experienced any of this personally, but I've been drawn to it for years.I only recently reached this conclusion after many breakthroughs in my knowledge. All of these occult systems have the same motif behind them, the original Luciferian lie: "ye shall be as Gods".All of them more or less point to the same path of opening your body and spirit to demonic contact if not possession. Of calling on these spirit forces to complete your 'Great Work'. What fools...If you don't mind, could you share your experience with the occult and what drove you towards Jesus Christ? It would help me a lot to know more about another Christian's experience on this topic.
<|endoftext|>Thank you for that. I shall look into this further. My comment about what proof do you have was tongue in cheek as you seemed to know your stuff ;)
<|endoftext|>I've been researching all this for a couple of weeks. I'm interested in getting deep into this and learning all I can. How can I start learning some of this myself? Where does the path you've traveled begin? Do you recommend any books?
<|endoftext|> God doesn't expect animal sacrifices until humans establish it as a traditional way of pleasing God with a gift of their labor. Some gods do. Jesus doesn't. I'll take Jesus over Yahweh or whatever told Abram to kill his son.
<|endoftext|>I got news for you. If you take the set of all natural numbers and then eliminate the odd numbers, the set is still infinite :)Eliminating half of an infinite set doesn't make it finite. I think you don't understand what infinity means.
<|endoftext|>cool. i dont doubt any of that, just in my own experience, i've found myself encountering various "supernatural" entities/forces, and finding them to be reflections of myself, with the "final answer" to all this being that i was, in a sense, the creator, and that all that seemed to be holding me back was just something inside of me
<|endoftext|>I've seen conflicting analysis, depending on how close an alignment you're looking for, but it's definitely very rare.I'm not sure if Revelations is a prophecy, but I know some very powerful people are using it as a playbook.
<|endoftext|>Awesome to hear brother! You will definitely will want to read the gospel of John as well early on. To understand the very beginning verses of it substitute "the Word" with "Jesus" as you read it and you will *see* one of the meanings that is being said. =O)May Yeshua bless you in your spiritual growth & maturity as we all continue to gain understanding and interpret His Living Word that was graciously given to us during these last days and times.
<|endoftext|>Check out the very upper right corner of a $1 bill (may need magnifying glass) and you will find an owl there too. It is one of many symbols the occult have used for a long time, whether that's the intended meaning or not. More specifically, there are many different gods (Yahweh, Ba'al, Jesus, Molech) described within.Although you did not explicity say that Jesus is the same as Molech, it is *implied* through that statement when you associate those 4 names together as all being "god's". You are implying that there is no hierarchy between them, and they are all in equal standing with one another. This is false.There is ONE True Living God, whom created ALL THINGS, including the eternal immortal spirits (angels) of which 1/3 of them fell, and followed the mutiny and deceit of Lucifer. Molech and Ba'al are just two of many many many false idols intended to steal the legitimate worship from God, for that is what the devil craved the most. He wanted to BE GOD, he wanted to be worshipped as God. So he counterfeits it here on earth, with the little time that he has.There is structure, order and a hierarchy. There is nothing above, or equal to the True God. He Himself is the creator of all the fallen 'gods' that (due to angels being granted free will, the same as us) chose to reject Him.Jesus is God *in the flesh*, and He claimed to be the great "I AM", as He rightfully is. In fact, this claim is the **ENTIRE REASON** that the Jewish leaders of the day (mostly pharisees) hated him so much. They did not recognize him and were ignorant to the prophecies of His coming (just like today). His claim as the Son of God, is the very thing that he was crucified for (which was intended all along), as His death and resurrection is the single act that defeated both the devil, and death itself.
<|endoftext|> The devils that Jezebel worshiped are the same devils the pope worships.I agree. The sculpture of Jesus in a nuclear explosion in the papal auditoriumAlso agree, the Paul VI Audience Hall is built so that you appear to literally be inside the head of a snake, complete with eyes, fangs, and that blasphemous abomination of a sculpture -  diddling goes hand-in-hand with satanists, and a whole lot more too, that's just the tip of the sick demonic iceberg. I take comfort in verses like **Luke 17:1-3** where it says: "Jesus said to his disciples: Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. **It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble**. So watch yourselves."All will be revealed, every hidden sin done in secret dark places. All will be exposed, and there will be divine justice at the end of this age. The kid diddlers are gonna BUUURRRN, they have no idea what's coming their way, and they most definetly do not worship Jesus.If you are wondering why there is much corruption and pedophilia in the Roman Catholic church, it's because they are NOT the true church like they claim to be. In fact they have more in common with a full blown cult like Jehovah's Witness or Mormons than they do with a True God-Fearing Biblical Christian. This false Jesuit pope they thrust into office now is most likely going to play a very large role in the coming tribulation period. I do not support or condone anything in the catholic church, nor do I even consider them a valid denomination of Christianity. They are very, very deceived, and there's so much evidence for it I don't understand how any true believer that claims to be Catholic can't see the corruption within.Sidenote: Rome is *spiritual* Babylon. Read **Rev. 17-18** if you want to know the role it will play and it's eventual destruction. Substiture the word "babylon" with "rome" and it will make more sense when you read it. the parts of the bible that push hate against women, gays, etc. because Jesus is love, not hate.Women being treated as inferior is from those that do not understand what the Word says. Even back in Genesis, when Eve was formed from the rib of Adam, this is symbolic of where a woman's place is in relationship to her husband. BY HIS SIDE. Not above him or in front of him, and not beneath him or behind him. By his side, as it was intended.Jesus (God) does **not** HATE homosexuals or lesbians. He loves the person, but He does indeed HATE THE SIN. Men lying with men is a particular grievous offense and considered "an abomination". Women lying with women is "unnatural". When a society completely embraces this lifestyle, like we see today, the end of that civilizations reign is always near. When the angels appeared in Sodom to rescue Lot and his family, the men there literally tried to rape the angels (who appeared as men).You used the analogy of the woman caught in adultery before. Jesus did not CONDEMN her, but neither did he CONDONE her sin. In fact he specifically tells her to "leave her life of sin" :**( John 8:11 )** Then neither do I condemn you, Jesus declared. Go now and leave your life of sin.Here is a write-up from someone with a lot more knowledge than myself writing about this topic:[Homosexuality and the Bible](
<|endoftext|>Demons don't DEFEND Jesus Christ or point to Him as being God. Demons don't point people to scripture or speak truth. They spew only lies and will tell you anything your itching ears want to hear as long as it is against the truth: Jesus is Lord (God).If you think it was mere men that wrote the Bible in it's entirety, you are sadly mistaken.
<|endoftext|>You assume that I have completely bypassed logic, reasoning and critical thinking and replaced it with some view of magical fairy tales from an invisible man in the clouds. I have done no such thing!!!In fact, the truth is I value those attributes highly, as I will born with them ingrained in me. It is actually part of the reason why it took SO LONG for me to believe and finally understand that the Bible is what it says it is, the Word of God that was given through men via supernatural means, that there is a spirit realm beyond the veil that we cannot see and most importantly that Jesus Christ is what He claimed to be, the Son of God, whom is also God, in a concept that we can only barely begin to conceptualize, let alone comprehend the mere concept of this triune quantum nature of God whom is outside of time and matter.Like you, I couldn't rationalize it in my head. Now I can say that I think I understand why that was now.You are basing your logic & rational thinking off of a foundation of sand and unstable. It is based merely on the intellectual limitations of yourself and other men. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,  but fools despise wisdom and discipline." - **Proverbs 1:7**I am basing my new found logic & rational thinking upon the Word of God and the Truth contained within it, thus my foundation is laid upon a Rock, and is stable. "Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in the ways of this world, he must become a fool to become really wise. *For the wisdom of this world is nonsense in Gods sight.* For it is written,He catches the wise with their own trickery, and again, The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless. - **1 Corinthians 3:18-20**Now, thankfully I can say that I have reached a point (in just over one short year, for what it's worth) that the critical thinking side of me has actually help solidify my faith in Christ and the Word, and I know with certainty because of ssoooo many reasons, I couldn't even begin to list them as to why and do the list any justice. However, one of the major reasons for me personally is due to prophecy. Of which, believe it or not, is evidently going to be continued to be fulfilled later this year according to the dozens of physical, figurative, symbolic and even one big giant literal sign *('in the heavens')*.When I see this Book that was written over a period of 1,500 years by 40+ different authors, that claims divine origin (rightfully so), that literally tells the future with 100% accuracy, that accompanied by the Spirit of God (that is a very tangible and real thing) can reveal the answers to any questions you might have about what the purpose of this life is, why the world is a fallen state of decay that it is, and on and on ... I can't really understand anymore how anyone that has genuinely pursued it and given it a chance (as in actually pick it up and start reading parts of it instead of relying on everyone else's twisted and perverted viewpoints and learn it for yourself) could walk away with anything less than a radically different outlook on this world we live in and where it is headed.---I'll give you one example. You said: "pay for "sin" that he created in the first place"Of course your logic & reasoning regarding things is going to be incorrect and not correlate correcltly because right here I can tell you that you have a mis-understanding of what sin is, where it came from, and the fact that it was **not** God whom ***created*** sin. Thus the foundation on what you are trying to rationalize from and come to a logical conclusion is inherently flawed, thus the outcome will be as well.Try thinking in terms of sin as more of a by-product, or rather the abscence of something. More specifiically, it is the ***abscence*** of a moral code, law, order, justice, light, good, etc. When you turn off a light in your bedroom and it becomes pitch black, what is it that you just did? Did you turn off the normal "light" and turn on the "dark light"? No, you snuffed out the light. There is now an ***abscence*** of light, and you are now permeated in **darkness**.The same is true with cold. Cold is merely the ***abscence*** of heat !!* Without good, there is only evil.* Without light, there is only darkness.* Without heat, there is only cold.* Without God, there is nothing.
<|endoftext|>Thank you for responding using Scripture. Indeed you are correct, that verse does include the sulfur/brimstone reference as well : ( **Revelation 21:5-8** ) "And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I am making all things new. And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true. Then He said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost. He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. **But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death**.If the idea was based entirely on the use/abscence of that one word, the argument would fall apart. Perhaps this passage is describing a particular group of people? There is a specific group that is clearly not consumed in the lake of fire, and are in eternal torment, seen in this passage: ( **Revelation 14:9-12** ) "Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image, **and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand**, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in **full strength** in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone **in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name**. Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus."Take this, and add it to the other examples I listed above, and I can see four groups or individuals listed specifically as having eternal torment.*Revelation 14:9-12* = those who specifically take the **Mark of the Beast** during the Tribulation period are poured out a cup a full strength cup of wrath.*Revelation 19:19-20* = **Beast** (anti-Christ) & **False Prophet***Revelation 20:7-10* = **Devil**There's also the parable of the wheat & the tares, and those being separated, with one being thrown into the fire. Fire consumes everything, it burns it up, there is nothing left but dust and ash. God is often referred to as a "consuming fire". This is why we are presently separated from Him, because of our sin for it must be that way. If any of us were to suddenly be in His presence, we would be absolutely eradicated due to the sin present in us.Notice that both Death & Hades (hell) are thrown into the lake of fire also. They are done away with, for there is no more need for them (hell is a *temporary* prison for spirits). Even the eternal torment listed in the above verses mentions the location specifically as being in the presence of the angels and the Lamb (Jesus). They are not being tormented eternally in hell, because hell no longer exists at that point.Perhaps i'm wrong, it's certainly possible. But I just don't get the impression from reading Scriptures and more importantly from having at least some minute insight into the character of God as it is taught in the scriptures and experienced in my personal life. God is Just & Merciful. These traits would contradict an omnipotent God that is outside of time and sees all that we have done before we have even done it, and yet He would create us fleshly humans, whom he Loves, but condemn that indigenous tribal person tucked away in some remote forest to eternal life in perpetual agony and unimaginable suffering? It just doesn't make sense.Personally I think that absolute annihilation of body, soul, mind and spirit at the Throne of Judgement for those that took the wide path to destruction in this life (which most do, *"for the path is narrow and few will find it"*) is a far more **merciful** act, than to leave them in eternal torment. Nor would that be justice, the crimes did not warrant it. The cup is poured out **proportional** for each individual that is **not covered by the Blood of the Lamb**.Check out a topical study on these concepts. Of course they should be read in context (whole chapter preferably) to get an understanding of the message that is being conveyed. [Consuming Fire]( Second Death]( of Fire]( ~9,300 topics]( what it's worth here's something I wrote a year ago that relates to this subject: We know that UV light kills all bacteria, right? Have you ever thought of God's "light" of having that same effect on the sin that is in each and every one of us? Perhaps He protects us by having a veil between us and Him for if He were to present Himself to us, bathed in His Glory, we would all be immediately eradicated and destroyed because of the sin(darkness) within all of us. Since all (100%) of us have been born into sin, the darkness resides inside us, woven into our very existence, probably into our very own genetic structure on this planet. The very exposure to God/Christ in His true form would completely destroy us as sinners in our fleshly mortal form. God is perfect. God is love. God is light. He has NO darkness or sin whatsoever in Him. He is completely pure. Not even the smallest amount of sin can be allowed to enter Him (nor can He be tempted by it). No evil comes from Him. He cannot be corrupted by it like we have been. Thus why we must be "reborn" from this earth and reborn from the spirit in Him. Our earthly, physical, fleshly bodies must remain here. The wages of sin, even in the most minute form is made known to us. The wages of sin is Death. Period. No exceptions. Since we have been born into sin, we were doomed to die before we were even born. The only way the uniqueness and individuality that makes us who we are can be saved is through the free gift of Salvation through Jesus Christ that was given to us by God's grace. A free gift of grace that CANNOT be earned through good works on this earth. Only the acceptance of the FREE GIFT that grants us eternal salvation that is freely and openly available to anyone, anywhere, at anytime, guarantees us a spiritual re-birthing that is free from sin into a heavenly body that Our Lord has prepared for each of us. The flesh must remain here. It is doomed to die and perish in the fires of this world at the end of the age. These mortal bodies were formed from dust, and will return to dust. Our eternal soul can be saved by His grace and our acknowledgement and acceptance of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, recognizing Jesus as the Son of God, whom paid for our sins by being the last, and most perfect blood sacrifice on the Cross. We as believers in Christ will be reborn anew from within, baptized in the Holy Spirit. We will become Children of God, grafted into His family through the blood and sacrifice that was given to us by the mercy, love and grace from God to us all as a free gift. A gift that we must choose to take of our own free will. You must choose.
<|endoftext|>I know you're just trolling a bunch of my comments, so I won't waste too much time responding.I can't not but love the irony of how true Truth is so often the exact opposite of what we think and that others say. Like in this case, where the truth is my pastor is a 'good news' evangelist, that teaches foundational & fundamental doctrine of Christianity without a bunch of denominational man-made crap or 'political correctness' added in. He has done so for 40+ years and is very gifted.That being said, he won't touch prophecy with a 1,000ft pole. There's unfortunately too much division caused by those who can't understand pre/mid/post-trib pre/post-wrath, and on and on. These things have unfortunately been stripped out of many modern day churches, which has left so many blind to the epic and blatant signs of the times. I, on the other hand, have basically the opposite issue.
<|endoftext|>**(1)** Different translations were a big stumbling block for me too early on (and by 'early on,' i mean just over 1 year ago). I prayed about it, asked for guidance. One night I just 'happened' to discover that I had Bibles laying around my house of many different translations all from relatives that have gone on and gave to me, undoubtedly knowing one day I would need them. Some of them I didn't even know existed, let alone ever opened. I think i laid out like 5 different ones that were all from a relative one night. That's an example of prayer answered, and quickly too. Now, I use many different translations. I would highly encourage anyone to NOT stick to just one (many claim only KJV, etc, which is ridiculous). There's plenty of web tools available that let you compare particular verses against many different translations, which is often helpful.Of course, when you can go back to the original Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek, this is your best option. Again, web tools are available such as lexicons and interlinears."In the [beginning]( chiefest, firstfruits, part, time, principal thingFrom the same as ro'sh; the first, in place, time, order or rank (specifically, a firstfruit) -- beginning, chief(-est), first(-fruits, part, time), principal thing.*see HEBREW [ro'sh]( words have multiple meanings associated with them depending on the context it's used in. There is incredible compound meanings contained within the Bible. God is a masterful author. Many verses even have multiple meanings and interpretations of which ALL can be valid.**Revelation 12:1-2** is a perfect example, where "the woman" represents at least THREE different things, and is talking about events both in the past **AND** future, simultaneously. Because, well, God and all.I also look at the Dead Sea Scrolls that were found in the Qumran Caves 70 years ago as an additional witness to this generation that the texts we have are indeed very accurate. I've read statistics from some scholars that claim 99%+ accuracy, which is astonishing for such an old text (if it wasn't divinely inspired and protected). Different translations speak to different people. I prefer a word-for-word translation, others might like a thought-for-thought. For instance, I can't stand the NLT version, but I know those who love it. It's "simple" and "easy" to understand. If that speaks to them, well great! I prefer to deep-dive and care particularly about accuracy, so I won't touch that version.I think the thing to remember is the Spirit of the Message is intact. No matter if you read a KJV, NIV, ESV, NASB, etc, everyone should come away with the same understanding that Jesus is Lord, and He is our only hope of eternal salvation.EDIT: That being said, there absolutely are false additions to the Word, such as what the catholics add, JWs, Mormons, etc. Stay far away from these deceving doctrines, they are co-written by demons, not God. EDIT 2: Other or "lost" books are a whole other discussion. God doesn't "lose" anything, they were not canonized for a reason. There is clear evidence in the text of the Bible that there are other books, such as Jashar and the Book of War (songs for war). Enoch is most likely one of them too, and these also had many fragments recovered in the Dead Sea Scrolls. If Enoch is divinely inspired, I personally think it was saved and not revealed again until this last generation, knowing that lost/forgotten truths would need to be taught again (Nephilim in particular)[Book of Jashar](
<|endoftext|>1. God is all powerful and full of love, so God made sure his love letter to you was accessible to you. For the English speaking word it is the King James Bible. It's such a great translation, that I read it and English is my third language and I generally am poor with languages. I truly envy you that you have such a beautiful gift in your native language. 2. You are correct in your assessment of satan. e.g. II Corinthians 2:17 "For we are not as many which corrupt the word of God..." They started their attempt to misinform and lead man astray from the beginning. The book of Enoch is such a misinformation. Same goes for the new translation that get released over and over and over. The new translations through out important parts of the scripture. e.g. Acts 8:37 where the Ethiopian eunuch gets the answer to his question what he needs to do to be acceptable unto Christ. The answer btw. is, you need to belief in Jesus Christ as your God and Saviour. Because you cannot save yourselves, God needs to save you. And that is a gift.  Also the Bible cautions you to judge for yourself, because someone that is fooled and lead astray will get the same punishment as someone who is willfully leading people into damnation. Ignorance is no excuse. My suggestion: Get a KJV Bible app that offers a reading plan and read the New Testament once. I think three month is a manageable pace. It's really the best and easiest thing you can do. It changed my view dramatically. And I too was a confused catholic who lost his faith :)
<|endoftext|>I'm not familiar with what their views are on that subject, but i'd like to think that even if they share a similar interpretation on a particular topic that I do, that it is a superficial similarity at best. I am purposefully non-denominational and have no association with cults. There is only One High Priest, whose name is Yeshua.The Tree of Life was in the Garden of Eden, along with the Tree of Knowledge of Good & Evil. Eating from this tree, sentenced all mankind to death and brought forth sin and a curse. Jesus Christ provided the atoning sanrifice by being crucified **ON A TREE**, suspended between Heaven & Earth, which has granted all whom have faith in Him eternal life once again. Note the Tree of Life is mentioned as being in New Jerusalem again in [Revelation 22]( made a long response (why can't I just do a short quick reply ...) [HERE]( you might want to read.
<|endoftext|>Can this visualisation manifest itself in our actual "reality"?I've just bought the book based on your recommendation, can't wait!
<|endoftext|>No, the military backs Trump. We are definitely entering a new era. I had a vision/understanding of generation after generation working to make things better. Working toward a heaven on earth. Call me an optimist, but I think we'll be ok. That said, maybe that's just a possible future. Crazy times ahead.
<|endoftext|>Where in the fuck do you find this stuff out? Is there some kind of site that has all of this info organized and layed out? I need to see for myself. Do you have to abstain from pot and alcohol for a while to do this stuff? 
<|endoftext|>Transcendental meditation uses a similar technique. You focus on killing your body part by part starting with a toe and working your way up. It too disconnects the spirit from the body. 
<|endoftext|>Is this just one way to have an out of body experience, or the DMT is what causes any and all OBEs? Once I took a nap and I supposed I was out of my body because I reached the ceiling of my house, crashed through it into the sky and then spiraled into a dark area with red vacuum/spiral tunnel .. not sure if that was caused by DMT in my body, but I had to scream (not through my physical body) to get out of this ; too much to handle at the time. 
<|endoftext|> However, if you don't sleep for a long time the DMT will build up in the body and can bring on an out of body experience.  Well that explains a lot... 
<|endoftext|>I disagree.The whole concept of God and Nature of Mankind are examples of the very basic foundations of a belief system and those are different between the three main Abrahamic traditions (I just pointed some..)I know what you said, but my answer is "not exactly".
<|endoftext|>When a loved one passes it is extremely important to maintain contact. This absolutely can be done. It takes some effort, but I am currently doing it. Visualization is our greatest gift and ultimately the strongest ability in creation. Looking at photos and/or videos of loved ones, combined with a meditative use of the inner "visual screen" reestablishes that connection. The mind needs to be saturated with positive imagery of persons and events. If anyone has lost a loved one and needs more info on this, feel free to contact me.
<|endoftext|>You are a filing cabinet, with one open file. When you found your grandparents, you opened two more files. There's tens of billions of files inside you. One is your wife. You just have to look.
<|endoftext|>I agree with you about the "Source". But unfortunately the Archons have created electromagnetic barriers around this closed Matrix. By effectively barricading themselves and everyone else within this Simulation, they have established a system based on Vampirism and Parasitic Behavior.
<|endoftext|>It seems to be a magnetic process. This is why training outside of the body is extremely necessary but sadly is done by very few. The human energy field/soul can be controlled and directed with out of body training, as well as advanced meditation and visualization development.
<|endoftext|>I'll never forget a friends experience with Salvia.He said he smoked Salvia and came to a place where he was being, along with other (souls?) around him, pulled towards an inevitability. He said he could hear music unlike anything he'd ever known. (he's a techno producer so that was an interesting feature of his story)He said as he was pulled towards this inevitability he was worried. When he felt that worry he said he could hear the voices of family, almost laughing and reassuring him all is well.He said he then understood that this was the process of death, where the soul and body are separated.
<|endoftext|>Have you considered - what if your trances / visions, and the "knowledge" they seem to profess, are lies? Intentional ones - to keep you from God? The greatest fable being that someone died for our sins. Therefore, relieving us of personal responsibility. The more we think we are Saved no matter what, then the less we care about the bad we have done.This does not sound in any way, shape, or form like what I've come to learn of Jesus. It is the tiniest partial-truth, otherwise known as a lie. I don't mean at all that you are lying (you are clearly seeking truth, a wonderful process, as I am) - I mean that you have been lied to, and it is believable because hypocritical religious people are everywhere. They are not what you find in the words of Jesus - accepting him is embracing love incarnate. Yes, it is the relief of guilt, but for the express purpose of getting on with the business of loving and stopping doing evil.Anyway, I would encourage you to fast, pray for truth, and read the Bible, and PM me if you feel the need. Sorry if this has come across as preachy. It's just that I just went through a similar journey, including a brief stop at Gnosticism. You're nearly there. The veil isn't something you can break through of your own effort and drugs. It's the person of God and he will do it if you just ask.Peace!
<|endoftext|>I totally understand. But there seems to be a real conflict between that experience and this one, the one we are in under normal circumstances. Which one is the real one? Are they both real, but different dimensions?
<|endoftext|>I took a large(for me) dose of acid and felt like I broke through into the fifth dimension. I felt like I was falling through the cracks in the moments and I thought reality was dissolving. I soon after watched Interstellar and that scene at the end in the bookshelf was eerily familiar. 
<|endoftext|>Your just a bunch of chemical reactions! Lol but really, life is made of simple chemical processes and reactions but I would also say that life is a spectacular miracle. My opinion is that everything around you that seems so ordinary, is in fact extraordinary and more complex and beautiful than anything you can imagine, we just are perceiving it through our own distortions of the mind and blinded by ignorance from the fact that life is amazing!
<|endoftext|>all of what you said is true. but NOT inside this Simulation. you are the "creator". we ALL are. sadly Parasitic Aliens called "ARCHONS" have barricaded themselves and all of us into a small simulation that is cut of from the "Real Free Universe" and the "Eternal Source Energy". If we work together and raise the Group Consciousness we can transform the prison into a paradise...
<|endoftext|>I just read Revelations 17-18. I just started reading the bible and your comments interest me a lot and i feel like i can relate to you, all this evil pointed me toward Jesus and God. Could you explain that passage a little more for me please? Im confused but it does kind of make sense when i replace Rome with Babylon because the evil Vatican is located there (i think). Thank you, much appreciated.
<|endoftext|>Romans 9:14 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth._19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?20. **Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?**21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and anoher unto dishonour?_22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, [...](
<|endoftext|>I'm not trolling you, I'm presenting logical arguments while you're just citing the fairy tales you believe exist, as if that somehow is an argument for such a thing's existence. And if your pastor is a "good news" evangelist you wouldn't be sitting here quoting Revelation and telling me how I'm going to be snuffed out of existence for using logic and reasoning. More Christians really need to focus on Jesus' teachings rather than the end times, fire and brimstone.
<|endoftext|>Wait, how did you know he was a bot vs an adoring fan? Seems he deleted his account. Or no he didn't. A 4 year account with no comments.
<|endoftext|>Joe Rogan has talked about DMT on his radio show. Graham Hancock has gave a TED talk on the subject which was since banned. Check YouTube.
<|endoftext|>DMT will always be linked to any and all OBEs even if other things seem to be the trigger. Even full on death itself involves DMT. When the body dies it releases "death endorphins" which includes DMT. This kicks the soul out of the body and into the spirit realm.
<|endoftext|>Are you a Vegas-type Hypnotist or a registered clinical psychologist who does reverse hypnotherapy; and if you are the latter, what state are you employed in, so we all can stay away :)
<|endoftext|>I mean, true, i see your point. Examples: the fictional Hannibal Lecter held a doctorate yet he killed, cooked, and ate his victims; the factual MKULTRA experiments brutally destroyed their victims' psyches. I completely understand the paranoia there. But from a more realist take on things: a lot of doctors of clinical psychology that practice hypnosis or reverse-hypnosis (when guiding patients through a past-life regression) do so with an open heart and an eager mind prone towards furthering discovery of newfangled knowledge, both for the patient's awareness and their own. For example, look at the excellent work done by Dr. David Jacobs or Dolores Cannon; talk about revealing mysteries of the Archons. Jacobs and Cannon have done very great work in this regard. Jacobs and Cannon have done very similar yet differing work in the same field too. I would check them out by reading their books and articles. Don't look them up on Rational Wiki or some other disinformation hub, because they have been under heavy disinformation internet firing squads for a while now. That should tell ya something about how precise their findings are.Overall, when a doctor or a shaman is helping to guide you, you are in good hands. There will ways be bad eggs, but if you research for the right people, you will be rewarded.
<|endoftext|>Broadly speaking, I would go with HorusNoon on this one. You said Christians are trinitarians, but that is true whilst being unitarian. You are forgetting that if you are dealing with God, things need not be mutually exclusive and "irreconcilable". There is an ALL, and that doesn't mean that there isn't a framework or frames of reference for one's experience with God (or w/o). How would you feel if you were born Muslim?
<|endoftext|>One time I was in this really dark place. And I was at my computer and mostly out of my mind. I had this little reclining chair off to the side, and I saw this young couple sitting there looking at me that I didn't recognize. And for a moment I felt alright, and I got out of that darkness. Found out my grandmother I loved had passed away, and we went through her stuff and I found a picture of her and my grandfather, who I had never met, in those same outfits. I had been an atheist most of my life, and completely dead to the spiritual, until that moment. And now any time I visualize them in that way it seems to mean something extra. I dunno, is that along the lines of what you are talking about?
<|endoftext|>You're promoting communicating with evil beings that are taking advantage of human emotion and want for things lost. That's why it's call Rest In Peace. God or the Set-Apart Spirit will not communicate through passed relatives. The accounts of Moses and Jesus show evil sorcery is active and should be avoided such as tarot, weegee boards (Goddamn the spelling), hand life lines, numerology, fretting over numbers or the stars. Our sorcery is to trust in God, worship and fear him, and he will bring the Set-Apart Spirit through us to demonstrate his power to the depraved. The in-your-face evil that comes into our everyday through Satan and his medical/technocratic puppets, is the vaccines they Force upon your younger family members, the food they conveniently place on your tired/overworked path, and the tech they keep you asleep and distracted with. God bless you and take the nag hammadi texts with a grain of salt but deeply study them, especially the ones referencing the Son of Man
<|endoftext|>Interesting. It would be really nice to be able to open several files. But if I open their file, do they have to open mine as well? Can people open the files of others they do not want to interact with?
<|endoftext|>I shit you not i had this same experience! I was in high school and about 20 of us were hanging out in my buddy's garage, my gf at the time next to me, I took a bong rip of salvia that my buddy handed me, next thing i know everything became a grid, i could see everyone basically graphed onto a 3D plane and the lines of their cubes were completely visible and consistent when i moved/looked around. Next thing I know I'm being dragged downward into the void and everyone was being stretched as the 3D plane was being pulled in with me, everyone was laughing(obviously) ad when i finally started to return to "normal" i was absolutely terrified. I hadn't remembered this for years but after reading your comment an all the others above, this experience finally makes sense.
<|endoftext|>I have considered this very thing. In fact Jesus is where I began. I was raised very religious and my faith in the universe is strong. I fast 5 days a week for the entire day, only eating one meal at night, and speak out loud to the universe. Speaking out loud seems to hold some power and asking questions out loud while entering the trance will start a synchronizing of events in your life. Answers to your questions will begin showing up. There is much truth to religious tenants such as prayer, and the laying on of hands. Anyone can be a "prophet" with the right training. Jesus, in fact is the light and life of the world. The Sun of God. The celestial being bringing the light and defeating the dark. This is sun worship. A modern spin on the oldest religion on this planet. The sun dies on the cross. This is recorded by astronomers. Not to say anything negative of your beliefs, it just seems like the begining for you. If you continue on this path and dont draw a line, thinking that you know the ultimate truth then many things will be given. Ask and receive, seek and you shall find. Never stop asking. Especially when you beleive you have found the entire truth. No greater truth has ever been spoken, except maybe that love truly conquers all hate. Even our galactic prison gaurds cannott prevent love from overcoming. Once we break the veil it is more difficult for them to reapply it to our next life/lives.
<|endoftext|>I had the realization at the time that when my mind was disconnected in a way from my senses, my mind, for lack of a better word, was able to perceive something other. I don't know what the fuck it was, but it seemed very real though intangible. There were other trips where I only perceived the world around me in strange ways, but twice it was different. So I'd have to say that both are real and not really separate somehow. Crazy.
<|endoftext|>*Babylon, the harlot, the prostitute, the whore*. Encompassing the Vatican, the catholic church, the city of Rome itself. All roads lead to rome. The octopus tentacles that stretch to all other nations that have committed adultery with the harlot.(1) - Babylon is mentioned specifically by name by Peter writing from a church in Rome.* **1 Peter 5:13** - "She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son."(2) - The whore (woman) of Babylon that rides the beast is specifically described in Revelation as being a "great city"* **Revelation 17:18** - "And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.(3) - Rome is synonymous with being the city of "Seven Hills (or Mountains)"* **Revelation 17:9** - "**This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated**;"(4) - in Revelation 18:17+ it speaks of sea captains being able to see the destruction of Babylon that is brought about it in ONE HOUR. The vision given is of an angel throwing a giant boulder sinking it into the sea. The talk of ships alone rule out the possibility of it being Babylon of old on the Euphrates (if you had any doubt), but it certainly makes sense considering the [proximity of Rome]( to the sea in addition to all the goods/wealth it trades in. It's destruction during the Tribulation will easily be visible by the smoke that engulfs it.(5) - Finally, going back to the vision given to King Neb. in Daniel 2. The reign of the "gentile kingdoms" began with Babylon of old as represented by the golden head. Followed by medes/persians, greeks, east/west rome, and eventually the revised roman empire of the 10 toes (kings/nations). It began with Babylon. It ends with Rome. *Spiritual Babylon* has persisted through each kingdom. Is it not a perfect poetic ending to be the destruction of the "great city" itself?(6) - Final finally, just look at the state of the Roman Catholic church that exists with its worship of idols, protecting of pedophiles, lust for greed, power and the false Jesuit pope that is desperately trying to "unite" major world religions (islam, orthodox judaism & whatever they call christianity) in preparation for the united world religion that will come onto the scenes during the Tribulation period.
<|endoftext|>Its comment history was a few phrases repeated over and over in every single one of their posts. Is karma farming a thing?
<|endoftext|>I'm certified with the national guild as a consulting hypnostist. I specialize in past life regressions, but also help with fears, smoking, weight loss, pain management with your physicians approval. In my state you actually do not have to be certified to practice at all. It's a shame the bad rep hypnotism has, especially in America.In England and a lot of Europe, most hospitals have lay hypnotists on staff to help with healing, recovery, and pain management. Also Many many professional sports 'team psychologists' are hypnotists as well.I don't expect to gain any support or traction here with MKultra and what not, but there is a lot more going on with nefariously programming people then mere hypnotism.

<|endoftext|>I'm sorry but I do not have that trust in a doctor, let alone your average yahoo. I've met bad doctors.Funny how many there are. Don't get your panties in a twist with yer downvoting- I didn't downvote you, pal. In the end I really don't give a shit what you think. All I know is *I don't trust doctors* unless they prove their worth. As for Shamans, pfft. I bet I can meet a good one over at [ the Esalen institute.]( 
<|endoftext|>Yes it does. The native americans talked about how when you think of someone it "gives them life again". When you look at or think about someone you are making an energetic connection. You grandmother thought lovingly of you and created a magnetic connection. My grandfather died decades ago, and I am just now reconnecting with him. As we remove the programmed limitations and develop further this will become commonplace. The dead do not have to be forgotten. We can and will create new energetic connections and portals to them. We will not rest until every person alive and deceased has the choice to remain as themselves and truly create their own reality...
<|endoftext|>We're all the same filing cabinet, there's access control, but it's kinda limited.If you go looking for demons, they'll start coming to look for you. You can ask them to leave, some will leave quickly, more powerful ones will be more persistent. Same would presumably apply to spirits/souls. If they want to speak to you, they will. If they want to block you, they may not. It's like an arm wrestling match of wills.
<|endoftext|>Beautiful. Happy to hear you can understand it better. It definitely is not the most tranquil experience it seems. I never had such an intense experience myself. I personally felt paralyzed... Not sure if I didn't reach the proper threshold or what. Maybe another attempt now that a decade has past. 
<|endoftext|>On Lsd, did you get a feeling that another dimension or world was out there, only that it was hard to focus on? I felt as if I could peer into this other world if I relaxed my vision for a while, but when I would attempt to focus to see clearly, it disappears again.
<|endoftext|>Never talked about it, but the one time I took many more shrooms than I probably should have... I walked two blocks from my friends house to my dads house (who also bought some of the same shrooms but was eating like 1 at a time).As I walked under some big trees on a dark night, I felt something watching me... I remember feeling very fearful at first, then overcoming that fear and felt like a being or something opened my mind.At first I was having a hard time maintaining my perception of reality. Everything was so funny, made no sense, and seemed a very different reality from before. I talked with my dad and he looked like a cartoon. I was laying on the couch meditating and I had intense visuals of strange beings, demon like and also beautiful ones that controlled various aspects of reality. My visions were basically of the universe and reality and that a vast interconnected machinery was being controlled by beings or gatekeepers each with a special function and most aware of me and the fact that I was aware.I did not communicate directly with any of these beings, as I was seeking different understandings of reality and thought these hallucinations could be hindrances to my higher enlightenment. However the whole time I felt like a special knowledge was being transferred without words and separate from but explaining the machinery of my mind or the universe. The whole experience in general makes me wonder if I was just reaching a certain point of my shroom trip that I just went from doing good and not feeling much effects to full blown mind exploration, or if I was indeed correct in feeling the presence of a higher spiritual being guiding me through an experience and teaching me.
<|endoftext|>Yes. Absolutely. This Matrix is a PREDATORY SYSTEM on many levels. Like it or not: We are all cut off from the Source Energy. The Archons feed on humans for Loosh Energy. Humans brutally enslave and slaughter animals for their consumption.
<|endoftext|>Fascinating, thank you so much for the reply. I was waiting on it! This is very interesting, I know all about point (6), it is partly what got me interested in reading the Bible. So much pedophilia and cover ups and EVIL out there at the highest levels! Even the Vatican!I am curious what will bring Jesus back, he talks of great suffering for everyone before his return, it will be a 'terrible time pregnant women and nursing women' and nobody will even have time to go back into their homes to get a jacket. I believe it would only take an hour (or less) to destroy Rome.One question: have you heard of the New World Order the globalist elite have been planning for decades? It seems to be coming to a head and I wonder if this is what is destined to happen to force the Second Coming of Christ.
<|endoftext|>Who knows. Seems it was written by someone wanting to tell people they are loved. Weird, but nice.
<|endoftext|>People on this sub that chalk hypnosis up to being MKULTRA are clearly confused; MKULTRA had its origins in NAZI SS, later brought to the CIA through Operation Paperclip.

<|endoftext|>Love this analogy. I can wait to see it play out...but I am looking forward to the adventure some day.
<|endoftext|>Yes, you could describe it that way. I felt as though I was lifted or 'moving upward' through/into something other. Then I saw a white 'room' or space and there were people or beings there and i felt that maybe there were others there like me as well, but when I tried to focus/observe it, I 'fell' out and away from it. Sorry for the vague words but its hard to convey the experience. It was strange. Only happened once that I felt transported in this way.
<|endoftext|>Know that there is nothing that can "force" the hand of Christ to come back at any other time other than that which is appointed already by the Father. The NWO that is going to come to complete fruition during the 7 year tribulation period may think they are running according to their time schedule, but they are not. God has already seen exactly what they have planned, and has told us the future of all these things through His Word. When they go "underground" in their caves and bunkers that have been building for decards, they will be nothing more than billion-dollar tombs for them and all the other wicked serveants of satan.They will fail, they will fall. Including Rome that will be destroyed in a day from judgement from above.All the signs are already here, and they converge in Fall, this very year. The verse you are quoting is from the Olivet Discourse in the Gospels where Jesus is specfiically talking about an event that happens in Jerusalem exactly 3.5 years into the tribulation with the anti-Christ sets up his abomindation of desolation in the re-built 3rd temple (which is already planned out and ready to be built very soon)
<|endoftext|>Well I don't feel comfortable divulging any of my patients past live regressions, but they range from Egyptian high times, biblical times, Raw energy like forms, American Frontier, on and on.I'll share my past life regression a fellow hypnotist guided me through.  I was in Ancient Egypt and my job was to manage food production and distribution. I oversaw the field workers and set up festivals to celebrate our holidays. In our religious perspective, we had great appreciation for Opposites, for Dark and Light, Night and Day, Good and Evil, we held them together in esteem. An essential part of my job was to keep the upper and lower class happy. So over the years, we increased our festivities and celebrations. Then one year we had a severe drought and our crops were decimated. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place, trying to keep the labor class fed while simultaneously appeasing the upper class who had become accustom to a lavish lifestyle and extravagant festivals quite often. Well it didn't end well for me. The labor class stormed my household and destroyed it. My beautiful wife was killed in front of me for resisting. I was taken to the fields where I pleaded for their understanding, offering to work the land with them, but, then I too was killed. So ya, that was my personal experience with past life regression

<|endoftext|>[The Piri Reis Map]( Piri Reis map is a world map compiled in 1513 from military intelligence by the Ottoman admiral and cartographer Piri Reis.There are two major discrepancies from known coastlines: the North American coast and the southern portion of the South American coast. On the Piri Reis map, the latter is shown bending off sharply to the east starting around present-day Rio de Janeiro. A more popular interpretation of this territory has been to identify this section with the Queen Maud Land coast of Antarctica. This claim is generally traced to Arlington H. Mallery, a civil engineer and amateur archaeologist who was a supporter of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact hypotheses. Though his assertions were not well received by scholars, they were revived in Charles Hapgood's 1966 book Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings. This book proposed a theory of global exploration by a pre-classical undiscovered civilization based on his analysis of this and other ancient and late-medieval maps.As far as the accuracy of depiction of the supposed Antarctic coast is concerned, there are two conspicuous errors. First, it is shown hundreds of kilometres north of its proper location; second, the Drake Passage is completely missing, with the Antarctic Peninsula presumably conflated with the Argentine coast. The identification of this area of the map with the frigid Antarctic coast is also difficult to reconcile with the notes on the map which describe the region as having a warm climate.What the Wikipedia article fails to mention here is that the theory is that Piri Reis was using source maps that depicted Antarctica from *at least* 10,000 years ago, so the climate would've been vastly different.Despite consistently [only providing one source]( to "debunk" the Antartica-in-Piri-Reis-Map Theory, the Wikipedia article ends with this statement:serious scholarship holds that there is no reason to believe that the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast.As usual, Wikipedia passes off a conspiracy theory as "debunked and settled" when the jury is very much still out.
<|endoftext|>[Operation Highjump]( Highjump (19461947) was a United States Navy operation organized by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, Jr. Task Force 68 included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. Operation Highjump's primary mission was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV.After a fatal aviation accident, a death from a "ship-unloading accident" and increasingly poor weather conditions, the Operation was terminated early.The enigmatic [Admiral Byrd]( subsequently made the following cryptic statements on his return home:Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States.
<|endoftext|>In Graham Hancock's 'Fingerprints of the Gods', he (spoiler alert) ends the book, which talks about links between many ancient civilizations, with a note of why he thinks Antarctica could actually be the 'lost continent of Atlantis'.Now, I don't have the book in my hands, currently, so these are not direct quotes... but, let me try to summarize.Basically, I believe he said it was one of Einstein's theories, that if there *was* a 'polar shift', 10-12,000 years ago, that it could've been caused by the crust of the earth sliding. Basically, separating from the layers underneath. Hence, why we see 'flash frozen' woolly mammoths and the like. It would've been a sudden, violent change in climate for many parts of the earth. Now considering that we're talking about a pole shift of 15-30 degrees 'off-axis', that doesn't seem like much... until you look at Australia. Australia and Antarctica have very different climates, currently. However, that same 15-30 degree shift could basically move Australia southward to where Antarctica is, currently, while simultaneously shifting Antarctica north (since you can go further south than the south pole), into the range of Australia.I feel like I'm not really doing his hypothesis justice, but it's definitely worth the read.
<|endoftext|>DISCLAIMER: NO SOURCESAfter many a late night conspiracy discussion between me and some of my like minded friends we have come to this conclusion(at least it is one of the more entertaining).Prior to 12000 B.C.E. their existed advanced human civilizations which held much deeper understanding of their place in the cosmos and of the energies which compose the cosmos. Due to some (unknown) event of astronomical proportions the Earth was subject to a major pole reversal triggering the current mini-ice age which our planet is currently undergoing. As human induced climate change (think human impact rather than 'oh no humans gonna kill the planet') has steadily increased as our planetary civilization reemerges from the ashes of our past; in conjunction with shifting of the axis, we are I believe in the transitioning stage of another pole reversal, and soon(if it isn't already taking place). This period where we are shifting back into either an old way or a new way, is when knowledge of our ancient past and the abundance of life will be slowly disseminated to the masses. Using climate change as the guise under which to work, in the coming years (as the global temp increases) expect to see damning evidence of our ancient past and technologies far beyond anything we can currently comprehend or use. It is my belief, and solely mine, that the 'priest class' and the 'elites' have used secret societies throughout history to screen occasional individuals who rise above the masses through either intellect, power, or other means of influence. It is precisely these schools of "esoteric" knowledge which conceals the long known truth that our species contains much greater intelligence and potential than we are currently being educated to believe we have. This 'grand conspiracy' to keep the masses dumb and under-educated is less out of malice and more out of the fact that our re-emerging culture has up until this point, not been ready to psychologically accept the consequences that would come from an ancient advanced human civilization ( to the point which would make our current intelligence and technologies seem like child's play). And that we are now progressing through this transition period where our species can reconnect with our ancient past and hopefully proceed with an enlightened and kind curiosity guiding our species through the Cosmos together. But that was all buzzed hopeful armchair bullshitting. But hey, I can hope can't I?
<|endoftext|>No Antarctica conspiracy discussion is complete with mention of it being a possible entrance to Hollow Earth. The name of the theory sounds rather sensational, but [the evidence supporting the idea is rather compelling]( The Nazis were fascinated with Hollow Earth as well, and I don't believe they would have pursued it as much as they did if there was absolutely nothing to it.What really makes me lean toward the theory is that [other planets and moons in our solar system have mysterious holes at their own poles](
<|endoftext|>I think they are building military bases there that they don't want the public to know about and also that there are visible fossilized remains of pre-dinosaur mega-creatures that they don't want the public to know about.
<|endoftext|>Sup with the area showing a huge gravitational anomaly ? If you were a philanthropist wouldn't that be a top notch site? For whateverI think its a chunk of the old world, still frozen in time when the rest of the world was wiped clean, from flooding and the receding glaciers. 
<|endoftext|>So called "regular" people will probably never get to explore Antarctica. All public tours and cruises seem to be owned by the same company...
<|endoftext|>I'm always interested in "art imitating life" which seems to occur in many conspiracy theories. Whether this is because theories are a little fictional and borrow from media or whether media borrows from rumours and theories is a contentious issue.However, it is so fcking intriguing that nearly 2 decades after the X-Files movie, the plotline is so similar to many Antarctic conspiracy theories.To even put a cherry on that, those of you who remember the X-Files will remember the "well-manicured man", who when the CIA needed to start a smear campaign against, said, "yes, what is it they are saying this time? Drug user or pedophilia? They say anything and everything to discredit their threats"...this is a real close link to p-gate imo.
<|endoftext|>I'll mostly be a spectator for this interesting topic, but the first thing I think of when I think of Antarctica conspiracy theories is how Werner von Braun took a little expedition down there c. 1967, just a couple years before men were to walk on the "moon" on the Apollo 11 "mission."
<|endoftext|>We know that since homo sapiens evolved, we have been a seafaring species. There is even evidence to suggest that homo erectus had some seafaring capabilities.We know that the global sea level was about 125/150 meters lower than present prior to the end of the last ice age.From this we can deduce that in all likelihood our ancestors explored and settled vast amounts of land that have been submerged or climatologically uninhabitable for the past 12,000 years. Ancient human settlements in Antartica seem quite plausible, if not probable.
<|endoftext|>Where to start...Our sun is in a binary orbit with another star, Sirius, creating a roughly 26,000 year cycle in which it moves from lower energy to higher energy and back again. (Actually a trinary system with the Sun and Sirius A orbiting Sirius B, best I can tell, but it's simpler to visualize just a binary system.) This energy level affects all species' level of consciousness, but there will be one new dominant species, or "root race", per cycle -- humans, this time around.Here's a quickie primer:- [A Shortend Version of The Great Year, narrated by James Earl Jones]( just at the beginning of the new Great Year, just leaving the darkest age -- the Kali Yuga or Iron Age. I suspect we're still being ruled, at a planetary level, by the dominant race of the previous Great Year -- call them the Atlanteans or Nephilim. More specifically, it's the Satanic faction of that race, the Angelic faction having long since left our planet to explore space. Would you rather serve in Heaven... or rule in Hell?So in short, I think the Satanic faction of the Atlanteans are ruling the planet from a hollowed out area under the Antarctic ice.Kubla Khan - Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1798) In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree: Where [Alph, the sacred river]( ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea. ...That ice is now melting, and they will be exposed. There is supposedly a lot of activity going on in Antarctica now. I suspect the Deep State is throwing a military shield up for them, now that they're losing their cover.They use advanced technology, developed in their Great Year cycle -- and some held over from previous cycles -- to rule over us, staying one step ahead. I believe Silicon Valley is their outlet to re-develop and release this technology to the public at a measured rate, as it benefits them -- from cell-phones to electric cars.On a side-note: I'm starting to suspect that all this [crypto-currency activity]( is, essentially, R&D for their new one-world currency and blockchain technology that will tokenize every aspect of life and utterly enslave us into a New World Order. And here we thought we were throwing off the chains of banks. *I-rony!!*Will the Angelic faction return to rescue us? Was [Rush's *2112*]( prophetic? Stay tuned!----Lots of speculation, for sure, but a lot of things have clicked into place for me. Like the whole Giza pyramid complex makes a lot more sense now -- they were trying to tell us about Sirius! Anyhow, It's a fascinating area of study that has really reshaped my view of history. Here's a longer playlist if you want to dig into this stuff:- [The Growing Earth, Yuga Cycle, Sirius B Connection]( hope this makes some sense and that others can modify or extend some of these ideas.
<|endoftext|>Does anyone believe Hitler escaped to Antarctic? I watched a conspiracy show on Netflix about how the nazis had a secret Antarctic base. Show also cited artic marine training as secret attacks on said base. 
<|endoftext|>So I have read that in Operation Fishbowl they tested high altitude nukes. There is a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica and it is attributed to global warming. Why is Operation Fishbowl not ever mentioned as the reason for the hole?

<|endoftext|>My theory on this Antarctica "conspiracy" is popular fiction has, over the years, seeped into the sub-conscience and as a result people jump to wild speculation about simple scientific or tourist trips to the continent. Sorry to poop on your parade. check this out. this one. Ice Station by Matthew Reilly And Raising Atlantis by Thomas Greaniais
<|endoftext|>I have shitcanned the direction of this sub over the last year but this is a really good initiative. /u/axolotl_peyotl 
<|endoftext|>12 countries originally signed the Antarctic treaty now it has 53 countries. If you look at images of we're the bases are(probably not acetate) they secure the entire Antarctic zone and the surrounding waters around the continent. Why do you think they need tanks down there? Permanent bass and a no go zone for civilians? They either keeping us outta there or they keeping something from coming to our continents. Idk but I want to go and take a peek if you ask me.
<|endoftext|>My thoughts on Antarctica are ..Since all the countries have nukes pointed at each other this would be a perfect place for the elite to wait out a nuclear holocaust. 
<|endoftext|>These round tables are the best thing to happen to /r/conspiracy in a long time, really entertaining to read through just to hear all these wild topics 
<|endoftext|>So what's up with the weird wave anomalies coming from the area recently? I also wonder if there really are nephilim trapped / imprisoned under the ice. 
<|endoftext|>[Here is something I typed up some months ago about Antarctica]( like to go back through and make it a little bit more coherent, but the main gist remains the same. Since writing that I've become entirely more convinced that there most likely **are** ancient ruins under the ice in Antarctica. Graham Hancock's extensive compilation of work identifying an ancient advanced civilization is impeccable. The most likely place for Plato's Atlantis has to be an Antarctica that was probably in a more tropical climate about 13,000 years ago.I still think that the recent hype around it was manufactured to some degree - Antarctica would be the perfect place to begin a Disclosure process via some ancient artifact.
<|endoftext|>I don't believe this, but here's a fun, totally speculative theory (related to the black goo one): Anyone see that movie Life (w/Jake Gyllenhall and Ryan Reynolds)? SPOILER: At the end, the alien life reaches an Earth ocean. Let's suppose something like that (or, of course, the creature from The Thing) landed in Antarctica (lucky for us). Not 10,000 years ago, but maybe like 5-20 years ago. It's been growing, absorbing other life, but possibly at a slower rate due to the cold--maybe its been hibernating. Or it's been growing constantly, yes, but its still decades away from being large enough to spread/be a real threat. Maybe there are secret research teams there attempting to figure out how to kill this thing or stop it from spreading further (again, think of the creature from "Life" or the black goo from Prometheus if you prefer).
<|endoftext|>I wonder if we'll ever find out just whats going on in the Antarctica?Can some wealthy dude not fly a drone over the ice wall to see if there really is hidden land and an ancient race of people.
<|endoftext|>[Jesus you guys are a little late to the bandwagon huh](
<|endoftext|>I just pulled this out of my ass and take it for what it is. They discovered what seemed like human activity that resembled advanced technology for it's time. They can't mechanically get to it, so they are ego-engineering to melt Antarctica to reach these ancient settlements. This also has a side benefit of melting the Northern Arctic which they plan on exploiting the new access for oil and gas. They didn't count on melting the permafrost and releasing tons of methane - or did they because it would accelerate their motives. The Nazis knew about this somehow, and now we have this "treature trove" of Nazi Artifacts in Argentina. The Nazis went to Argentina because it was also close to Antarctica. The super powers of the world each received a portion of the "brain trust" from the Nazi era. Those Brian Trusts are dying, and they are rapidly deploying new technologies that they have mastered before they are all gone. Now that the last survivors of WW2 are physically dying and taking secrets to the grave, all their technologies that have developed and been suppressed will be unleashed, including Tesla and Einstein. 
<|endoftext|>I was browsing Hollywood movies from the years '47 to about '53 using primarily Wikipedia and discovered two or three movies that had similar themes about discovering otherworldly stuff in Antarctica. One of the movies was later remade into John Carpenter's *The Thing* but an earlier one was really intriguing and about something like a military base under the ice. I'm too lazy to find links now but there's an interesting very general trend about increasing numbers of sci-fi movies produced from this period onward where previously they were basically nonexistent. Wikipedia's movie lists by year aren't comprehensive though. It might be an interesting project for film historians. There were probably some interesting TV and radio sci-fi shows too but I'm not curious enough to compile a list of them at the moment.

Keep an eye out for news articles slowly dropping more and more hints at the fact that there's a lot of shit down there we haven't been told about.Last time I dove into this conspiracy, there was a lot of evidence that an ancient civilization lived there, and another cool theory that Nazi's fled there after WWII, meaning that we didn't actually win the war. I'm at work so I can't really track down links, but [this video]( sums it up nicely.
<|endoftext|>SERPO ALIENS SAVED U.S. FROM NAZIS BUT OUR MILITARY CO-OPTED & HID FREE ENERGY & SPACE TECHNOLOGY Hear Kasten Interview at   WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, NEW MEXICO: Just after sunset, runway lights flooded the runway where President Johnson and fifteen of his highest military and civilian bosses saw the disk from our ET alliesthe Ebespop in and settle down. Our people knew already regarded the Ebes as allies; theyd saved us from the Nazis in 1947 when we feared the Nazis in Antarctica would strike America with fighter disks like those they used to beat Admiral Byrds armada in the Antarctic battle of the Weddell Sea. The disks the Ebens helped us develop warded off a Nazi invasion.Now, in 63, a tall, lanky extraterrestrial humanoid, Ebe2, emerged from a hatch; she wore a coverall dark blue bodysuit. She was here for a four-hour visit. Ebe2 announced in English that she had as gift to Earth, the Yellow Book. The Yellow Book, she said, shows the viewer all Earths history and the history of the galaxy as well.Len Kasten, in Secret Journey to Planet Serpo writes that as Ebe2 and the Americans spoke a screen in her translation device showed a printed form in both Eben and in English. She read the form aloud in English.Her two flight companions loaded their craft with the nine bodies of the Ebes whod died in the Roswell and Kingman scout-disk crashes and landings. They also loaded the body of Ebe1, the mechanic whod survived one of the crashes. Ebe1 had helped us contact Serpo and arrange for the exchange program, Crystal Knight, that would bring twelve Americans to Serpo in the Zeta Reticula system, 240 trillion miles from earth. Ebe2 said she and an Ambassador would return to Earth in two years. The Ambassador would remain and help the U.S. for twelve years while twelve Americans lived and study on Serpo.The meticulously documented record of the exchange program Kasten gives us in Secret Journey lets us see proof of the exchange program and the Yellow Book? President Kennedy made it happen.The Ebes had been helping us since 1947, in a program run by President Eisenhowers MJ 12 Committee and the Nazi-infiltrated CIA. MJ 12 included the deep throat whistleblower who put the story on the web. Kennedy wanted to cut off Allan Dulles, a Nazi sympathizer and the CIA chief (which was rife with pardoned ex-Nazis) from the Serpo Exchange Program. Kennedy felt the CIA had marred his presidency with their failed invasion of Cuba. He wanted the Serpo exchange program to be his triumphant legacy. And he wanted the program out of the hands of Dulles and the CIA. So Kennedy created the Defense Information Agency to take over all defense coordination. He charged the new agency to, as much as possible, share to our governments agreements with aliens and the technology they shared that could improve life on Earth. Thank Kennedy and his DIA for the documents and leaks to the website www.serpo.org.The website leader, probably a member of MJ12, wrote,The Yellow Book is an 8 x 11 inch object 2 1/2 inches thick made of a clear, heavy fiberglass. The border of the book is bright yellow. When the viewer puts his eyes near the book and the device reads his electromagnetic aura, images appear, as do words in any of the 80 human languages the viewer uses. Pictures tell the story of the Ebes lives, their exploration of the universe, their planet, their societal life and the Ebes longtime relationship with Earth. The Yellow book showed their first ambassador to Earth, some 2000 years ago, was Jesus.Get more of the story at   
<|endoftext|>Since polar shift is a reality, and both poles are known to move location. Can we ever be fully sure of Antarctica as a whole? There is land below the ice which is probably stupid rich in minerals. On top of that the #1 spot of all magnetic anomalies has to be at our poles. Which means Antarctica is folly to some bizarre things. Plasma induced mysteries we are far from understanding. Antarctica has yet to be claimed right? So does that mean the next war will be for the Holy Land of Antarctica. Which could melt away all that Ice, and be the biggest treasure of this era? 
<|endoftext|>I dug thru a whole bunch of Army, CIA and DIA FOIA releases about Antarctica from the 50s and 60s and 70s. From what I gathered there didn't appear to be anything of quantifiable value down there... it was more like all the secrecy and hubbub about Antarctica arose from the fact that Antarctica exploration was viewed as an equivalent of the "Space Race". People were using it to show off the technological and scientific prowess of their various nations. USA was worried USSR would actually find some use for Antarctica and it would be embarrassing for US. There was a bit of worry that USSR could find a strategic advantage down there via surveillance since all other forms of military were banned via treaty. Later on in the 80s there was some talk CIA about how they thought Soviets used Argentina as a sock puppet to take the Falkland Islands to secure a shipping route by sea out of Antarctica for coal exports. 
<|endoftext|>For sake of argument, let's say there's something hidden in Antarctica. Now what? No one here is going to do anything but pat themselves on the back and post youtube footage. : Shrugs: 
<|endoftext|>The superpowers are probably just trying to divy up any resources that have been discovered under the Ice.
<|endoftext|>It looks that a [big chunk of ice]( from Antarctica broke away, one of the biggest ever recorded. I wonder if it is somehow related with the supposed digging there..
<|endoftext|>One of the most interesting concept was that U-boat would follow a river from the coast going under the ice until they reach a small lake that might have a hot spring that would cause a dome to create above the lake. 
<|endoftext|> Trough"A deep trough immediately W of The Bulwark, through which a part of the Koettlitz Glacier formerly flowed N to Walcott Bay. Named by the Victoria University's Antarctic Expeditions (VUWAE) (1960-61) for its proximity to The Pyramid."Yes that is mcmurdo next to it. 
<|endoftext|>Is it not suspicious high ranking and religious people are visiting there and every country Flys a flag and gets along there? NK has an Antartic research base there along with US,Russia and a few others but the NK base has heated toilet seats and a nuclear barge for breaking ice better than the US . They all work together to research. Check out some youtube documentaries. There's also VERY clear footage people took flying in a helicopter throughout antartica...way clearer than Google Earth lol. Its a beautiful place and I believe there's definitely something there worth researching.Edit:spelling
<|endoftext|>Dynamic area of charged "particles": vortices surround the Earth:
<|endoftext|>Google actually uses airplanes for most detailed mapping. They use satellite imaging for the poles. Many of these satellites are in equatorial orbit so they are taking images at very acute angles and laying them over the globe. That's part of why it's so glitchy looking, at least the innocent reason. -I really wish we could see more detailed image mapping of the poles. There are polar orbit satellites but they're mostly military or for weather satellites that don't do image mapping. 
<|endoftext|>I am VERY late to the party on this topic. I would like to make a quick reading suggestion though. I have also spend a great deal of time looking at maps and reading about Antarctic history, conspiracy, and legends, and if you get the chance, read "At the Mountains of Madness" by HP Lovecraft. First of all, it is a pretty quick read. Second it NAILS the real geography of the area for at least the first 3rd to half of the story. Finally it actually introduces a LOT of the legends and conspiracies that people have historically associated with Antarctica, which is impressive considering it was written in 1931 (thus no Nazi stuff).That story runs the gamut from Lost History, Hollow Earth, Ancient Astronauts, to Genetic manipulation causing the creation of modern man. It was also that story that kicked of my obsession with Lovecraft, and led him to be one of if not my favorite author. I can't advise that one strongly enough. It is also in the public domain, so you can get it for free in ebook without much effort.
<|endoftext|>I spent two weeks trying to find good, detailed imagery of Antarctica and finally gave up. This, when supposedly the ice caps are melting and going to kill us all, so we'd better keep a close eye on it. Fuckery is afoot.
<|endoftext|>Many of these aren't in Antarctica. One is definitely Russia, and a few others look like Arizona or Nevada. 
<|endoftext|>Almost nobody will benefit from clear images of that region, this is why google "tried their best" with the data they have. I want to say to any 'conspiracy researcher' - you will never find any good data from Google or any other company that provides mapping data - from these kind of regions. It just doesn't make any business sense.Google (which uses atlas and a number of other sources as far as I know) does their best with this limited data, blocked out regions are not secret bases, they are simply not mapped enough to provide a suitable image for their business services. It's fucking simple. The only way to get the data you want from these regions is if you put a satellite out there which can consistently and accurately map those specific points. It'll cost you - but it's not prohibited in any way (as far as I know). (edit) There are, now that I think about it - some areas that are "blocked out" or scrambled because of governmental interference or interaction, but you will never browse Google Maps, or any other map thing online, and find alien craft crashed or whatever, you will never find that. That is a dead end, I assure you.
<|endoftext|> I'm obsessed with Google earth and I'm constantly looking at Antarticaman if you're really like that, you may have enough motivation to check [this](
<|endoftext|>Its because the Earth is flat and they have to create the "continent" of Antarctica through heavy editing.
<|endoftext|>Wow any idea what those are in the first photo? Bulldozers? If so that is a massive excavation project.
<|endoftext|>Thank you for linking all these, this is an area of great interest to me.An aside, I think these table discussions are a good thing. +1 internet.
<|endoftext|>I like this one the best:  source is this subreddit..
<|endoftext|>Links arent working now, i think server crashed. I was able to read a couple before they all went down.
<|endoftext|>The glowing orb article is kind of BS.... if you google image the pictures and click through them all you can the orb was being rolled around and if you look at about 20 diff pictures you can see all the continents. 
<|endoftext|>Damn it, hoping for a shred of evidence of anything damning. This is a list of rumours and speculation, thoroughly disappointing. 
<|endoftext|>I'm pretty skeptical of the Antarctic conspiracy but you made my night wth all these sources to read over. Always interesting either way
<|endoftext|>I know I may be a bit late to the party but do you happen to know another source for the new videos of the German Antarctic expedition? They've been taken down and from what I can tell scrubbed from the internet. Would love to watch if anyone has those videos or knows where to find them!
<|endoftext|>There is definitely something afoot in Antarctica. I speculate that, as you said, before the cataclysmic end of the last ice age around 12,000 year ago (10,000 BC) Earth's climate, sea level, and general landscape were quite different and therefore contemporary cultures and civilizations may have had knowledge of the Antarctic continent and even settled there. I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge. That being said, we need to let go of the Piri Reis map as the golden idol of evidence on this matter. It takes 1 minute for any objective person to do a side by side comparison of a modern map versus the Piri Reis map and see that all the distinct coastal points sloping to the east of the Piri Reis map are simply the capes, bays, and peninsulas of modern Argentina drawn without proper calculations of the Earth's curvature. There are countless examples of Piri Reis's cartography showing this same problem.To reiterate, I accept the premise but not because of the Piri Reis map. We don't need the map. We have the climate models and projections of global temperature and sea level that prove a multitude of continent sized land masses (Atlantis, Lemuria, Yonaguni, Bimini, Sri Lanka, Australian land bridge, Antarctic land bridge, etc) were above water prior to the cataclysmic end of the last ice age. This map is one of the things that our detractors will associate with us because it is unprovable. We should stick to the empirical data when discussing this turbulent time period. 
<|endoftext|>If you're into the equally interesting "Expanding Earth" conspiracy, the problems concerning the displacement of South America and other surrounding areas can in fact be explained and wouldn't have been inaccurate on the Reis map but the map itself, or the original it came from would have been much further back in time than has been speculated. Although the whole vid is worth watching the situation with Antarctica is shown at 1:40 into it.
<|endoftext|>Why do Wikipedia articles just love to have that tone of "nothing to see here, all disproven" on anything slight contentious 
<|endoftext|>e: I can see in later posts you agree it's likely the map is simply incorrect.Yet, if you read the [debunk source]( it's exceptionally concise and removes the need for further debunk sources.We can see the Piri Reis Map bears no resemblance at all to Antarctica. The 600-mile wide Drake Passage is not shown, nor are the large islands in the Weddell Sea. The latitude is thousands of miles off.When something is wrong, it's wrong. No confusion about it.
<|endoftext|>Doesn't that come off as him attempting to solidify support for a second mission, and validate expenditures and deaths?
<|endoftext|>Wait wait wait. You're telling me Einstein believed it could have been possible for the entire outer crust of the Earth to slide over the mantle and literally flip upside down, quickly enough to flash-freeze a mammoth?What the fuck?
<|endoftext|> Prior to 12000 B.C.E. their existed advanced human civilizations which held much deeper understanding of their place in the cosmos and of the energies which compose the cosmos. Why don't we detect any remnants of this civilization in ice cores from that time?
<|endoftext|>tldr: Current Human Supremacists can't admit advanced civilisations existed prior to our amazing "technological revolution".
<|endoftext|>It's a nice dream. I'd prefer to imagine our top human contributors as cautiously wise individuals than ignorant greedy, idiotic, malicious parasites.
<|endoftext|>What do you make of the inner earth theory? I've been fascinated with it for a while now, and decided to devote today towards researching. Seeing your post was a really cool sync.I watched this documentary yesterday, which introduced me to professor James Hurtak. I haven't heard of him before, but his information seems pretty on point. He's a shadowy figure though... if you google him, there's barely any info, and even a couple articles bashing his credibility. I'm starting to think that his name has become deliberately sanitized within the truth seeking community, because of how close his research came. His books are also priced insanely high on amazon, which is very suspicious, as if steering people away. He speaks of 7 points of power on our planet, where pyramids / other ancients structures were built, which are entrances into inner earth:  then stumbled across this video, of an apparent gateway into inner earth, via one of the poles:  its credibility aside, if you search for Sunil Lama in the comments, he's a Nepal native who comments how knowledge of these entrances was passed down to him from his grandparents. He also mentions 7 entrances, so this is knowledge from oral tradition, which verifies James Hurtak's work.EDIT: Found out today that the gateway vid was a CGI project (not surprised), but the fact that inner / hollow earth entrances are spoken about in ancient oral traditions of native people is very intriguing to me:  fact that pilots are always ordered to fly around the poles is also extremely suspicious. I just listened to this interview of a naval officer telling his story:  intend to make an organized post about this at some point, but am still researching. I also read Admiral Byrd's flight logs / story, which blew me away. That holes in other poles article you linked to is fascinating btw, and adds more fuel to this fire. What do you make of it all? Personally, I think there's something to it, and am seeing all the connections now... deliberately shifting attention to a flat earth debate, creating more division, which buries all discussion of an inner earth, inhabited by highly advanced civilizations. There's a lot of buzz around Antarctica lately, but whenever the inner earth component is brought up, it's harshly countered by flat earth chatter. As I research inner earth further, I'm seeing the FE mechanism / psy-op with much more clarity.EDIT: A new Dark Journalist interview with Joseph Farrell, about Antarctica / Admiral Byrd, just uploaded recently. Looks like it was a good time for me to dive into this, the synchronicities are piling up...
<|endoftext|>This all looks like BS to me but its entertaining enough that I will likely read this entire thing. I'm curious to how I feel after reading it. 
<|endoftext|>The Nazis were fascinated with Hollow Earth as well, and I don't believe they would have pursued it as much as they did if there was absolutely nothing to it.a) hollow earth was never party doctrine and never really a topic in the third reichb) even the party doctrine were often pretty bullshity - like dismissing relativistic physics because tehy were jewish..
<|endoftext|>I think you're right, but I also think it's within the realm of possibility that there are remains of ancient.... something. 
<|endoftext|>There ain't no huge gravitational anomaly in antarctica.. maybe you are thinking about India? 
<|endoftext|>I consider myself pretty regular. All I did to explore Antarctica (and sail the north pole) was join the Coast Guard. Outside of the service, it isn't too difficult to get a job down there either. The work is seasonal which is a turn off for a lot of people. Very few crew winter over.And by all means fund yourself a private expedition. I would not consider tour lines exploration in any case.The opportunities are out there you just need to pursue them!
<|endoftext|>Ancient human settlements in Antartica seem quite plausible, if not probable.Except it's cold as shit, and you can't grow fuck-all there. I could maybe imagine an Inuit-like people living there living a subsistence-level existence eating marine life, but good luck erecting anything at all impressive without the surplus generated by agriculture.
<|endoftext|>There is a Uboat that clearly dropped off Nazis in Argentina before surrendering. He may have been on that sub. Stuff They Dont Want You To Know did a podcast on this recently. 
<|endoftext|> There is a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica and it is attributed to global warming.No it's not, it's attributed to the use of CFC's in aerosol and other applications. After CFC's were banned in the 80's the hole started closing immediately, though it's still thinnest down there. The ozone hole and global warming are two completely different issues.Why is Operation Fishbowl not ever mentioned as the reason for the hole?I mean, Fishbowl was in the Northern hemisphere, and we have a pretty clear causal mechanism around CFC's that predicts that hole quite well. It's not really a mysterious thing.
<|endoftext|>How could anyone justify blowing off a nuke in space? Let alone the oceans like they did. I could see it being symbolic in a couple ways
<|endoftext|>Wouldn't it be easier to just file them as working for some normal domestic entity and obfuscating their travel logs?
<|endoftext|>Well, I've actually read both of those books you mentioned in your comment and in no way had related them to the current Antarctica conspiracies.Those are fiction. It is fact that there is a huge land mass under the Antarctic and it is a given that their will be something unusual under there. Be it gigantic ocean beast fossils or ancient civilisations - there will be something truly amazing underneath 10,000 years of ice. It is nonsense to say otherwise, i just hope the secrets are out before i move on from this world.
<|endoftext|>Not as esoteric as nephilim, but your comment reminded me of this story:[Forgot your concerns about CERN: NASA probes detect very low frequency bubble around the earth]( the comments:My guess is the Antarctic is where these large VLF transmission stations are located.Scientists have just finished an enormous neutrino-detecting apparatus in Antarctica, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. With appropriate pre-planning, wouldnt this installation make a dandy cover for a huge VLF antenna, frozen into the ice?
<|endoftext|>Something I thought of regarding the island plato described as atlantis, found beyond the "straights of hercules". What if he was referring to the continents of north and south america being one side of the straight, and europe and africa being the other? Beyond that? Antarctica. Plato also says "in the days when the atlantic was more navigatable" more advanced ships maybe? And that atlantis was massive, greater than "all of libya and asia". I think he had a different definition of how big asia was but hey, that's still pretty big. Antarctica fits the description.
<|endoftext|> Graham Hancock's extensive compilation of work identifying an ancient advanced civilization is impeccableExcept for the complete and total lack of genetic evidence in our DNA to indicate what he says happened actually happened. The migration patters he puts forth simply don't show up when we do DNA analysis.
<|endoftext|>To be honest, the seemingly random uptick in sci films is probably a direct correlation with the increase in quality of props and special effects.
<|endoftext|>Chile carved out a pie slice of Antarctica and claims it as their territory:  Chile is the UFO capitol of the world. 
<|endoftext|>Despite lack of documentation supporting the idea Antarctica must be a treasure trove of natural history. All kinds of space debris including meteorites, asteroids, and even comets should be there. Crap falls from the sky and is layered by the ice sheets indicating chronology of these events. If you found a crashed UFO anywhere else you might assume there could be more of them in Antarctica, perhaps with preserved occupants.There was a wave of UFO sightings at scientific stations in Antarctica during '65On Tuesday, July 6, 1965, the Argentine Navy released the following statement to news media about the sightings:"The Navy garrison in the Argentinean Antarctica, Decepcion Island, observed on July 3 at 19:40 hours local time, a giant, lens-shaped flying object..." continued:  check out Deception Island with Google Earth. It looks like Captain Nemo's submarine base. "This island's harbor is the caldera of an active volcano, which seriously damaged local scientific stations in 1967 and 1969." (wikipedia). Someone posted a photo of their yacht anchored there under the caption Hot Water.
<|endoftext|>Exactly. Space Race 2.0. General power projection, Total Spectrum Dominance or wtf. CNN(Anthony Bourdain) just did a show there and it was ALL about painting it as an established, decidedly American outpost, run by savvy quirky American scientists just doin innocent sciency stuff and "roughing it" (with shipped in fresh produce and various other luxuries that are probably taxpayer funded). 
<|endoftext|>We start a kickstarter to fund a private expedition there. And/or we gain enough momentum to convince a semi-well known researcher/explorer to go there/fund it partly himself/herself.
<|endoftext|>If they've got real satellites up they the. Why havent they ever set up a live stream? This would settle the whole flat earth debate. Just have one satellite actually zoom in on a person live and show him from the ground and space. There are NO SATELLITES. Editing Google Maps happens when they stitch together a bunch of airplane / drone images to make it seem to be a sphere. NASA even admits that is how they generate composites for Earth.
<|endoftext|>Just the amount of military presence raises a few eyebrows. Funny national geographic July copy is on giant Antarctica creatures. definitely not what we were told it is... I read a crazy book called "worlds beyond the poles" and not to mention General Byrd interview about his findings.
<|endoftext|>Are they tanks? I thought they were some kind of plough or something. The part that extends off is T shaped. I've not seen any tanks with T shaped cannons.
<|endoftext|>tldrWeird people have been visiting Antarctica under even weirder circumstances as of late:John Kerry (at the height of the 2016 POTUS election), Buzz Aldrin (who was evacuated), Russian Orthodox Patriarch of Moscow Kirill III...etc.Also, there *may* be something to a post-WWII Nazi presence in Antarctica.Wild stuff.
<|endoftext|> Trough"A deep trough immediately W of The Bulwark, through which a part of the Koettlitz Glacier formerly flowed N to Walcott Bay. Named by the Victoria University's Antarctic Expeditions (VUWAE) (1960-61) for its proximity to The Pyramid."Yes that is mcmurdo next to it.
<|endoftext|>Awesome response...thank you for demonstrating why these round tables kick ass.That being said, we need to let go of the Piri Reis map as the golden idol of evidence on this matter. I agree completely and only referenced this because it's one of the first widespread "conspiracy theories" regarding Antarctica (along with Operation Highjump).One of my favorite books on this subject is called *Axis of the World: The Search for the Oldest American Civilization* by Igor Witkowski if anyone is interested in alternative histories.I'm eagerly looking forward to when the true history of the last 10,000 years or so is completely rewritten.
<|endoftext|>before the cataclysmic end of the last ice age around 12,000 year ago (10,000 BC)I hate to be pedantic, but I feel it needs to be noted that we are still in the current and fifth known ice age, [the Quaternary glaciation]( Ice ages proper are periods lasting millions of years and characterized by glacial ice sheets in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Each long-term ice age generally goes through periods of relatively colder or warmer climates, called glacials and interglacials respectively. Glacial periods are referred to popularly as "ice ages," hence some of the confusion. The last glacial (the Pleistocene) ended ~12,000 years, giving way to our current interglacial period (the Holocene). We're still in the ice age. 
<|endoftext|>Maybe they're prepping for harsh global warmer by prepping the colder parts for prime habitation?Also, I used to have a fascination with maps from that period, and they are all inaccurate, especially so in the remote inhospitable areas.
<|endoftext|> I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge. Why do you think they're trying so hard to keep this information from us? I've often wondered about this. 
<|endoftext|> I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge. Could you elaborate what "grand implications" could possibly be? Whether it was once a thriving continent or it was always a cold wasteland, it's certainly the latter now without question. What could be gained by having said ancient knowledge, let alone withholding it?
<|endoftext|> I also accept that the ruling class of our current iteration of civilization are keeping this knowledge from us due to the grand implications of such ancient knowledge.What implications?
<|endoftext|>Ive literally never read anything about expanding earth theory but the gist of it sounds plausible to me tbh. The universe is ever expanding so it stands to reason that everything contained within the universe would follow suit
<|endoftext|>Very into it. And the Growing Earth concept ties into the Great Year -- higher energy = higher consciousness = more planetary/solar growth. (Explains why all the ancient cities and monuments are constructed using morter-less, polygonal block constructions -- with the Earth growing at its maximum rate, violent earthquakes were a common occurrence!)I didn't mention Growing Earth here, as the comment was long enough already, but it's very relevant:
<|endoftext|>Whoops, sorry... He merely provided the forward to Hapgood's book on crustal displacement theory: [Wiki](
<|endoftext|>IIRC humans have been in approximately modern form for around 300,000 years. It doesn't really seem all that likely that we never bothered organising ourselves for the first 280,000 years. It seems logical that we would have established societies, probably many different ones, over the millenia. How advanced though... that's another question. I'm not sure I buy much into the idea that they were heavily advanced. [This]( article describes evidence of extensive lead and silver mining/smelting during the Roman era, which I found interesting because I didn't really expect it that early.The authors state that they couldn't analyse a period of time (which in their sample was between 3,500 - 7000 years ago) because the core sample was brittle ice, which prevents measurement of heavy metals. Which naturally leads to what I assume would be other ice-core problems: the pollution needs to be widespread enough for the metals to reach areas where ice is fairly permanent and enough snowfall needs to occur to seal it in (if ice melts, pressumably a lot of the metals would run off with it. The geographic centers of prehistory cultures would likely be a lot of different to todays because of the differences in climate and sea level, which is (IMO) the biggest issue. If a culture was present at a time when the climate was colder, they would likely not have been in Europe, probably more likely to be as close to the equator as possible, which means any industrialised pollution (unless of a huge scale) wasn't likely to make it to the Artic or Antartica. Sure if would have been trapped in some ice, but that would have melted off as the planet warmed. Even in the case of the pollutants reaching the surviving ice regions, it'd have travelled a huge distance and be pretty dispersed reducing its detectability further.Sea level would have been much, much lower (100 - 200 metres lower). Human societies seem to thrive best when closer to the ocean. The ocean provides food, fresh water runs down through rivers to it, trade is easier etc. The crux of this issue though is the same facing us right now: we built all our best shit right next to the water because of the economic and agricultural benefits. Even 20,000 years ago the sea level was approx 120m lower than it is today. If early human cultures did the same as what we all did, then chances are all the evidence we would need to see has been underwater for tens of thousands of years. Hell, if there was a culture around 140-160k years ago, it would have spent a good 120k years underwater, come back out as another ice age hit, and then be submerged again. Assuming *anything* of those settlements survived the erosion they'd be encased under thousands of years of sediment.So really... on such long time scales I'm not sure that evidence of existence would have been discovered at this point. 
<|endoftext|>What kind of evidence do you think would prove their existence? Are you talking about physical archeological evidence or data from the ice cores suggesting a sort of industrial revolution 13,000 years ago? The latter would be very difficult to detect. Or maybe there was an intelligent highly technological civilization that didn't alter the atmosphere like we do today. 
<|endoftext|>If you would please specify what exactly it is you mean by remnant and I would gladly theorize more for you.
<|endoftext|>I, like a few others, don't really understand your question. What would ice cores tell us about a previous civilisation? If you mean in terms of emissions and such, previous civilisation did not use a lot of the technologies we have today that create these pollutions. So an ice core sample isn't going to show any evidence of human civilisation or settlement because that's not really the sort of information an 'ice core' stores. 
<|endoftext|>Excellent research! Thank you!Did you see the latest bit of Meme Magic? Published in 1893, *[Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Adventures]( is a story narrated by "Don Fum" ("Drumpf?") about Baron Trump's journey to Hollow Earth via an entrance in Russia.I'm convinced there is *something* to this theory.
<|endoftext|>iirc reasoning to not fly directly over the poles is because its longer than flying around, plus I imagine if theirs a disaster it would be harder to recover them from deeper in than on the edges. 
<|endoftext|>Good point but inner earth could equally be a psyop to deflect from flat earth. But the fact is both could co-exist as indeed could globe earth with inner earth of course. But antarctica is key in both inner and flat earth
<|endoftext|> dismissing relativistic physics because tehy were jewish..No, im pretty sure it was because relativistic physics makes no intuitive sense; rather, the reality and philosophical claims which spawn from the math have never been proven; just theorized from sound mathematically models. But yes, I can hear you already! At some point we may need to abandon our intuition favor of data. But there is no data on the relativistic claims. At least in the sense of its quite outstanding claims on whats *really* happening to moving matter:  1) shrinking length in its moving frame (has "the pole in barn paradox" *actually* been verified) 2) gaining mass in its moving frame (example, compress a spring and it gains mass) 3) time slowing in its moving frame (more reasonable is that some subset or all of matter's processes slows because its interacting with an environment) - (Has the travelling twins paradox actually been observed, or just radioactive particles falling through our atmosphere?)Simplified yes, but all emerges from relativistic physics. Yes? (Correct me please if im mistaken)So yea, im pretty sure its just a theory, and regardless of the scientism propaganda, one would be pretty wise to not accept it as fact. The math is fine, I can personally attest to that. Remember the map isnt the territory...

<|endoftext|>No, I think that's one of the reasons we don't allow it anymore, I think? I might be wrong but I think there's some kind of UN agreement. That and underwater I think
<|endoftext|>I forget if it was Carl Sagan, or someone of the like, who said that space is the only environment win which the power of a nuclear explosion can be harnessed creatively instead of destructively. This is due to the expansiveness of space and the abundance of its resources. Anyone remember this quote?
<|endoftext|>Right. The military knew what they were doing. Operation Fishbowl was named because we are under an impenetrable force field. Doesn't matter what shape Earth is. Nothing can leave the Fishbowl without the permission of God. Sorry space nerds. I use to want to be rocket ranger as well. 
<|endoftext|>So you aren't familiar with the Antarctic UFO base conspiracy? You either didn't read the Matt Reilly book or you have difficulty connecting the novels premise to the Antarctic UFO conspiracy. I stand by my theory that most people "Want to Believe" and will grasp any mainstream conspiracy to confirm their wild imagination. By the way, there are several other authors who have written about secret UFo bases on the continent. 
<|endoftext|>What is the point of this Very Low Frequency antenna? Why is there a "bubble" around the earth made of a VLF? What does that mean and what does that do? Prevent us from receiving something?
<|endoftext|>Got me thinking - Using a blast or melting method to form a gigantic Arecibo style radio dish in the ice is a fantastic idea. 
<|endoftext|> My guess is the Antarctic is where these large VLF transmission stations are located*The United States Navy utilized extremely low frequencies (ELFs) as radio band and radio communications. The Submarine Integrated Antenna System (SIAS) was a research and development effort to communicate with submerged submarines.[22] The Soviet/Russian Navy also utilized ELFs for submarine communications system, ZEVS.[23] The Indian Navy has an operational ELF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base to communicate with its Arihant class and Akula class submarines*The various military ELF facilities are located in the countries that have them which include the US, Soviet Union, and India.

<|endoftext|>I actually don't believe that anything fell. Supposedly they've been tracking it for some time, yet there is no footage of this giant chunk of ice sliding off. You'd think they'd want to get video of that.
<|endoftext|>The "Poles" are real, dynamic places and there is, actually, a toroidal vortex going in-and-out of the Planet there.
<|endoftext|>My entire career in the military involved satellites and equipment needing them as sources for timing and location. Granted the technology exists where computers tell you were they are, but we also have back up measures like slide rulers with coordinates to determine exactly where in orbit they are located. There's a bunch of them out there, some only seperated by a few degrees if looking from earth (line of sight). We can shoot a telecom link full of info (up to gb of data) up to the satellite, and see it returned to us, processed by the satellite's equipment. Little bit of info. Most communication/GPS satellites have a 725mhz beacon beam thats always being transmitted (unencrypted) which we tune our equipment too in order to align our antennas so that we can achieve the best signal to noise ratio.
<|endoftext|>Yeah that would have been pretty cool.In spite of the enthusiasm of the talent, it is a REALLY hard sale to get a studio to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a property they could never really own. 
<|endoftext|>T shaped bullets do almost double the damage of "l" shaped ones, which of course do 20x the damage of a bullet bullet. It's science.
<|endoftext|>Do any of those sources talk about the Ark of Gabriel possibly being transported down there, by any chance?
<|endoftext|>I think it's more likely it has something to do with oil/natural resource deposits being discovered, or the C-larson ice-shelf rupturing. 
<|endoftext|>Not really. It was only broadcasted on the Mcmurdo cctv though and it only got out because someone at the station recorded it and uploaded it. He does mention that there really is no evidence of man made global warming though. He says that they are there to fond the evidence.
<|endoftext|>I'm eagerly looking forward to when the true history of the last 10,000 years or so is completely rewritten.You mean revealed. It has already been extensively rewritten :-)
<|endoftext|>By "silicon-based world trees", I'm assuming you mean something like this? I think the Flat Earth part is disinfo.) The giant trees fit in well with the Growing Earth theory -- lower gravity means taller trees (and giant skeletons and megalithic structures). And look where Antarctica was, compared to the South Pole, 65 million years ago -- it was damn near equatorial! love to hear more about your ideas on Antarctica and history. Lurking your user history is a dead end. ;)
<|endoftext|>Heh, this corresponds with my believe that a celestial object passed by earth, pressing out magnetic field and our atmosphere in, lie a bubble, but it didn't pop, but what was exposed to the vaccum of space flash froze, and things not bolted down, who knows what the fuck happened to them. 
<|endoftext|>They cant predict the weather next week, what makes you think they can predict "harsher warming" when the current warming data has been proven to be falsified through "data temperature adjustments"
<|endoftext|>The apex of wealth and power leaves those wanting only more power. Things that encourage equality: free energy, education where one learns to think instead of memorize and conform, peace, etc are not things that ultimately grant you a net increase in power at that stage. 
<|endoftext|>I've heard the theory that there are frozen structures and relics there that would completely rewrite our history. Evidence of a prehistoric society that reached or exceeded our current technological level
<|endoftext|>This theory is HUGE expansion. Pangea was basically like the skin on a tennis ball. Water beneath the land increased the earth's diameter and the continent broke apart. Oceans kept growing, diameter kept increasing, space between continents grew.My stopping point is, where did all the water generate from? Has to come from somewhere. Or maybe I understand the theory wrong,
<|endoftext|>The ice age ended ~11,700 years ago and we've been generally warming since then (with some cold/warm blips). 10,000 ago was right at the beginning of this warming trend. Antarctica had even more ice than it does today. 
<|endoftext|> The latter would be very difficult to detect. No it would not. Chemicals and such not found in nature haven't been detected in ice cores from before the time of humanity and have been detected since. Or maybe there was an intelligent highly technological civilization that didn't alter the atmosphere like we do today. They would have had to have mined which would have left traces they would have also have had to have rose to that level which would have left lots of traces.
<|endoftext|>Increased levels of materials and chemicals not found in nature. Such traces can be detected today and have not been detected in any ice cores before the time of humanity.
<|endoftext|>Actuall flying on a polar route from say London to Tokyo would be quicker than flying out East. I am a travel agent and years ago I took an IATA exam for flight routings and pricing etc. The PO polar route was always cheaper and quicker than the EH eastern hemisphere. A lot of airline fares were calculated on that and sold on that basis. Whether they flew it or not I dont know. But food for thought
<|endoftext|>Yup, I've been contemplating all the scenarios, even watched a really out there vid of this dude who combined flat / inner earth, claims we're living under a dome that's surrounded by water, not space, and that the stars / planets are luminescent objects floating in this massive body of water our planet is submerged in. Not recommending this at all for info, but just to get a taste for some bizarre speculations that are out there: honestly say, that the more I look into it, the more cognitive dissonance forms in my mind. It would be nice to believe in something fully, but there's always the possibility that it's all a psy-op, injected into our mass truth seeking consciousness, having us endlessly discuss / divide back and forth. I'm convinced that the only way we can get real information (other than psychic means), is through actual clearance / raw intelligence cables, but that probably won't be happening any time soon. There are mythological connections pointing to inner earth though, so that gives me hope that it's real.
<|endoftext|>No, im pretty sure it was because relativistic physics makes no intuitive sense; rather, the reality and philosophical claims which spawn from the math have never been proven;Naw, you are pretty much completly wrong.. hmm, where to start?a) Every theory is just a model, a describtion of the world - therefore there won't ever be a complete proof of a theoryb) Before relativistic physics the leading theory was the aether theory which is even more unintuitive.c) relativistic physics were developed as an answer to experiments which showed the aether to be wrong - the most famous is the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887, 30 years before the formulation of Einsteins relativity theories. d) This theory holds up excellent in the macroscopic world - there is almost no doubt that it holds "true" (or at least far better than the aether theory).The offical wording in the 3rd Reich was actually "jewish physics" even tough the best german physicists were all relativistic physicists..I won't answer to your questions unless you really want to know because everything you wrote points to the fact that you didn't even bothered to spend and hour reading about physics before being so pretty sure..

<|endoftext|>Coincidering there's credible documentation to assume Hitler did flee to Argentina and Argentina being one of the easier places to reach Antarctica, I'dd say the 2 (Hitler fled to Argenatina/Hitler fled to Antarctica) are pretty much synonymous, or atleast for the conspiracy-part of me. (I'll **settle** with just Argentina for now, and just theorycraft the rest)The Russians also [told us there's alot of things our governments -NATO- didn't tell us.]( combined, I find it very fascinating, at the very least.
<|endoftext|>There were a lot of detriments to nuking the atmosphere: blinding people, emp effects, killing animals. I think it also had an effect on the ozone layer, but dont quote me on that last one. 
<|endoftext|>Well your point is invalid because i have read the book - i did not jump to your wild conclusion and i don't think it is the reason others would have either.The fact that 10,000 years of ice covers an area nearly twice the size of Australia...There is something fucking amazing that surely was a part of our ancestors lives underneath all of that ice. Most likely ancient civilisations - you are speaking of fringe theorists when you speak of a secret UFO base.

<|endoftext|>One of my best friends uncles owns a few coal mines. All over the world. I lived with him in Vancouver for 6 months once and he told me his company funded a research trip to Antarctica to look for coal. They found heaps down there but the quality of the coal and the difficulty of extraction made it not financially viable to mine. He was telling me the rules there are so strict his team was given a specific diet because you cant bring your own food there, weighed upon arrival, told to shit in a bag for the duration of the expedition and then weighed when they left and they get fines if they leave any poop behind.
<|endoftext|>I dont know about elsewhere, but winter in Michigan has been weak for several years now, most of tge last decade. Arent there mucho icecap meltage going on, already drastically reduced?
<|endoftext|> where did all the water generate from?My understanding: From aether, prana, proto-matter that fills up all the "empty space" around us and accounts for all the missing "dark matter". It's just an electron and a positron in a bonded pair, but because there's no net charge, it's undetectable to instrumentations. Under certain conditions in a strong magnetic field, it can be busted apart and form a hydrogen atom, helium atom, or heavier elements such as nitrogen, oxygen... Put hydrogen and oxygen together and you get water.That's why, IMO, the theory has been suppressed for so long. It essentially tells us water is renewable, oil is renewable, and "free energy" is a real thing.
<|endoftext|>in the bible, it is stated that during the Flood, huge fountains opened up from the ground and water poured forth. so it shows that rainfall wasn't the only contributing factor to the global flood. And if you're into hollow earth theory, the water could have been from the oceans inside the earth. Interesting enough, Jules Verne's *Journey to the Center of the Earth* also had these huge oceans inside the earth.
<|endoftext|>September 18th 1947, the USAF was formed, split off from the US Army when the National Security Act was signed by Truman. Lots of things were created that year.Interestingly enough to me. Most patents tied to our computerization and data storage can be traced and linked back to the companies owned or tied to people involved with Roswell and the beginnings of the USAF.
<|endoftext|>I would argue that there may easily have been a pre-historic ancient civilization, (similar to the one that existed in ancient Greece during it's Golden Age), that could have been based strictly on intellectual development and the acquisition of knowledge **strictly for it's own sake** without applying it for any form of material gain or advantage over nature or others; or the pursuit of technological conveniences or the crass commercialization of such developments simply for private profit.In our own world at this juncture knowledge is *only* pursued and sought out strictly for those reasons or explained and taught strictly in terms of them. In short any pursuit of knowledge *strictly for it's own sake* or to elevate our minds and extend our powers of thought to a higher level isn't a goal that is even recognised nor are any of the possibilities that kind of a focus and dedication might reveal and provide in terms of "mind over matter".The Greek Parthenon sits upon a single piece of rock, four feet thick, that's half the size of a football field. Despite the ancient Greeks predilection for geometric perfection the building that sits upon it with an overpowering sense of perfection to it, is anything but "perfect". It is, in fact, almost three feet higher on one side than it is on the other and the rows of columns that support the roof are all subtly altered not simply in their height but from what would also have been a perfect alignment and distribution. Had they done so, however, the building would have been technically perfect but it wouldn't have "looked perfect" due to parallax and other optical disturbances that would have occurred if they had. It's impossible to say how they could possibly have known all that in advance without building a technically perfect one and then taking it all apart and re-building it so as to make "look perfect", instead, yet there is no indication that they did anything but directly and deliberately construct it "precisely" the way it is. Moreover there is a far higher degree of knowledge and precision in the way it was subtly altered to be that way than if all the measurements had been as precise and equal as they visually appear to be without actually being that way at all. There are similar instances with some of the most beautiful statues of the human form that were created in the same period that aren't, in fact, anatomically correct, either, but derive their overall sense of perfection and beauty from the addition of muscles humans quite simply don't have. I suggest you think about the kind of mental and intellectual focus on the "ideal" and rendering it's sense of perfection by avoiding the pitfalls and limitations of adhering to what would constitute a form of physical and technical perfection that would nevertheless fail to actually give any real impression or sensation of actually being a perfect form of any kind. A mental ability to capture the "inspiration" and translate that as precisely as possible and the power it has to genuinely uplift the mind and spirit. An altogether noble and entirely human ambition that has been lost to antiquity.
<|endoftext|>Let's say this was an Ancient Rome level of civilization 13,000 years ago, not a post-industrial level civilization . That would be impossible to detect chemically in ice core samples. 
<|endoftext|>I'll admit that is very true, however I would suggest that they may have found an alternate source of energy that we haven't unlocked which doesn't require unnatural radioactive isotopes as you suggest.
<|endoftext|>Yep I agree with what you are saying. There is a lot of noise which just serves to distract everyone. I dont know either way to be honest with you but have read a lot about both and think both could be possible. What we need is a revolution and we take over the map rooms ;)

<|endoftext|>Interesting response.You completely missed my point, especially considering "youre completely wrong"And, no, the aether concept is not unintuitive (interwoven "space-time" is about the most unintuitive it gets) nor has all potential aether theories been disproven, not by Michelson and Morley or any other. If you think so, please lay out your case instead of parroting things you heard elsewhere. (Just be sure you first know all of the viable aether theories) This theory holds up excellent in the macroscopic worldNo, im positive we've never proven the three bullet points (essentially length contraction, mass and time dilation) I enumerated. Just blind faith assumptions that the helpful relativistic math is reality. **In other words, is time actually slowing in the muons reference frame, or is its atomic processes (decay) being affected by the environment?** You think the scientists know?And ive officially studied modern physics (which included relativity) in school and on my own time. Whats your experience with relativity?---The only thing you may be right about is nazis mentioning Jewish physics. Regardless, the nazis had plenty a reason to not take the claims as reality, just as I lay out here. It makes more sense this is how the blaspheme started and it got watered down to "Jewish physics" (kinda how most people know very little about anything, yet are nasty and opinionated, yet sometimes right without knowing why) but I may be wrong. Havent looked into nazi german physicists rebuttals.

<|endoftext|>It's impossible to say how they could possibly have known all that in advance without building a technically perfect one and then taking it all apart and re-building it so as to make "look perfect", instead, yet there is no indication that they did anything but directly and deliberately construct it "precisely" the way it is. It's almost as if they could "draw" or "plan" in advance. I mean we can do that, but impossible that they could have.....right?
<|endoftext|>Should also mention technological advances in Eastern ancient civilizations such as Ancient China. There are artifacts found such as swords and armor where modern techniques aren't able to replicate how they forged such items. As well as pyramid-like structures also found all over the place in Western China. There are some tombs made of material in which archeologists can't break into despite even using explosives.

There is no need to move away from relativistic physics because it explains the behavior of the universe better than any other model we have. If you have a better model share it. Second point is a variation of the first: Reality is just that. Reality. But that won't help actually decribing the universe. Are Newtons gravitational laws actually true? Who knows, but things fall down on a pretty regular basis so probably yes. No scientist, no human *knows* they *assume* and in the best of cases they actual have a rational argument to back their assumption.

<|endoftext|>I don't mine Ether, personally, but as I understand you need a fairly intensive setup to make money against the electricity you're spending.Personally, I'd just go buy some :) Price is really low right now due to the crypto market dipping, and speculators cashing out, but Ethereum's technology hasn't changed. IMO, although I'm not a trader and don't know markets, we're looking at what is the very beginning of Ether's rise. A few years from now I think it'll be worth quite a bit more than it is today.
<|endoftext|>I've got news for you, we don't predict and don't calculate for any purely optical effects that might result from making any architectural structure as precisely as we can which is why many modern buildings are less impressive than they were intended to be or appeared as if they would be on drawings and scale models. In fact we have a difficult enough time simply trying to build them as planned, as any architect can tell you.We can't even build an ordinary house 50' long without it being out of alignment by at least a few inches and having to jigger the roof to compensate for all of the corners being out of whack by at least that much. The Great Pyramid of Egypt by comparison is out by far less than a quarter of an inch across any of the four corners of it's incredibly immense base. That was discovered and confirmed by using a laser transit to measure them and the angles they form which means the that whoever built that huge pyramid had some way to not only measure them with that same laser-like degree of accuracy but to actually execute and build it just as precisely which is something we still can't do. All modern buildings, no matter how much effort is put into making them as precisely and accurately as possible are always out of alignment and the bigger they are the greater the discrepancies that eventually result. They aren't noticeable due to the scale but many large office towers and major structures are out as much as a foot or two from corner to corner and that certainly isn't planned but it is generally anticipated because it's just that likely that it will invariably be out of line to some extent. You merely *assume* and *think* that we must be as capable or more capable than some ancient humans and the remarkable precision of measurement or execution some of their artifacts bear witness to but we quite simply aren't, nor do we actually expect that from any of our own endeavours. We seek neither perfection nor any appearance of it and if we achieve anything close to it it's invariably accidental. We strive only for that which is "good enough" or "nice enough" for our purposes, and those purposes have nothing to do with reflecting any form of "perfection" that we either have or seek to express as actually being the primary goal in creating any of them. Now you can't predict the view from any approach to the Parthenon that necessitated making one side of it three feet higher in order to have it appear perfectly perched on the heights above the city except by being at and observing it from all of those numerous approaches and locations; or the spread and positioning of all of the interior columns that hold up the roof to correct for the parallax effect a technically perfect arrangement and alignment of equally sized and spaced columns would have had on the human eye, not just from one, but from looking from any position across, through, upward, and beyond from anywhere *inside* of the actual building itself. That is no small accomplishment, I can assure you.You would quite literally need a model you could walk around inside of in order to do that. Like I said you would have to actually build it to size in order to correct for the all the various optical distortions that all of the columns were subtly and "perfectly" adjusted to compensate for. It's not simply a building, but a rather unique and profound "work of art" of the highest order and an extremely important one, at that. Moreover, it was built by "Idealists" in pursuit of the most "Ideal" form to express that ambition, not the cold, calculating, hard core "realists" seeking to run our own society and world that neither have nor want anything whatsoever to do with that.

<|endoftext|>Perhaps we are getting somewhere...

There is no need to move away from relativistic physics because it explains the behavior of the universe better than any other model we have. If you have a better model share it.No!!! I am not disagreeing with the math. Me: The math is fine, I can personally attest to that.  Remember the map isnt the territory...Read it! Damn it, just read it!I'm arguing specifically that the math isn't reality. There are multiple mathematical models that are correct in many domains. Multiple ways to solve equations. But when we finally start applying math to reality, there is really only one thing that is happening. (Quantum physics is really quantum statistics, please though, let's save that for another time, until we sort the current issue at hand...)'Tis similar to the interpretation to what relativistic physics tells us. In it's words. In it's philosophy.  The theory beyond the math is what has and probably will always bother me if someone doesn't just go ahead and figure out how to built the tool that cheats the universes circuitry (measures the current unmeasurable aether) while you could probably find a equivalent aether theoryYes, here you actually admit that just because the math is right, doesn't mean some other math might also be right but conflict in terms of how the reality machine really works.  But that won't help actually decribing the universe.It's actually the next step beyond Math. Describing the universe. Especially if you still believe what you said just before (while you could probably find a equivalent aether theory.) Since if that's true than why shouldnt we say aether theories reality model for the world is the right one. It simply conflicts with relativistic interpretation (time dilation, length contraction etc are real phenomenon) Space distortion is so far backed by the experiments, time dilation as well (e.g. Hsches experiment in Germany).I actually have not heard of this and am looking into it now. I get a bad feeling about this. Would you be open to talk about potentially why this experiment doesn't actually do what you are saying it does? Proving space distortion and time dilation, that is. Because again, if you've read me, you would recall the muon. Some say it proves time dilation as well. But if you still believe that, you're sorely not comprehending what I'm explaining.

Woerner, and T. Elsaesser, MaxBom Institut, Berlin, Germany    Abstract  The ultrafast dynamics of organic dye molecules in solution are studied in temporally and spectrally resolved experiments with 30 fs pump pulses resonant to short-wavelength S0Sn transitions and 20 fs probe pulses overlapping with both the S0S1 absorption and emission bands. Around zero delay, a pronounced coherent signal occurs with sign and amplitude depending on the spectral position within the probe pulses. The coherent coupling of the type electronic transitions is due to the coherent vibrational motion induced by an impulsive Raman-type excitation in the electronic ground state. The molecules promoted to Sn states give rise to a fast ground state bleaching on a 50 fs timescale that is followed by the picosecond onset of stimulated emission after accumulation of the excited molecules at the bottom of the S1 state.Is it this one you are talking about? We just have the abstract (paywall) but 20 femptosecond is an awfully fast frequency. Crazy stuff. The thing is, it's in a chemistry journal or something of that sort. Why wouldn't this explicitly mention that it was the first to "prove" some dilation is *really* happening? A little help here? And actually, you should update the Wikipedia page while you are at it!
<|endoftext|>If i look back on my nerdy childhood with a gnostic perspective i find alot of messages about this knowledge in videogames.Story of the moon that creates a special gravity on earth deforming all creatures (morning of the magicians, horbiger theory of reality)? Final Fantasy 8, the lunar cry.Theory of godliness really being controlled by parasites that keep it up for their survival and gain? whole story of FF10.Alchemic theory? pretty much all final fantasy to 6, with a lot of hiddend hints at the occult here and there.Hell i even suppose on the long run this became an actual plot to hide ancient knowledge.Now if you simply google an ancient deity name, you get the wiki and then 10 pages on videogame's characters or pngs with that name. It's a pretty effective counter measure, and mostly unsuspectable.
<|endoftext|>This topmind user who's beaking you obviously has no clue how special the great pyramid is. There's no machinery in the world that could get those stones to the upper portion, weighing over ten tons. Also, 2 sides of the pyramid when looked at from ABOVE on the summer and winter solstice, show a perfect indent, making the pyramid have more sides. So they also included cosmology into their build. 
<|endoftext|>Are you seriously suggesting that as a group humans are incapable of building or planning as accurately as the ancient Greeks or Egyptians?Do you think the Hoover dam was built to less tolerances than the Pyramids? Do you think a nuclear power station or CERN are built less precisely than the Parthenon?Just because we build some shit buildings along the lines of "that'll do" does not mean we are less capable than the ancient Egyptians or Greeks. I'd be surprised if the ancient Greeks or Egyptians could have built Notre Dame or Santa Maria del Fiore  they were built around the 1300's. They are far more complex and precise than either the Pyramids or the Parthenon and yet were built without the aid of post industrial equipment. It's nice to imagine that the ancients had some secret building knowledge, but they didn't. Not to take anything away from them, what they did was remarkable, especially considering they were starting from first principles, but we have gone forward not back from them, standing on the shoulders of giants as it were. Maybe we have lost some of the beauty and majesty (I don't think we have, we just have to build more and quickly) but to suggest we are in some way incapable of producing something of equal complexity is flat out wrong, it was even wrong 900 years ago.I've got news for you, we don't predict and don't calculate for any purely optical effects that might result from making any architectural structure as precisely as we canYou think this wasn't done deliberately for optical effect?
<|endoftext|>1) friggin typo. Not Hsch but Hnsch (why results in Hnsches experiment) Sorry!!! which scientists? And/Or you?Me.

Since if that's true than why shouldnt we say aether theories reality model for the world is the right one. It simply conflicts with relativistic interpretation (time dilation, length contraction etc are real phenomenon)We are humans and thus limited in our abilty to observe the universe. We will never, ever be able to fully describe the universe (you could argue that goedels incompletness theorem is the the logical proof for that assumption) but we are (hopefully) able to find a minimal set of functions which describe the behavior of the universe. No more, no less. Would you be open to talk about potentially why this experiment doesn't actually do what you are saying it does? Proving space distortion and time dilation, that is. Because again, if you've read me, you would recall the muon.  If I may bring an example: Within classical physics something like a black hole was absolutely possible - simply a star with a gravitational pull large enough to recapture light. When Schwarzschild proposed black holes within relativistic physics Einstein was opposed to the idea and wouldn't accept it for quite some time. For the observer of a black hole the difference is pretty much negligible.Some say it proves time dilation as well. But if you still believe that, you're sorely not comprehending what I'm explaining.Again: Something like an absolute proof will never be possible. But by now,.. could you tell me *which* part of relativistic physics irks you so much and why? What is it with space/time dilation that makes people so unhappy?
<|endoftext|>This is what "irks" me most:No need at all to pronounce that matter is literally shrinking, mass is increasing and that time is slowing, all due to difference in relative velocity.Just acknowledgement the math seems to be a solid fit is good enough. The philosophical implications of the math are not proven, just assumed as true (the above); and the model is naturally set up in such a way such that transforms ensure there is no mathematical contradictions. 'Paradoxes' can be resolved mathematically, but have never been shown to actually happen - ex: two humans (biological organisms) aging differently due to relative velocity/acceleration, yet its a common "textbook" example.If I understand your post, you may agree. Thats my point, more succinctly. I'll keep it short because id like to know your response directly to that.
<|endoftext|>Well it looks like some conspiracy fellow from the old times found a way to cash the knowledge in for good...Anyway good one, i forgot about that. To think of it, ff4 was really deep with hollow theories, the earth too.
<|endoftext|>That's a good attempt to make you sound smart, but I don't think Aristotle was implying that every story someone comes up with should have time spent on it. There is no trace of a pyramid in my garden, dismissing my neighbours claim that Egyptians once built one there does not mean I have an uneducated mind. The opposite in fact.
<|endoftext|>Thats my point, more succinctly. I'll keep it short because id like to know your response directly to that.My response is that time and mass always (well, till the mid/late 19th century and then again due to relativistic physics) have been relative. Using days to count time already means accepting a non-absolute time between two dates, if you weight the same rock at two different places on earth you will usually get a different weight. It was just for a relatively short time that we believed time to be absolute. Furthermore our concept of time, length and mass is quite arbitary - there may be some sort of absolute norm in the universe but why should it be something like the oscillations of a caesium atom?If we go a step ahead and take a look at (quantum) vacuum oscillations we again reach something like a aether-look-alike with the disturbing consequence than there may be no absolute vacuum. Honestly something like a relative time/length is far easier to accept for me than something like a sub-zero Kelvin temperature ( which turns around everything I learned about thermodynamics.Back to the twin paradox: Just take (chemical) reaction kinetics, where the speed of the reaction is a function of electronegativity, temperature, etc. Coming from this POV another variable like the relative speed of the system is nothing to freak out about. :) 
<|endoftext|>I especially like how the Lunarians come from a destroyed planet once in orbit between Jupiter and mars. Or how Cecil and Goblez's father came from the "Red Moon" but was killed by the humans.Lots of great story spawned by theories of the time.
<|endoftext|>I can respond in more detail but I think your whole post misses the premise of **space-time** linkage. The claim is that moving in one reference frame affects time and space depending on the observers reference frame. Your example about dates is irrelevant here, I dont see how the decisioms made behind calendar years, days whatever has to do with what "irks" me. Explain more if youd like. Your example about gravity is beyond irrelevant, since obviously weight is variable. But mass was not considered variable until "relativity". Variable based on reference frame at least, and in a closed system.And finally, by using a chemical reaction as an example, you entirely ignored my premise about the muon and how its unreasonable (without evidence) to think that if it applies to the muons radioactivity then it must apply to human aging. I don't have a problem with the word/concept "relative". Plenty of things only have meaning when taken relative to something else. My issue is in the reality interpretation of special relativity.Youre all over the place, it seems.
<|endoftext|>There's a lot more interesting things about the moon's dimensions as well, much of which was known by ancient monument builders who made the pyramids at Giza as well as Stonehenge and many other sites.For example, the ratio of the Earth's diameter to the Moon's diameter is 11:3, or 7920:2160 miles. This ratio produces a phenomenon known to ancient geometers as squaring the circle. If you made a circle with a radius of the Earth's radius, plus the moon's radius, then that circle would have the same perimeter as a square drawn around the Earth: if the Moon were touching the Earth, then you could draw a circle with it's center at the center of the Earth, and it's edge passing through the center of the Moon, and that circle would have the same length around it's edge as a square perfectly enclosing the Earth. This relationship is illustrated in the great pyramid at Giza in the ratio of its height to its square base, and in the concentric rings at Stonehenge.This relationship would not be there if either the Earth or the Moon were a little bit bigger or smaller, and is even more amazing when you realize the significance of measuring these dimensions in miles. The ancient approximation of pi~~11/7~~ 22/7 is reflected in the radius of this large circle encompassing the Earth and the Moon with radius 5040 miles, or 7! (7x6x5x4x3x2x1) and the diameter of the Earth (or one side of the square) with length 7920 miles, or 11!/7! (11x10x9x8). So whoever came up with the measurement of the mile clearly had this relationship in mind.There's even more significance when you start to look deeper into the cosmic patterns of the universe, but the moon is just the start. Our ancient ancestors who designed not only the length of the mile, but also the foot, meter and cubit had these cosmic dimensions and ratios as their basis, as explained so well by Alan Greene, who recently did an AMA. True, the moon is amazing, but once you start to study the deeper patterns in the cosmos and the sacred geometry all around us in nature, it becomes clear that the moon is simply one of many amazing "coincidences" of proportion that seem too perfect not to be designed. My personal feeling is that the underlying structure of our universe itself is beautiful, fractal harmonic relationships, and as a result, everything in the manifest world reflects that.
<|endoftext|>I put this thread together for /r/conspiracy a few years back:[A Little List of Coincidence in the Solar System]( Space, Geometry and the Golden Section. Do the planets hide a secret Harmony of the Spheres?
<|endoftext|>Astronomer [Tom Van Flandern]( and others have argued that there used to be a large planet between Jupiter and Mars (where the asteroid belt is today). Mainstream science doesn't entertain this possibility because there isn't a natural mechanism for the literal "explosion" of an entire planet.Van Flandern, undeterred, traced back the paths of scores of comets in our solar system, and discovered that many converged at the same time, and at the same location, at two points in the history of our solar system, with the most recent being approximately 2 million years ago. Other writers like Joseph P. Farrell (in his book *The Cosmic War*) offer a *technological* explanation for this major event, namely that this large, potentially earth-like object was *deliberately* destroyed, and even more hypothetically by a weaponized moon in our solar system.Van Flandern took it even further by speculating that "the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded "Planet V"."In support of this theory, some ancient cultures have lore that tells of ancient humans originating on Mars.If this interests anybody, I highly recommend reading *Dark Matter, Missing Planets & New Comets* by the late Van Flandern. He has an entirely new approach to gravity that honestly is quite stunning in its simplicity and implications.
<|endoftext|>The Hollow Phobos Hypothesis has significant evidence to back it up, which is a problem because, paraphrasing Carl Sagan, there isn't an accepted *natural* explanation for a hollow planetoid.[The Phobos Monolith]( is also the subject of significant speculation.There has also been a curious history of failing equipment each time we get close to this enigmatic moon...
<|endoftext|>One thing I often wondered about was the difference between the Earth's 24hr day and our biological 25hr clock (put people in a room containing no natural light nor clocks, and they will naturally have 25hr sleep/wake cycles.) What if some time ago the earth had a 25hr day, and some astronomical event slowed it down. That would explain why our clock is off. But when did it happen, and was the moon involved?

<|endoftext|>The Moon has 99% been a part of (or in the vicinity of) Earth since it's formation. The decay of the Helium isotopes matches up which means that the Helium atoms on Earth and the Helium atoms on the Moon have been close to each other since just about their formation. Another way of putting it is that both sets of Helium have experienced the same amount of time in the universe, which can only mean that they have travelled together. This is all pretty concrete and is the reason why the impact hypothesis is the currently accepted theory.UNLESS, the moon landings never happened and the "Moon Helium" is in fact terrestrial.

<|endoftext|>Here is something relevant I posted a couple weeks ago. **NASA VIDEO EVIDENCE of the astronauts faking shots of "Earth at a distance" during the Apollo missions, while they were still very much in low Earth orbit.**Because once you realize that we may have never passed LEO, questions about the moon become much more valid. Another angle of thought is that we went to the moon, found out something that was too much to tell the public, so we filmed and faked an alternate moon reality (NASA's moon footage) and have been presenting that to the public ever since.______The following evidence represents an extremely important moment caught on camera that I believe has never been adequately addressed by NASA or any NASA supporter. In my opinion it is equivalent to what the WTC7 collapsing footage is to the 9/11 truth movement.It comes from the documentary A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon but I am not trying to convince anyone of anything from an obviously biased documentary. Be skeptical of all of it. I encourage that. When this clip plays in the documentary there is a narrator but, again, I am telling you to completely ignore that voiceover if it pleases you.Simply use your eyes and use your brain and look at what I am about to show you. I am purposely separating the most important footage from the documentary and its bias, muting the narrator, and breaking the clip up into very short digestible gifs. Lets start.Does this look like the Earth to you? Would you assume that this is a shot from the far reaches of space, looking back at Earth from a distance? convincing right? Lets look at more footage of Earth at a distance: in the camera which we can only assume is pushed up against a shuttle window, pointed out at the Earth in the blackness of space: this shot is even better. Notice that you cannot really make out any continents? Notice that you see no stars? But for the sake of argument, lets just completely ignore that for now. Take a look: mean, thats definitely the Earth right? And you would have to be far beyond Earth (on the way to the moon) to get footage like that, correct? Again, no recognizable continents, No stars. But again, for the sake of argument, lets allow science to explain that.But wait, how exactly does this happen?  isnt the camera pressed against the window and zoomed in? Because they are far from Earth right, at least this far, correct? If they zoomed that camera back out. wait a minute, wtf is that? Is that the sun? on. Wut? Here is a longer gif just to make the strangeness very clear. that a work light? Of enormous size and floating in space?Wait a minute, whats going on?  to have your mind completely shattered? Look: wait, what? Yeah, that Earth at a distance was a clever camera trick. They used the circular shuttle window and the small part of the enormous Earth showing through that small circular window. Camera tricks and the illusion of a little Earth ball at a distance.As you can see here, they are very close to Earth. Like Low Earth Orbit close. And yes, that was a work light. You can now see it clearly. And that blackness was a darkened shuttle interior. Again: Or I dont know. I am willing to entertain any ideas or thoughts on this.And let me set the record straight once and for all:Do you personally subscribe to any Flat Earth or alternate Earth models? NODo you believe in the ISS and Mars rover missions? YESDo you believe that you can shine a laser at a retroreflector on the moon? YES, because the unmanned soviet [Lunokhod]( program left retroreflectors there.What about the other evidence: moon rocks, etc? I am not sure honestly, I do not feel like I have studied enough to make a decision.So what are you trying to prove then? I am simply pointing out that there is unusual footage of what appears to be the astronauts filming a disingenuous Earth. I find the footage fascinating and would love to know more about it. I would love to see the unedited footage and I would love to see the extended footage.How do we know this is real NASA footage? Because NASA included it in their Apollo 11 DVD set. Why, I dont know. But people definitely thought that pointing that out would somehow make my brain stop comprehending what it saw.As a matter of fact, [here is a website that appears to be trying to debunk that footage]( scroll to the bottom.This is their explanation:_____What Mr. Sibrel supplies is footage of the astronauts practicing for an upcoming telecast. **Because television was added at the last minute, they hadn't had time to practice much with the equipment. So they were experimenting with different camera positions and exposure settings**. Someone on the ground recorded it. Mr. Sibrel notes several observations which he can't explain in terms of his expectations, therefore he concludes the astronauts "must" have been faking it. That's it. That's his "smoking gun."_____And finally, here is [the TIMESTAMPED section of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon]( if this post piqued your interest. Once again, take everything said by the narrator with a grain of salt. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything other than what their eyes see and the conclusions their brain reach while watching that particular footage that I made gifs from. I personally have a hard time wrapping my brain around what form of context could possibly explain it.

<|endoftext|>Expanding on the "spaceship moon" hypothesis, writer Don Wilson has written several books on the subject.[Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon]( is available to read online (I highly recommend it...I spent over $50 for a physical copy), as well as [Secrets of Our Spaceship Moon]( (pdf).Another popular book on this subject is [Who Built the Moon?](

<|endoftext|>[The ancient time on Earth without a Moon.]( A Moon either being brought here or built here (by an advance Creator(s)) could explain the Great Deluge and the numerous underground dwellings and cities, among the other anomalies of the moon (ie size ratio to Earth, and the pefectness of all proportions - not to far, not to close - just right distance to the sun, etc etc). I have a wacky thought that maybe the souls of Humans (who do not ascend) pass through the hollow Moon, and those who do ascend pass through the Hollow Earth. Hence why they call people "lunatics" and why people act freaky during a full moon in the night (ie. the freaks come out at night).
<|endoftext|>Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun? I personally am agnostic due to the insane amount of coincidences like this but I'd like to know this, because space is a very real and fact (math)-based science.Regarding this: There is no astronomical reason why the Moon and the Sun should fit so well. It is the sheerest of coincidences, and only the Earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion.
<|endoftext|>I really like this article that explains the craters on the moon: Universe all the way.
<|endoftext|>all 4 rocky planets (mercury, venus and mars) could haveonce hosted life. the secret is melting the core. you can do that by simply moving the planet closer to the sunand wait. once you melt the core you get a magnetic field.not only that, planets may be growing in size(look for the growingearth theory) if this is true. mercury may become the next venus.venus may become the next earth. and as we all know earth will be the next mars. the only planet we have left is mars. if we want to make it life supportive we need alien advance technology to move it wheremercury is now. the it will spin faster than it should (einstein solve this)and it may gain back its liquid core, magnetic field, grow a littlecover itself in hot magma, and the cicle continues. thats my theory. 
<|endoftext|>The moon is a Hollow Alien Spacecraft:1)
<|endoftext|>There is also the theory that Zecharia Sitchin puts forth, that the Moon was actually a satellite of a different planet. To parallel the Tiamat vs Marduk story.
<|endoftext|>The moon fits perfectly into the sun. How could that be? Very simple, the thinking about the moon needs to change, stop assuming it is a giant rock, planet, or whatever. Think of it as 'the back of the sun' or a projection created by the sun. They are, in fact, the same entity, but that doesn't mean the moon doesn't have unique properties, such as the ability to cool objects exposed to moonlight. It is not a "place" you can visit, but the sun itself reflected, somehow.
<|endoftext|>Probably should have called this thread "Strictly for Professional Lunatics" lolWe know other planets have moons, both in our own solar system as well as in other systems in our galaxy but absolutely none of them have a moon that is anywhere as big as ours is in comparison to the size of the Earth itself. So that presents a curious anomaly as well as raising an interesting question about how the Earth could have initially attracted and held on to such a large moon when we have no other planets with moons that come anywhere close to being as big as they themselves are as we do and probably shouldn't have been able to do in light of that. That of course leads to the question about what the Moon itself and it's interior is made of and all the conjecture surrounding whether it may actually be hollow or not. Another interesting consideration is whether or nor what we have called and believed to be "craters" produced by meteors, may have actually been the result of some kind of violent and gaseous volcanic activity in the moon's distant past which would look pretty much the same when you look at and think about it from that perspective. You might want to cook and pay attention to a pot of oatmeal to get yourself into the mood for that. lol
<|endoftext|>The moon is what causes tidal forces on the oceans and gravitational pull in the earths core thus keeping the planet alive. I wouldn't be surprised if the moon was the original Noah's ark. Sounds fucking crazy lol

Both are conceptual manifestations of you. Neither entirely exists physically. They are right above you, inside the dome, you are inside your very own plane-ette of experience. The Sun appears as your corona, where a single point of intention to exist meets infinite non-existent potential erupting in bright heated light. The Moon is infinite manifest non-existence, manifest as existence. You are in between your Sun and your Moon on a plane-ette of experience, where all you see or know is self overlain on infinite individualities. All you see or know is your self externalized onto infinity from within a time-space conceptualization that is designed to keep you individual and sane within an infinite non existent conception.

<|endoftext|>Buzz Aldrin on C-Span saying that there are "monoliths" on Phobos that deserve further attention to mention Russia's Martian curse, and that no mission has ever landed on Phobos
<|endoftext|> Saturn's moon Iapetus (the "Death Star") has also been the subject of some of this high octane speculationSo Revelation Space? (It's a good read, with this very concept) - In regards to Iapetus being hollow - the density is slightly higher than that of pure water ice. If it were hollow, it would need to be able to sustain the same mass/size ratio as though it were another iceball. Tethys is in this same density category, as are most small moons around Saturn, and its rings are all pretty much particles around that same density too. (hovering around 1 g/cm^3)So just remember folks - nature doesn't have an agenda the same way that human beings vying for power do. It can be tested and doesn't intentionally hide anything.Coming from a background in astronomy and working in geosciences department, researchers are just normal people who use software to build models. There's enough material online you can learn the science on your own and use the same Python libraries [used by professionals]( - And all public funded projects have public data after a set time. So go crunch the numbers! I think the most controversial work out there is in ETI detection from huge data sets. [This paper]( is an interesting approach that needs a lot further work.Could it be hollow? Sure, but if you're looking for a juicy conspiracy, there's more than enough happening with the Deep State right now.
<|endoftext|>Why are we trusting science fiction writers to put something in the "best" way about a real celestial body? In the 1970's, two Soviet scientists proposed an alternative theory: Earth's moon may be a hollowed out spaceship.How does that explain it's density?
<|endoftext|>I don't usually comment here, but I will in this instance. It is a spectacular coincidence that total solar eclipses can happen right when humans are alive. Millions of years from now, the Moon will be farther away from Earth. It gets about 4cm farther from Earth every year, so millions of years from now it'll be so far that it'll look smaller in the sky and won't be able to block all of the Sun's light. If you run this in reverse, that means the Moon was closer in the past. In the distant past it was in the same place as Earth, meaning it came from Earth. Giant impact is really the only logical explanation to these observationsEdit: letters
<|endoftext|>I follow suit with the ship hypothesis with a way out their notion. I think it is the key to reincarnation. Our consciousness is nothing more than the sun providing the energy to the moon. The farther(sun) provides the seed to the womb of the mother(moon), giving birth to the holy ghost(earth)
<|endoftext|>I think we went to the moon , but faked all the footage shown to the public. I just can't see our paranoid cold war government giving away anything that could have been a tactical advantage to the USA. You had this absolutely batshit crazy paranoia about communists and you want me to believe that we were just going give away information about out advanced space vehicles, lunar modules, first photos of the moon etc. to the "commies" . This sort of explains the Kubrick theory, and all the fake moon rocks.
<|endoftext|>This is a globe.
<|endoftext|>Tethys and Minas are also death stars. EDIT: Look at their heat signature, pacman eats ghosts, death stars are stars of death....
<|endoftext|>The moon has an equal chance of or being a flat somewhat translucent disc. There is documented stars being seen through the unlit portion of the moon. We also know it is much smaller due to the shadow size being approx 70miles in the upcoming eclipse.Interesting stuff, more interesting is that mainstreamed science won't touch this possibility. Likely to continue to cover up the moon landing hoax. 
<|endoftext|>there are lots of movies, songs and shows lately that speak about the end. it's well past 2012 so i don't think it has anything to do with that. i think something really is coming. kanye tried to tell people the truth recently and he got taken off to the hospital by handcuffs....bieber has been going to bible study and he cancelled his tour. idk. things just seem weird. i just heard harry styles song "sign of the times" and i can't get it out of my head. i know this is kind of off topic but predictive programming is 100% real and we need to talk more about it. 
<|endoftext|>well there's good 'evidence' of underground cavern systems on the moon but i like the idea it's a huge hollowed out space ship. Easy to test I guess with usa, china, russia, and everyone wanting to go there to exploit/ experiment/ prove concept. 
<|endoftext|>Whoever built the pyramids had a [clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.]( But what is astounding to me is that the earth and the moon are so perfectly balanced. Why did these ancient cultures [know the shape and size of these bodies thousands of years ago?]( And WHY do the Earth, Sun, Moon have these [mathematic relationships?]( is some more interesting info]( about our units of measurement and their relationships to the moon.Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always, and is the PERFECT distance and size from the earth to eclipse the sun, it seems like the moon is the most likely candidate for an artificial satellite. But it still blows my mind as to HOW and WHY??There are harmonious mathematical relationships between many of the other planets as well. [Here's the astounding relationship between Earth and Venus.]( [here's another video]( that shows the relationships between all the other planets in the solar system.
<|endoftext|>This is an interesting relationship that I hadn't seen before. It's interesting except for one small detail. Pi is approximated as 22/7, not 11/7. 22/7  3.1428...
<|endoftext|>Thank you very kindly for this information. Wonderful rabbit hole to delve into. And thanks for making sticky threads on topics that are considered as "fringe" as this one. Very refreshing to see on this sub (especially with all the politics garbage dominating the front page).
<|endoftext|>Glad to see someone mentioning Van Flandern. Also important to mention that he hypothesized that planets & moons are "born" out of a fission process: is the only theory I'm aware of that really makes sense with Velikovsky's conclusion that Venus was ejected from Jupiter (the red spot).
<|endoftext|>I find this CIA experiment with ~~Ingo Swann~~ don't remember who it was, but may have been, to be interesting and relevant:The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.  Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.Here is what it looks like on Google Earth (Mars):  mountain there is the famous "Face on Mars":  has an easter-egg chatbot there on the mountain (called MELIZA):  CIA docs on psychics:An Experiment into the Psychic Magnification Effect:  Experimental Psychic Probe of the Planet Jupiter:  in Human Paranormal Capabilities:  Assessment of the Evidence for Psychic Functioning:  dossier discussing Project GRILL FLAME.

<|endoftext|>Isn't it established that a planet *was* supposed to be there but Jupiter's gravity kinda prevented the accretion?Quick wikipedia:The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[7] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[7][8] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.
<|endoftext|>It could have been destroyed by a gamma ray burst or perhaps an extremely temporary occurrence of strange matter collision that caused the annihilation of Planet V. 
<|endoftext|>hmm.. couldnt find the equiptment failing part, but in the wiki said:The density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[57] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[57] In addition, images obtained by the Viking probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one. :(
<|endoftext|>The cardiac cadence/circadian rhythm and biological clock conform almost precisely to the Martian day.
<|endoftext|>It seems as though newer studies put it back closer to 24 hours:
<|endoftext|>unfortunately for that theory, the old days were shorter. length of the day is increasing over time. hence the leap seconds. my internal clock goes on 36hs, but neither my wife nor my boss want me to sleep 12hs longer each day ;-)
<|endoftext|>Or maybe humans are originally from another planet that has 25 hour day and has much better ecosystem for humans. Who knows maybe Atlantis or Garden of Eden are not places or cities on Earth in the past but actual Planets in our Galaxy or beyond...

<|endoftext|>My guess is that this wave anomaly is from a cloak that hides whats on the moon. Or maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirely, and only made to look like a rock in space.
<|endoftext|>Better video that shows 10 wave captures and discusses them from someone who shot the first one. Also tells how he was attacked by official sources. He has many videos talking about this and what it may mean.
<|endoftext|>Really? I read an in depth explanation on how this "wave" anomaly *was* caused by the camera. I'll have to dig for the post.edit: found the possible explanation. that's been debunked I thinks it's a very reasonable explanation.
<|endoftext|>I think it's a similar effect like asphalt on a hot day. The ground looks wavy and moving.The atmosphere has an amount of heat I'd assume(even at night) but since it's at such a large scale the waves aren't as extreme
<|endoftext|>what in the actual fuck ! its like someone turned V-sync off on the moon lol, on a serious note though, any scientific explanation / debunking to this ?
<|endoftext|>Hologram theory is interesting, but people need to remember it's not the government, it is some other intelligence or "creator" who is showing us that hologram, this is part of the theory that we are essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project. The other about moon waves is more simple, and biblical, which is that space is water, and we are lied to about it. As above, so below. God separated the waters from the waters. I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lot. Look at space, planets, stars in a telescope and you see it all looks like it's lights under water. Astronauts train in water, their suits are built to exist in water. The deepest sea dive ever recorded that they found water within water, a shore with waves underneath the ocean and they simply bounced off when trying to submerge in the secondary pool. 
<|endoftext|>Can't watch the video, but had this shower thought: could it be a Schlieren effect from a plane passing by?
<|endoftext|>Some think these make the moon look holographic, but I think the moon is hollow, and that vibration is like when you ring a bell and the surface vibrates. NASA states that when they landed on the moon it [rang like a bell!](
<|endoftext|>The moon is an astral body. And we are dreaming. Our Physical reality is built with a template that reflects our state of what we call dreaming. So in a sense everything is from that template and it's product though it seems solid, is actually the dream manifest.Especially light bodies in space. These bodies receive influx of energy to maintain their form. Just like we do. Only we don't analyze how our own energy field ripples. It does, just like the moon's energy field. It's template reality.
<|endoftext|>My god that is terrifying. I got actual chills watching that, and the feeling that I...shouldn't have been seeing it. Like something out of Lovecraft. Never even heard of this before either, thanks man
<|endoftext|>many people are now seeing the moon glitch and change shape as well as refresh like a computer projection
<|endoftext|>Where else have you seen a "hologram refresh" , what makes you believe that?Why do you believe that "camera artifacts" can be debunked, but not that it being a hologram be debunked, because that has been debunked a thousand times over
<|endoftext|> And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.I'm gonna go with the explanation that it's definitely either the camera or an artifact. That or maybe it's hot air in front of the camera.
<|endoftext|>I can't help but wonder if it's a property marker, much like these....
<|endoftext|>the far side of the moon would, in fact, be the face of the sun. I believe they would align perfectly.
<|endoftext|>The moon doesn't orbit in a perfect circle around the earth. Sometimes it's closer, some times it's further away. In fact, the difference between the closest and farthest points is about 30,000 miles.This does have an appreciable effect on how big the moon appears, and can even make it appear noticeably smaller than the sun. An [annular eclipse]( is when the moon eclipses the sun, but is close to the far point in its orbit. This makes the moon smaller than the sun in the sky, allowing a ring of sunlight to pass around the moon (this ring is called an annulus).
<|endoftext|>No, it would have to be much much more than 100 miles. 100 miles is nothing.Also the moon doesn't stay the same distance all around the earth, just as the earth isn't always the same distance from the sun. During a perfect solar eclipse, the moon doesn't quite cover the whole sun as we still see a kind of halo around the moon. If they were the exact same size in the sky we wouldn't get that.
<|endoftext|>now I know a lot of Christians don't believe in aliens due to not being explicitly written in the Bible, but my theory is that if God designed the Earth to be so full of all sorts of diverse lifeforms, why would he leave the rest of the Universe barren of other life? Surely he would populate them with all sorts of unique life as to reflect His glory. After all, human curiosity has taken us to journey out of the Earth. What good would this curiosity do if there was nothing to find out there?
<|endoftext|>ironically, nowadays that in itself is a crazy conspiracy theory to a lot of people :P, but one i agree with, although i do hope other planets with life exist and that god didn't decide to stop with us for some reason. 
<|endoftext|>i believe A god made it. or rather a very intelligent being and we are the product of a large science experiment and we aren't the only ones. and other planets in our solar system have undergone the same testing. mostly mars 
<|endoftext|>The moon is actually drifting away, what's "convenient" is that we get to see it at a time when it appears to be approximately the same size as the sun.
<|endoftext|>They're not that perfect. Only for those right in the path of the shadow.
<|endoftext|>perhaps they did fake the Moon landing in order to prove to the public that the Moon is uninhabited when in fact it is settled by other civilizations. William Tompkins stated in his book that when Apollo 11 landed in Tranquility, there were huge alien warships circled around the edge of the crater. later they used other films to show to the public broadcast instead. then with the alien's permission the apollo program sent several other missions before being barred from coming back again
<|endoftext|>Religious reasons, they think the earth being round is the number one thing in history that leads people away from god, and a flat earth would absolutely have to be designed
<|endoftext|>The purpose is to hide God. Read your bible,the sun wasn't made until the 4th day and it was made to give light to the earth. There is nothing in the bible that supports a spinning ball earth rotating around the sun. Please dont point to Isaiah 40:22 and tell me that proves a ball earth,it literally says circle. A circle isn't a ball. Satan rules the world right now (Luke 4:5-7) and we are in the age of deception. Pray for discernment and read your bible.
<|endoftext|>Iapetus is the Roman name for Japheth.Japheth was the eldest son of Noah, and his sons were the first to be taught by God how to bury their dead, and the supposed progenitor of the Caucasians.Japheth was a Roman way of saying someone has Greek blood (i.e. a bloodline from time immemorial).
<|endoftext|>[Bright Insight video]( People claim to have seen lights coming from the moon. Moon Express is launching a mining operation to the south pole of the moon. Moon rocks from the moon contain unnatural (artificial) isotopes. It goes on and on!
<|endoftext|>David Icke talks about this in his books and even mentions some of the work shown here. Starts around the 51:00 mark 
<|endoftext|>Holy shit. That was fucking amazing. I was expecting some sort of stupid Hollow Earth calibre idea here, but that... kinda makes sense...
<|endoftext|>It's cool seeing hypothesis that go against the mainstream. It's less cool seeing hypothesis that argument against an imaginary theory, because the author do not understand the mainstream theory.He claims "mathematicians" claim that heavier elements formed in DISTANT random supernovaes. The actual idea is that they formed on the supernova that originated our system, using the atoms of a single supernova to build the current sun and planets.Just like arguments of the fake moon landing. It could be fake, but arguments like "you should see the stars!" are not helping the case at all.
<|endoftext|>The moon has incredibly irregular gravity, which makes having this orbit it quite difficult. So the grand plans of towing asteroids into orbit of the moon are much harder than people think. The gravity is irregular because of discrepancies in the density of different parts of the moon. There is quite a wealth of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. 
<|endoftext|>I love that you swing both ways ;-)So, if you mentioned Pink Floyd, is it a coincidence they were friends with Douglas Adams, creator of HHGTG?Now, that was a book that made my thought juices flow!
<|endoftext|>Why not though? The universe is ginormous and strange and rare things happen all the time. The moon was once closer to the earth and its getting farther away each year, meaning one day it won't appear the same size as the sun in the sky. We are just fortunate enough to be alive at this time to witness this.
<|endoftext|>Shower thought.. Moon is artificial Moon doesn't perfectly eclipse When did it? Answer this and we know how old the moon is. Why was a perfect eclipse necessary? Someone needed a window against the Sun's direct energy? Then again, night would solve that... Literally just crazy thoughts about something I've never really thought about 
<|endoftext|>Why wouldn't you see blue sky? You don't see it through the moon so much as you see the bright part of the moon reflecting sunlight through the blue sky.Having said that, it is interesting that the moon and sun appear almost the same size in the sky. 
<|endoftext|> I was always curious as to why we could see the blue sky through the MoonYou don't see the blue sky through the Moon, you see the Moon through the blue sky.Imagine a crescent moon at night. The dark side of it appears black, much like the space surrounding it. Now imagine the same crescent moon during the day, the "dark" side appears blue, much like the space surrounding it.Also, if it were semi-transparent, then how do you explain Earthshine?
<|endoftext|>you can see the dark side of the moon during the day (or at night) with a telescope. its not transparent. the sky is blue and you see the bright moon through the sky not the blue sky through the moon.
<|endoftext|> It is too a coincidence we never see the 'dark side of the Moon'It's the inevitable result of Earths gravitation influence. If you nudged the moon and made it spin a bit faster, it would eventually go back to how it is now. 
<|endoftext|> The moon also has an atmosphere. Google it.Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.  The moon is an artificial satellite. There is overwhelming evidence for this. There is not.
<|endoftext|>jesus... I wish there was enough funding to send all of the moon deniers or people who think it is a hologram or has an atmosphere, up to the moon so they can check it out themselves.Commercial spaceflight cant come soon enough...
<|endoftext|>Thank you for this. A very interesting read, like most of your posts and the links you share. Thanks for being a light in the darkness!
<|endoftext|>All the planets in our solar system. I'm sure in the billions of galaxies there are more that have this rare feature. Maybe not.
<|endoftext|> Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun?Not that rare. 100% of the Earth's moons behave in this manner.
<|endoftext|>not just that it fits in there but that it fits in there while humans are on earth. a few million years ago and it was too close for a perfect fit in a few million years from now it will be too far away for a perfect fit. the fact that it is a perfect fit in the time when humans can use this to better observe the sun and space and it is all so damn perfect it is Ludacris. 
<|endoftext|>Okay, I read the link.. I get the basics in reference to the crates and whatnot, but what, exactly does this whole theory express? I don't want to buy the book.
<|endoftext|>lol what? just what? the moon doesn't cool objects in its light. what? the sun and the moon are not the same thing. you can see them both in the same sky at the same time. what kind of primitive thinking are you using here?
<|endoftext|>You do relatise that Pluto has a moon, Charon, that's quite similar in size to Pluto itself? I know it's been desclasified as a planet, but it's a celestial object with another just as large as itself in orbit around each other. 
<|endoftext|>You do relatise that Pluto has a moon, Charon, that's quite similar in size to Pluto itself? I know it's been desclasified as a planet, but it's a celestial object with another just as large as itself in orbit around each other. 
<|endoftext|>Suggest it for the next one! Better yet, compile some info and make your own post! I think a more general "anomalous ancient sites" topic would be a great future round table. For example, [here's some stuff I found out about Puma Punku]( an amazing site in Bolivia.tbh, the civilizations associated with these sites and the origin of the moon might be more related that you might think (we're supposed to be going high octane, right?).After all, Aristotle wrote of an ancient people called the "Proselenes" who lived in Arcadia and who were said, by the very nature of their name, to have lived "before there was a moon in the sky".Some writers (ie the authors of Who Built the Moon?) think future humanity literally went back in time to put the moon there. 
<|endoftext|>I see 38 votes for moon anomalies, 5 for phobos anomalies, and 10 for hollow earth which easily puts this topic at #1.
<|endoftext|>Lemme elaborate on this since ive read about in on the internet, when you die your spirit, not your soul, releases its grip on the body, causing a release of heat, this heat will carry your spirit to the moon where the moon will absorb and digest it, your spirit will cease to exist, BUT, if you managed to develop a soul from the seed that is your spirit in your lifetime you will be able to choose wether to stay in our solar system within the ifluence of the sun as a soul, to feed the moon consciously, or to travel straight into the sun and become one with our creator, that is what ive read, yes what a crock of shit
<|endoftext|>thats the craziest thing I've ever heard that gets thrown around a lot. Don't believe that nonsense, it's to instill fear.
<|endoftext|>The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory. If the moon was formed by material ejected from the earth in a collision, then that material would have come from the crust of the earth, not the earth's denser core. The collision formation theories are most accepted, but vary from what objects collided with the earth to form the moon. Seismometers placed on the moon in the 1970's, though, recorded the moon "ringing like a bell." By this time we'd landed on the darn thing and still weren't convinced the moon was solid. Of course, the argument can be made that a society sophisticated enough to craft a moon sized space station could sufficiently camouflage it to fool the primitives who live on the host planet.  
<|endoftext|>I have heard the moon being translucent and stars being seen through the unlit half of the moon but never witnessed this or ever seen pictures/video of it. I imagine with all the eyes in the world looking up at the moon that we would have some pictures out there of stars in the dark side of the moon but they just don't exist. I have a telescope and can see the unlit half of the moon during the day. its always there and it has never appeared to be see through any time I have ever looked at it. 
<|endoftext|>Whoever built the pyramids had a clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.That's not proof they understood the size of the Earth and Moon, just that they were able to produce a pyramid with a set of dimensions that squared the circle. The Earth and Moon do the same "coincidentally", but someone on Earth could figure out those proportions and admire their mathematical elegance *on their own* without ever looking up at the sky.
<|endoftext|>Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always,Both of those statements are wrong. There are plenty of perfectly spherical moons in the solar systems, name just about any moon of a jovian planet and its likely to be spherical. Also, Pluto and Charon are tidally locked (which is the term for when a moon orbits at the same speed of its rotation so one side is constantly facing the planet) to one another. I think there are a few other cases of tidal locking in the solar system as well. 
<|endoftext|>Yeah...a satellite. Arabs before being Muslims were venerating the Moon...see 3/4 of muslim countries flags and coat of arms featuring quarter moons.So you're saying there was a a satellite of the moon in the 7th century?
<|endoftext|>Funny how some people put effort into finding patterns between numbers everywhere, yet don't put any effort into remembering (or even checking) for arguably the most know value of all, Pi. Says a lot about what their true aim is.Maybe if one would invest more time into understanding and less time into explaining, the world would be a better place.
<|endoftext|>Whilst the eclipse conjoins his Ascendant/Mars conjunction, Saturn at 21.11 Sagittarius is exactly on his Moon at 21.12 Sagittarius. This eclipse, which so exactly replicates Trumps chart, and which casts a shadow over the whole of the USA was a clear, unequivocal indication that he would win the 2016 election, but I dont think any astrologer spotted it at the time. But now that the eclipse darkens his chart, and the USA, will this be good or bad?
<|endoftext|>It was Joe McMoneagle. Ingo Swann did write an amazing book (That you can find for free online as a pdf) called 'Penetration' In which he remote viewed the dark side of the moon. And what he found was amazing. He also talks about the strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water, ect.If you guys are interested in this stuff please check out my sub r/projectstargate I also have a video interview posted of McMoneagle talking about that "Trip" to mars.
<|endoftext|>The Mars/Jupiter papers are both great. Page 6 of the Jupiter paper discusses solar & planetary fission... something I hadn't heard of outside of Van Flandern. Thanks! 
<|endoftext|>Is that the prevailing theory in cosmology? Is it just the assumed natural evolution of the solar system? i.e. What would happen if nothing dramatic occured astronomically to affect the earth's motion? Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing? Anyhow, it doesn't explain the biological clock. 
<|endoftext|>Length is gradually increasing over time, okay, but that ignores my suggestion that an astronomical event dramatically decreased it at some time in the past.
<|endoftext|>that's flawed, the nuclear war he talks about apparently gouged out massive canyon's and is singlehandedly responsible for the fact mars is a desert wasteland now, hell it used to have oceans, to assume anyone beyond the very rare bunker or statue or temple, and i mean VERY rare, is absolutely absurd. Although i like the way you think. 
<|endoftext|>now this i can get behind. perhaps its a cloaking device that keeps amateur astronomers from seeing the cities and bases built there
<|endoftext|> maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirelyLike an alien observation station and its off limits for humans.
<|endoftext|>This is actually one of the better theories out there. Thank you for a very fresh alternative perspective.I do remember a certain researcher (God I forgot the name, I think he had some really long lectures on the Moon and Mars on Youtube) discuss how probes sent to the Moon hit a giant wall before coming to a halt. As if there were structures on the Moon. Built by aliens? Built by ancient humans? Current humans? Who knows, it is an interesting theory though.
<|endoftext|>interesting, it could also be waves caused by a change in temperature in the layer between moon and layers of atmosphere or there is a layer of water between us and the moon layer.
<|endoftext|>If the equipment causes it, why does the 'wave' go out of frame in one video where he pans, then it reappears in the frame from the bottom edge without having changed speed or angle, exactly where it would have been if he hadn't panned? EDIT: [video here]( don't see how this clip is compatible with that redditor's explanation. The wave phenomenon seems to be totally decoupled from any equipment effects.
<|endoftext|>That's not an explination. I've never heard about this stuff until today, but if you watch [this video]( about a third of the way through it he shows how the camera will pan and the wave will not pan with it, which clearly shows it's something external to the device. The only explination that makes any sense in light of that information is that it's atmospheric. 
<|endoftext|>Sure it is a good explanation but that doesn't mean that single comment discredits the entire thing, and what helps back my thought up is the comment below it blindly accepts it so quickly. 
<|endoftext|>sorry but that's not the same effect. your example shows the entire image effected. like when you take a pic when your phone vibrates. the moon wave is completely different bc the entire photo doesnt vibrate. there is clearly a wave anomaly that is happening on the moon. the wave on moves across the surface. it pulses and is not constant as your effect describes. space above it not effected. its a sweeping wave that moves consistently across the surface and wraps the curvature of the moon. 
<|endoftext|>Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.
<|endoftext|>Looks to me like it's only on the moon though..if it was an atmospheric phenomenon, you'd see that wave in the space around the moon too
<|endoftext|> and they simply bounced offThey bounced off because it wasn't water, it was brine and of a higher density and buoyancy than water.
<|endoftext|>It's the atmosphere, dude. Gas is fluidic, just observe the behavior of air above pavement on a hot day. That's why it all looks like lights under water *from an Earth-situated telescope* but not from any videos from in space (assuming you believe any of them are real).
<|endoftext|> essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project.You are referring to Gnosticism. Where God is real, and the universe was created, but not by God but a kind of "malevolent force" with the hopes of separating consciousness and hiding from consciousness it's beginning/true power. This is the ancient religion that the Matrix movies are based around. I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lotLiterally impossible as red/blue shifting wouldn't be a thing and at a certain distance away from us stars would just not be visible (like just about any source of light not in our solar system).
<|endoftext|>well space isn't a true vacuum anyways, it has material that floats around. though if applying the holofractal theory, space is considered a type of matter
<|endoftext|>I want to find that video of the water in watet. I remember seeing years ago. The water had a current and waves. It was so wierd. I don't recall the part where they bounced off it though. It was some time ago.
<|endoftext|>I think if this was proven to not be atmosphere (as it's definitely not equipment related) then it would serve as proof that we're living in a simulated reality.
<|endoftext|>Or an illusion caused by temperature change, shifting air masses, water vapor or any host of atmospheric event- especially if the waves move from the bottom upward? 
<|endoftext|>search youtube for moon wave, there are plenty of other examples. It's really weird, looks like a video that's refreshing
<|endoftext|>I think you're taking that a good ways out of context. Since they're talking about seismic activity it reads as if he's referring to long, continued vibrations and shaking. Something like a handbell or even the vibrations felt after striking a bell. That doesn't necessarily mean it's hollow, just that he was describing the very long time frames of the tremors. 
<|endoftext|>Argument for a locality. These kind of pics cast doubt on their actual distance... This is part of how I startd to wonder if things are different than our education teaches us.
<|endoftext|>This kind of stuff more or less cherrypicks in various ways, between which celestial bodies are being compared, the grounds for comparison, and the relationships being found. For every one "Woah" relationship found, a hundred duds were thrown out.If you examine everything for all conceivable relationships, the biggest coincidence would be finding no coincidences.
<|endoftext|>Evolution doesn't happen by chance. Evolution is the result of natural selection. For your comparison to be true, there would had to have been many different shaped and sized moons orbiting Earth, yet now only one remains due to its specific shape and size.
<|endoftext|>I think it's pretty likely. The variety of breeds humans have been able to produce just by selective breeding kind of shows how we can make animals change to have certain traits. Now just do that but for millions of years and eventually the DNA will be so far apart that breeds won't be able to produce viable offspring anymore. 
<|endoftext|>So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat. So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members? Clearly all of this is created either way. Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is. I mean the flat earth has to be at the most likely to not exist out of 100's. I doubt 10% on /conspiracy believe it's flat. There's just so much evidence from pictures of the Earth from space. I don't think any of it has to do with religion. The Roman Catholics did get very corrupt just after a few hundred years though so I wouldn't put it past them to lie to scare people into giving money.
<|endoftext|>I have the same attitude towards the flat earth theory as you do. If it were flat, I don't think it just be so NASA can rack in cash. I believe it would be hundreds of years before NASA was even born, that the deception would have started. But then we have People like Newton who would also have to be a lie.Too me, as a guy who's only watched like 20 mins about it, maybe the earth is simply bigger then what they tell us? Apparently NASA means to deceive in Hebrew. Huge if true.
<|endoftext|>I read the Bible 3 times a year cover to cover brother. I've only seen support for a round earth over and over and over in the Bible.
<|endoftext|>Even [the Wikipedia page]( for the equatorial ridge is pretty explicit:It is not clear how the ridge formed. One difficulty is to explain why it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are at least four current hypotheses, but none of them explains why the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio.It's easily one of the most incredible unexplained things we've discovered in our solar system.The ring "Chicken Little" theory [was suggested by]( *Discover* Magazine:The *Discover* article points out that the theory has not yet been "peer reviewed", but there it is. We're being asked to believe on the basis of a computer-claptrap model that the ridge "fell from the sky" after "rings" were formed around the planet, rings which were unstable, and which fell into the surface of the planet.Uh huh. What about those three parallel grooves? Were there three neatly parallel ring unstable ring systems?There's actually *another* theory that "Iapetus may have possessed its own moon that became tidally shredded to create a ring system that eventually fell to the moon's surface."OK...a moon with a moon which became tidally shredded to form a neat ring, which was unstable, which then fell to Iapetus' surface and formed that neat equatorial ridge. And, presumably, became shredded in such a way to form three closely bunched parallel rings in three planes which were all unstable and then fell to the planetary surface?Would Iapetus have had sufficient force to be able to shred its own moon? Can we see what the possible mass of that moon may have been? Would it have been enough to create the equatorial ridge?"But whatever the source, it seems scientists are agreeing that Iapetus couldn't have created the mountain range without some help from up above."I don't know about you, but that strikes me as yet another tongue in cheek remark. "Help from above?" Help implies helpers. Helpers implies intelligence. Intelligence implies......on yea, we can't go there. The ridge has been "explained." Perfectly natural. Nothing to see here...move along, it fell from the sky after a moon was tidally shredded to form an unstable ring system which collapsed and fell on poor Iapetus....
<|endoftext|>You are right, he definitely has a chip on his shoulder. He is brilliant, however. He is responsible for smuggling Pentium computer chip tech to the Soviets early nineties...
<|endoftext|>I think this one is from the Stellar Metamorphosis theory. Basically, the universe is a lot older than 13.8 billion years... possibly eternal. And all planets are formed from the eroded leftovers of stars.According this this theory, the sun would be the youngest object in our solar system. Jupiter would be a fair bit older. Earth would be a lot older and Mercury is absolutely ancient.
<|endoftext|>That other physicist that people post here theorized that everything is a black hole and all we see are the event horizons 
<|endoftext|>Orbiting the moon is certainly impractical. For parking asteroids for mining purposes, the earth-moon lagrange points L4 and L5 would make a lot more sense, though I'm not sure how viable"landing" something the size of substantial asteroid into those points would be; on-site extraction might just be more practical than moving the entire asteroids.
<|endoftext|>Why don't planets stop spinning then, as they are like moons to the sun?Do other planets moons not rotate?Edit: Found this cool article:  which provides info towards my second question. Interesting stuff
<|endoftext|>Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.What is you PhD in? Where do you base this on? When accredited scientists have proven otherwise. There is not.Edited:Prove to me that the moon is a natural satellite. I can, and will debunk this. History books on the moon are, and have been re written. New evidence trumps old theories.
<|endoftext|>What about the 3 Apallo spacecraft that were fuelled, and ready to bring men back to the moon, that were left to rust. We have the money to go back. We already spent some. But TPTB refuse to. Why is that? You said "If only there was funding." Like our fiat monetary system couldnt establish that. We dont go back to the moon for a very exact reason.
<|endoftext|>I can elaborate on this. The moon's distance and size relative to the earth is almost too coincidental to be naturally occurring. There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. There are records in some extremely ancient cultures of certain peoples being around 'before the moon'. There is no theory for the formation of the moon that makes sense, the impact theory is something championed by most people but they don't read the next paragraph of that theory which states that an almost equal impact would have been necessary directly after to correct course and spin. The is a very compelling case that the moon isn't naturally occurring. If you're interested read a book called 'Who built the moon' by Christopher Knight. Very interesting, although their conclusions leave something to be desired. The theory that it was flown here has risen from a combination of these different anomalies. It would make sense to place a large body like the moon around a planet a species was interested in interacting with, sort of like hiding in plain sight. The notion that the moon isnt naturally occurring gives credence to this. Of course it's just a theory, there is no conclusive proof it is a type of space ship. But then again, if there was conclusive proof this topic wouldn't be in the conspiracy subreddit ;). 
<|endoftext|>Well at least you understood my small effort to inject a little humour. The original meaning of "lunatic" actually meant being under the spell of the Moon or "Luna" which is it's ancient name, like the ancient one for the Sun which is "Sol" from which we get solar, solstice, etc.The French word for the moon still is "la Lune" and there were of course people in ancient times who worshipped the Moon and "Diana" who was the goddess of the Moon and was believed to live on the Moon and they used to dance and frolic under the light of the full Moon in their outdoor ceremonies dedicated to her. And then there's the whole business about moonlight being romantic and people falling in love in the moonlight.And the Moon is very strange and mysterious and we really don't know very much about it and a whole lot of people really are utterly fascinated by the whole business... almost to the point of being under a spell by it.But there can't be any of those "lunatics", here, now can there? Or maybe I should have said "moon-atics"? 
<|endoftext|>The astronomers no longer consider Pluto to be a planet for a number of valid reasons and it's difficult to say what either Pluto and Charon actually are at this point. If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the two and they both actually orbit around a point in space *between them* that actually traces their path around the Sun. It's unusual because that point between them is closer to Pluto giving Charon an outer orbit around that point and Pluto taking an inner orbit around it on the opposite side of it as if they were rigidly connected through that point in their motions. So it isn't any typical planet/moon arrangement but two bodies orbiting an invisible point as if they were both moons going around it. Their tumbling orbit around the Sun as they wheel around it together is also highly unusual and brings them even closer to the Sun than Neptune is throughout parts of it probably because they weren't created by or with our system but rather captured and pulled into that off-kilter orbit after being cast-off from another system beyond ours.
<|endoftext|> The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory.How? If it were hollow, how could it have a density of 3.34 g/cm^3 ? If the moon was formed by material ejected from the earth in a collision, then that material would have come from the crust of the earth, not the earth's denser core. The collision formation theories are most accepted, but vary from what objects collided with the earth to form the moon.Okay? Seismometers placed on the moon in the 1970's, though, recorded the moon "ringing like a bell."By this time we'd landed on the darn thing and still weren't convinced the moon was solid.The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moisture. Not because the moon is hollow. Of course, the argument can be made that a society sophisticated enough to craft a moon sized space station could sufficiently camouflage it to fool the primitives who live on the host planet.Certainly, but that could be said about literally anything around us.
<|endoftext|>Yeah. I've heard the distance increases the rate of recession, so it's 4cm/year now, but a million years from now it could be 1km/year (just making up numbers to explain)But yes right now the sun and moon share the same apparent diameter. In the distant future that won't be the case anymore, making total solar eclipses impossible.

<|endoftext|> Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?Yes, [we've measured it decreasing]( 
<|endoftext|>Not really _my_ theory, just a thought I love to entertain, simply for the beauty of it (the continent coasts don't only fit where the Atlantic is, but also where the pacific is). "[Expanding Earth]( gives nice search results on YouTube, and it seems to overlap here and there with "Electric Universe"/"Plasma Universe" approaches to cosmology. Interesting trivia: it _precedes_ Wegeners plate tectonics theory by almost a century :)
<|endoftext|>I've found the moon rabbit hole is deep and one of the most disturbing, because dealing with the implications of all the strangeness, coincidences, and anomalies having to do with the moon is so far-reaching it can shake the foundations of everything you think you know.Crrow777, the man who captured the first video of the lunar wave, has a good Youtube [channel]( if you want to dive in. You can search for "moon" in his videos, but he delves into a lot more. This guy will have you questioning everything.
<|endoftext|>You are thinking of Phobos, a moon of Mars.The Soviets sent 22 probes, none sent back useful info - one is even rumoured to have filmed a rocket leave the surface and impact the Soviet's probe.
<|endoftext|>There's a great video of (amateur?) rocket equipped with outer camera going from surface of the earth to zero gravity. It's almost as if it hits the water. Google it.
<|endoftext|> also explained. He rotated the camera with respect to the 'field' and corrected the image with editing software or a field rotation prism in the telescopeYou are probably right on and in one of his videos he says he done exactly as you say, rotating the camera then turning the image back right with editing software.
<|endoftext|>He's saying that since the camera is on earth (and in Florida in this particular video), the heat in earth's atmosphere may cause a visible ripple. 
<|endoftext|>no the moon but OUR atmosphere here on Earth. we are looking through it to the moon which distorts its image slightly. thats my take on it. Not that the moon is hot
<|endoftext|>That's assuming the wave covers the entire length of the cameras POV, which translates to thousands of miles. Stars twinkle all the time precisely because of these atmospheric waves, but they don't twinkle in unison because these shifting densities are smaller in scale than that.
<|endoftext|>No, we wouldnt expect to see it on the dark area around the moon -- there is no light from there reaching our eyes. 
<|endoftext|>Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.
<|endoftext|>It's so hard to find the real video with the researchers talking about it, it was intentionally deleted I believe by the BBC and they were able to have youtube delete basically all the uploads. That's one of those things where you have to wonder what is so damaging about that account from a scientist that they went to that much effort to erase it entirely. Much like antarctica, there is much hidden about the deep ocean for unknown reasons, very little is allowed to be released to the public. 
<|endoftext|>perhaps, but what intrigues me is why the wave seems to follow the curvature of the moon rather than just traveling over 
<|endoftext|>It doesn't do that through a telescope. I've tried many times. I don't know if it's the atmosphere or the video camera but it isn't the moon. I know that for sure. It's real and round 100%. I know this is /conspiracy but I have a lot of friends with big telescopes. 
<|endoftext|>Sweet! I do that too! I just need a better camera to mount on my lens. Right now it's decent but maybe half the quality as these vids. It's really cool to have a telescope with GPS hooked up to a camera recording on your laptop. 
<|endoftext|>way to take what they said out of context. seismic activity needs shifting plates. considering NASA previous statements about the moon, I think "rang like a bell" has a literal connotation. 
<|endoftext|>Hmm, let me try to be as clear as possible. The body you are in now is actually a physical projection from a different state, ..though it's not so much a state as it is a different area of our consciousness. The only difference between your waking and dreaming self is that while waking we separate from that area of dreaming. And in doing so project a dream reality apart from it. The key to understanding our planets and moons and space in general is that it is a reflection of our focus. As we are projecting into this dream we agree on a focus. A template. A model. And this 'entering into' as a focus here, during that entering the focus adopts the model and projects it as a reality. So when most think of planets having an effect on us, or that they were the results of God's or scientific Theories... that is the complete opposite of what is actually happening. The human consciousness is reflecting itself as a layered reality. Dense physical waking self in one area, and then light astral body dreaming self, or space, as another layer of consciousness.
<|endoftext|>Yes, this is pretty similar to theists saying that the low odds of our planet being in the goldilocks zone is proof of a designer. 
<|endoftext|>Perhaps even evolution isn't happening by chance. It could be that all of reality, including all of nature is communicating with itself on a quantum level in closed systems - thus creating grounds for an intelligent evolution, with intelligent mutations, not entirely random ones. One where "Intelligent design" isn't done by a Deity, but by nature itself.This is supported by the /r/holofractal theory of the Universe (not yet validated by mainstream science and probably missing some parts and connections to make it so, but I do feel it is a step in the right direction).
<|endoftext|>I do understand evolution. Be honest, the odds of life evolving on this planet or anywhere else in the universe are just as improbable as the uniqueness of our planet's moon. Improbable but not impossible. You should learn to appreciate that. 
<|endoftext|>So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat. So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members? Clearly all of this is created either way. Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.That isn't my understanding. My impression from speaking with flat-earthers is that the bible says the earth is circular, but not "round" in the way you mean it. They all believe that the bible strongly implies that the earth is flat and round (circular). They believe that the push towards thinking the earth is a globe and could have formed naturally is specifically to make people believe that a god isn't required for the earth to exist, while a flat earth could not form naturally and is proof of gods design.Not that there aren't flat-earthers who aren't religious, but that's really been the only motive I've heard for this supposedly huge cover-up

Mainstream physics: the edge of the universe is similar to an event horizon, and the schwarzschild radius of something with the mass of the estimated mass of the universe would be about the radius of the observable universemy madness: we are inside a black hole, collapsing. The reason we see an expanding universe is simply that we perceive time as the direction where entropy increases. It's arbitrary whether we are collapsing or expanding.
<|endoftext|> What is you PhD in? Where do you base this on? You don't need a PhD to check the phase diagram for water. When accredited scientists have proven otherwise.Cite your sources, this would be the news of the century in every scientific journal, I've yet to see it.  Prove to me that the moon is an artificial satellite. I can, and will debunk this. So you're arguing against yourself now? 
<|endoftext|>I love moon mythology. I remember reading this YouTube transcription of Stichens Sumerian tablets, and how the Anunnaki were always enamoured by our moon. Perhaps they were amazed because they knew it was fake but they themselves didn't build it? Whoa dude. Aliens upon aliens! That said, let's be scientific. If the moon IS FAKE, how can we test and prove it? Is it falsifiable? If we trace time back, can we figure out when the move actually arrived? I posted a thought earlier to wondering when our lunar eclipse used to PERFECTLY eclipse the sun? Is there something interesting about that date? If it was designed to perfectly eclipse, why? What technological advantage would that present? Perhaps it needs constant reorbiting to keep it in the perfect eclipse range but after its creators/operators left, it has been spiralling outwards ever since? HOLY fucking shit...  last paragraph seems to indicate that TREX would have seen a full eclipse..... 50 million years from now we won't have total eclipses anymore.. Therefore it happened around 50 or 60 say million years ago.. Did the moon kill the dinosaurs? Yeah, lock me up I've officially gone insane lol
<|endoftext|> If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the twoYou are mistaken. they both actually orbit around a point in space between themThat's because Charon is such a large moon, that it's fucking with Plutos position. 
<|endoftext|> The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moistureYou seem pretty certain of that, would you mind explaining where you get that from? Because the moon ringing is established fact. The composition would be based on a handful of moon rocks brought back. One seems far more reliable than the other. Don't take this as a personal attack but it sounds like you aren't willing to entertain the idea the moon is hollow despite compelling evidence that it is. Edit: You did post where you got that from, my mistake for not reading further down. However I read your pdf article. When we theorize the moon is hollow I think you misinterpret what we mean by hollow. It still has something it it's core, the mass in between the surface and the core is evidenced to be either hollow or honeycombed. There is still a core if course because there is still a magnetic field. In fact none of the sources you posted provide a reliable theory for the composition of the moon. That's because there isn't one. The conclusion of the article assumes the impact formation theory, which is in no way reliable or certain. In fact you might be interested to know that the only way the impact theory for the formation of the moon can be correct is if there was a second almost identical impact afterwards. Science based on assumptions is just that. Again, don't take this as a personal attack, it's not. But throwing shade around like; but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollowWhen your conclusions are based on assumed theories you can't be certain of them. The attitude you are taking is kind of the opposite of the scientific process which you seem to champion so strongly.
<|endoftext|>Dude, I am not a physicist. I got that from Wikipedia. After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center. But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density. Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth. Doesn't make it hollow. Makes it less dense. I'm not arguing the moon is hollow. I'm just sharing information about the theory.
<|endoftext|> original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetA) how the hell would you know the original height to such a specific degree andB) I find no source saying it was that height, it just seems to be convenient to your next equation rather than a representation that's accurate. According to wikipedia it was 480.6 ft. 
<|endoftext|>Did they use miles and feet at this time? I like your theory but i wonder if this would still work in the measuring units of their time.
<|endoftext|>The dimensions of the Giza pyramid correspond to dimensions of our planet and the moon at a scale of 1 to 432,000. The sun has a radius of 432,000 miles.How does the pyramid correspond to the the Earth and the Moon at the same scale? It doesn't.original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetBest idea for the original height is 480.6 feet or 280 Egyptian cubits480.6 * 432,000 = 207619200 = 39321.8181818 miles 3,938.685 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 11 miles, or an error of about 0.2%)39321.8181818 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 35372 miles or an error of about 90%) you'll probably have to add some crap about ratios or factors in there.You might as well use the real numbers. Also love the how the pyramid is accurate to 4 decimal places but you're happy to use 432,000 instead of 432287.938 which is the Suns actual radius in miles and good to let slide errors in measuring the polar radius. Could that be because none of your magic maths would work otherwise?
<|endoftext|>Fun fact / Maybe we're going too far : the A note used to be 432 hertz before we set it up to 440 relatively recently
<|endoftext|>Yeah man, I was just enjoying some kooky dooky arguements about the Cloud People, and wherever the fuck the moon came from. Now its ruined by some asshole shoving his randomly quoted text down my throat like it's a 'balloon' that Bill Clinton expects on his birthday. I can bring him up because hes a mind controlled puppet of the Illuminati hell bent on keeping their position of slave masters on this prison we call 'Earth'
<|endoftext|>I have a pretty damn good telescope, and I can tell you for a fact there is not 'greenery' on the moon.
<|endoftext|>Those are indeed strange facts. Since most think the moon is a dead/natural satellite.But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. But you see them crop through the news now and again as they are "rediscovered"
<|endoftext|>I love the idea of flipping everything we know around, because all I feel they need is hidden tech, and they can tell all the lies they want. I know it's not healthy to always think the world is against you, but it helps when you remember it's all of us regular (if you don't want me grouped with you that's cool) people against the ambiguous "them".But I take breaks here and there and enjoy time with friends to solidify myself here and not lose grip.Strange times ahead for sure. 
<|endoftext|>Phobos is little more than very large rock. It's about the length of Manhattan. Gravity is near enough to nil that anything living on it would be better off just living in zero-g. 
<|endoftext|>There are many good leads but this is probably not one of them. Look up how they "de-spin" rockets which normally spin in order to maintain some orientation. Absolute linear speed changes are not going to be easy detect with no reference frame.
<|endoftext|>I'm unconvinced.How does field rotation correlate with a phenomenon that appears to track across the visible moon both before and after the field of view pans?If you feel field rotation is enough then perhaps you can break down how it caused the specific observed effect even after the pan, addressing each of these points:1. The telescope captures a "wave" apparently between the moon and the telescope lens propagating at a constant speed and direction.2. The telescope is panned such that the "wave" is out of the visible frame.3. The "wave" catches up with the visible frame, re-entering from the bottom edge where we would expect it to be if the camera had not panned, and then continues at the same constant speed and direction until reaching the top edge of the moon.
<|endoftext|>I thought a chap in Germany had independently verified his observation?This is a relatively new phenomenon. I'm open-minded about waiting for more evidence. I'm not saying it's real, but to say outright that it's a fraud is a conclusion without evidence too.
<|endoftext|> Not that the moon is hotthe temperature on the surface of the moon hit by the sun can reach over 250F
<|endoftext|>Believe in things that can produce results. I 'believe' in many aspects of science because they produce direct, observable results. As for the moon being a hologram? Makes no sense, how could we predict tides if the moon didn't have mass. Moon bases and moon settlements/cities? I doubt it just like everything else. Extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence, etc. but I don't dismiss it, because I have no way to know one way or the other. 
<|endoftext|>consider things as probability/possibility. belief is a tough one. you can have faith in a thing. apply the sceintific method to a thing. things are harsh. learn as much as you can. it always pays off. 
<|endoftext|>This is hardly meant to be a conclusive argument, but the reason the waves appear chaotic above asphalt is the proximity of high heat makes a lot of displacement waves in the air, which collide into the chaos we're used to seeing. At higher altitudes, few waves would be generated and are less likely to collide, so it's possible to see it keep a consistent angle and velocity.Source: B.S. in physics and a lot of recent experience with wave/sound mechanics
<|endoftext|>Yea, and I can't find decent information on it. I want to study the virtual reality aspect of reality or at least things like the moon.I don't know anything about Antarctica other than they seem to be pretty secretive over that place.I can't figure out what the reasoning would be by tricking people it's round if it's flat though. Even if it is flat, what does that really change or matter? 
<|endoftext|>Nonsense. BBC licensing agreements with YouTube doesnt mean shit. You can still read the papers these scientists wrote. Why not just send them an email?
<|endoftext|>Tbh I think its most likely an artifact of digital recording. It would constantly be refreshing the contrast between the white and the black- i.e, the edge. Does anyone have footage of this shot with a non-digital film camera? Have these things been seen with the human eye or is it just something that happens if you zoom a digital camera at the moon long enough ?
<|endoftext|>It *doesn't* follow the curvature. It's more pronounced on the vertical side of the moon and by the time it gets to the top horizontal line it's imperceptible , and *doesn't* come back down the other side. That's exactly what I'd expect if a ripple was moving from down to up in the atmosphere between the observer and the moon.
<|endoftext|>So who or what are other people? If their real, why doesn't their dream focus affect my dream too? 
<|endoftext|>How is that? Firstly, the odds aren't really that low, and secondly, that would mean that even if it is low, it's still probable without a creator. 
<|endoftext|>If a higher dimension entity isn't a designer that how is this being created, by our own minds? Lol I wonder if Mario and Luigi are atheists. 
<|endoftext|>Eh that's different though since life should only likely observe itself to be in a place that is suitable for life to be. So like, while our planet is certainly extremely rare it should be extremely common that any life that exists exists in the rare suitable places for it.The eclipse lining up at the same time humans start recording history has no obvious necessity.
<|endoftext|>The usual argument for this is like the anthropic principle. The planets where it didn't happen there is no one to complain about it, the odds of us being on a planet where we evolved are 100%. The moon isn't like that. Some aspects of it might be, such as stablizing the axis of rotation and the climate stablity that comes with that. The convenient eclipse size is just fun though. It's proportionally much larger than moons around other planets. And it's not a uniform density either, attempts to orbit probes very closet to the surface failed due to anomalies in the gravitational field much larger than anywhere on earth. I don't know about the "moon wave" thing, this is the first time I saw that.
<|endoftext|>as a christian, that sounds absolutely ridiculous. you might as well say the Earth is actually a square as "proof" of intelligent design
<|endoftext|>I don't mean a perfect circle. I need to check that thread on how many people do believe the Earth is flat.We can go to the "edge" if that's the case ourselves. No one is guarding the entire edgle. It's just 1000's of years this conspiracy has gone on with no one messing up. We go into space and take pictures of the moon, and from satellites. I hope we all know even if we didn't go to the moon we were in space near it. I think they walked on the moon.
<|endoftext|>No, the Bible supports a round Earth that isn't at the center of the Universe. I can get the scripture. I just went through a lesson on this.
<|endoftext|>I wanted to look into this more as I e never heard of it and I found this.  seems those rocks are still really cool, but not all that mysterious. 
<|endoftext|>it has been, mainstream science has blacklisted alien/religious theorist's and tons of these theorists have said this, any evidence they find is usually laughed off, and often only published on websites like this or personal websites, and if you ask most informed people, which I've done, and probably shouldn't have because it's done wonders for my reputation i'm sure, they'll tell you how obvious it is that most mainstream scientists won't even humor alternative science, only doing so when it gets popular. 
<|endoftext|>The Moon is a pretty deep rabbit hole :). And it leds you down the path of realising that we know almost nothing about cosmology, and that most of our theories on it are at odds with new data almost on a monthly basis. Personally I'm convinced the Moon isn't real in the sense it is an organicly occurring satellite, I believe it was very much put there, by whom I can't be sure. A shower thought I had the other day was that if there is a malignant alien presence exerting an influence over our species, and IF there is a galactic council or something similar trying to do something about it, it would make sense that the Moon being the craft the malignant aliens came here on would give them some sort of insurance against the tampering of their affairs but other species. "Hey you, stop messing with the humans and leave their world!", "Sure bro, we'll just take the Moon with us", "But that would be catastrophic!" "Then I guess stay out of our business."Not saying that's what I believe, just a thought I had ;).
<|endoftext|> You seem pretty certain of that, would you mind explaining where you get that from? Because the moon ringing is established fact. The composition would be based on a handful of moon rocks brought back. One seems far more reliable than the other. Don't take this as a personal attack but it sounds like you aren't willing to entertain the idea the moon is hollow despite compelling evidence that it is.The moon ringing is actually proof that it isn't hollow:
<|endoftext|>It's possible that all planets are hollow.Check out the book Hollow Planets by Jan Lamprecht, it's pretty stunning actually.
<|endoftext|> After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center.Here is a more scientific analysis of what the moon is made of (pdf warning):  But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density. Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth.There is a good quora article about it, but keep in mind that primary sources are far better, but less accessible: Doesn't make it hollow. Makes it less dense. I'm not arguing the moon is hollow. I'm just sharing information about the theory.Fair enough, but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollow.
<|endoftext|>the distance of 1 KM is still the same amount of distance if measured in Miles, but the numbers are different because each unit of measurement is in comparison to a control. Every measurement is just measuring the variance from the original control object. 
<|endoftext|>But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. Any sources? Proven facts are documented.
<|endoftext|>Millions of astronomers over thousands of years and the first dude to observe this is a flat earther?Gimme a break. Obvious fraud.
<|endoftext|>Crow's videos were shared with the fine people studying atmospheric optics over at /r/atoptics and opinion was that the video was fraud or possibly a contrail. No one else observes this phenomenon.
<|endoftext|>if it were an artifact of digital recording the wave would likely move or change in state if the camera panned. If you look at the video [here]( he shows footage of the wave not moving with the camera as he pans quickly, and follows it's original trajectory as if unaffected by the camera itself.
<|endoftext|>Why do you insist on misquoting me? LOL. Conspiratards will tell any lie to support their delusions. 
<|endoftext|>I need to get a USB camera. Mine hooks up to my laptop and I can get it on my screen. I'll definitely record hours of footage. I looked for aliens for years and all I've ever seen is satellites. On my space forum 1000's of people who are experts (with telescopes, ones 30 feet tall some have built) all say they have never seen anything weird about the moon, any planet, or seen any UFO's. 
<|endoftext|>apparently people have only captured 11 waves so far on footage. and some occur near equinoxes or during lunar eclipses
<|endoftext|>It does. We all ripple out. Everything we do or believe , our thoughts, mental energy travels invisibly all around us, and we are in a sense biological antennae receiving it, and projecting it. Collectively we agree on what objects and forms will hold all the energy constantly overflowing from each person in this reality. The Sun is powered by us ,by our energy. The moon itself is a symbol of night, of dreams. we all agree on what we dream together, and the forms this will take.
<|endoftext|>Other people are their own consciousness. You or I are individual. You talking to me is your creation. Me talking to you is my creation. We each create our reality, but we cooperate. Just like we are doing. Only we also cooperate in ways we take for granted. Like we agree to agree there is a sun over our head and a moon trailing behind it. It's automatic, the stuff we take for granted is an automatic agreement. 
<|endoftext|>I don't think it's a valid argument, I was making the comparison to say that I don't think astronomical coincidences (size and position of Earth, of the moon and so on) are very meaningful. It's like a lottery in which each ticket has an equal and vanishingly small chance of winning but there must be a winner. Given that we have a moon it has to be one distance from the earth or another. Seeing its current position as somehow too "perfect" to be accidental is a very human-centric position. 
<|endoftext|>A common thought is that Antarctica is actually a seawall all around the flat earth that is a circle shape. This would explain the reason why all countries have forbidden Antarctic exploration on a mass scale. Then a dome, "the firmament", encloses our atmosphere. The firmament is in Genesis. 
<|endoftext|>Kinda hexagonal shaped. And there are other shapes that look like they could have been buildings. But this sounds like a very harsh environment, to harsh for life to exist. The spaceship theory was fun too, but I think we know enough about the make up of Ipateus to know that's not very likely either. But Im open for discussion, whats your theory if you think these were built? Why? or what purpose do they serve? 
<|endoftext|>I second this. I watched a presentation of his a few years back, thinking that it'd just be some more hollow earth ridiculousness. I did not expect to be convinced, but it was solid, well reasoned, and not full of the esoteric imaginative gibberish that most hollow earth stuff has.
<|endoftext|>"but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollow."Thought we were discussing "theories" here?  In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory. Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief. I know what the moon is made of. I can Google scientific papers all day long. That's not what I want to do. I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories. But no. You come in here all Logical and link all your "peer reviewed" research from accredited publications. Great. Thanks. You've ruined this for me. 
<|endoftext|>They used cubits and other things I can't remember the names of... furlongs? Idk, but the thing is, the units weren't standardized; like a master mason might have his set of measuring sticks passed down from his father who he apprenticed under, and maybe even his grandfather etc, but his would be slightly different than another masons tools although they would both measure a cubit. It wouldn't really matter, as long as they stick with one per structure so it has standardized units of measurement throughout; it would be a pain in the ass to renovate a building you didn't originally build though... Anyways, my point is that it would be damn near impossible to align structures to true north or whatever down to the last micrometer like people insinuate when they talk about these things when everyone is essentially using a unique measurement unit, I'd assume that they're pretty damn close but not perfect.
<|endoftext|>So you think there are green (read about chlorophyll) plants on the *dark side* of the moon? You understand why that wouldn't make sense, right?
<|endoftext|> Sure. I will only use new sources found from Google. But if you read his book, you will find many more sources from years ago.  Atmosphere:   Proof of atmosphere, means proof of Wind.  Greenery: I can't find anything on Google. Please read the book for that one.  Water:   There are many more strange, yet provable occurrences on the moon as well.
<|endoftext|>Sure. I will only use new sources found from Google.

<|endoftext|>No, because there arent ten other people.Thousands of years of Astronomy and one dude observes this phenomenon and no one else? Lol
<|endoftext|>It doesn't matter what he believes. The video evidence stands on its own, until it is properly debunked. His personal views don't change the footage, and trying to discredit that evidence just because you disagree with him on other things is pretty closed minded.
<|endoftext|>Ah interesting, I thought you meant fraud as in the moon is a fraud. He claims some of the videos are from other people but who knows if that's true

<|endoftext|>Sad, wonder why there used to be so much activity and now almost nothing. There are some theories saying they camouflage themselves somehow, need IR camera and stuff like that.But I suppose who knows at this point, you could make a bunch of theories up from that, maybe they're grouping up somewhere, preparing?Wishful thinking I know, besides we have those who believe they are demons. 
<|endoftext|>I fully understand what the terminology means. The Matrix is way over populated. It is also not mega advanced tech wise. Some people who have a NDE can clearly see the "White Light" at death is completely staged and somewhat synthetic and even crappy. People all over the world have been experiencing "Glitches In The Matrix". From identical people, cars, locations and objects completely respawning, to the projection actually freezing and the characters and objects around them staying in place for numerous seconds.
<|endoftext|>It's a bit tautological too. If it wasn't "perfect" (e.g. close enough to evolve life that can get intelligent), we wouldn't be here to realize it. 
<|endoftext|>But how is it too perfect? Why would it being seemingly the same size as the sun in our sky bare any real significance? What does the fact that solar eclipses happen sometimes actually change in our lives, other than a few moments to go "oooo". The moon could be a different size or distance and tides would still happen, which is a much more significant phenomena to aid the growth and spread of life than eclipses. 
<|endoftext|>if i thought it was nonsense, i wouldn't have said it, and if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want but mainstream everything, from politics to science is constantly caught cheating, lying, stealing, and blackmailing as well as blacklisting things they don't like, only people who don't like the truth blindly believe they don't exclude narratives they don't like. 
<|endoftext|>yeah, i researched hollow theory quite a bit and did a presentation on it for my chemistry class for a pseudoscience assignment. it actually stirred my curiosity on to look into other "conspiracies." my conclusion is that until we have the technology to dig past our crust, we'd have to rely on assumptions given through how the seismic data is interpreated 
<|endoftext|> Thought we were discussing "theories" here? In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory. Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief.There is no evidence that supports the moon being hollow, that is my point. I know what the moon is made of. I can Google scientific papers all day long. That's not what I want to do. I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories.Again, that's fine, just don't pretend they are legitimate. Thanks. You've ruined this for me.Good, people need to spread actual knowledge rather than nonsense, otherwise we'll keep coming closer to a modern version of the Dark Ages ...
<|endoftext|>[Holy moly. It's not literally dark, dude. It's tidally locked & we only ever see one side. The moon has days and nights, just like us.]( #5
<|endoftext|>Uh I'm reading the book and so far all I can find is that he's citing other books, namely Jessup, Morris K. (1957). The Expanding Case for the UFO. New York: Citadel PressandStrange World of the Moon - 1962 (by VA Firsoff)Neither of these are in print.Swann refers to Firsoff as a top scientist and authority on the moon. This seems to a be a pretty strong embellishment based on what can be found about the man.MK Jessup is a better known ufologist who was at one point a PhD candidate but it's not clear that he ever finished his degree or worked in science in any capacity after that point.I'd say this is a pretty weak source overall.
<|endoftext|>Try thinking. Maybe the wave wasn't there thousands of years ago. Maybe they didn't have high def cameras.Try checking before making a blatantly false statement. This video shows 10 wave captures by people around the world. 
<|endoftext|>Do you really think that after thousands of years of observations only Crow77 has ever observed this phenomenon?Do you simply believe every video you see, even when that video contradicts the personal observation of BILLIONS of humans over thousands of years?Dude, think. Obviously fraud. 
<|endoftext|>I'm highly confident the "aliens" are fallen angels/demons. I've had a lot of contact with them since age 14 when it started. I brought a demon back from Peru and it will tell me it's name if I ask. It possessed me and I started stabbing myself with the Peruvian knife (turns out it's the Peruvian God of war carved on the knife and they pray over it).
<|endoftext|>its a bit far-reaching for me, but there are footage of planes stopping in the middle of air for a brief second before continuing. or planes simply vanishing like someone turned off a hologram
<|endoftext|>It's not tautological at all... cogito (or in this case, typito) ergo sum.I'm here, and no matter your belief in a fancy-shmancy CIA holo-projected universe, I really did type this, and this planet *is* a Goldilocks planet.And the chance that non-pernicious info is folded into every single species' DNA quadrillions of times, with a way to circumvent RNA's non-conforming-therefore-discarded policy is a number so large that it would require every molecule in the universe to count it out on a cosmic abacus.
<|endoftext|>Maybe it was created by people for people to wonder at, to block out the sun and show a display of power. IDK why you would involve religion/creationism at all unless that was your own neurosis.
<|endoftext|>Well their argument, which I think is fallacious, is that if quite a few of the conditions on earth weren't *exactly* as they are, we wouldn't be here. That may be true but all it means is that something else would be here. There's obviously no basis to believe someone or something arranged it this way to suit us. The argument seems to be assuming that there is something essential about human life and a universe without us would be a pointless mistake. 
<|endoftext|> if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want  I didn't call you any of those things, but if you insist let's go ahead and put this to the test.  Show me one of these papers published on a website that was rejected from peer reviewed journals, which has empirical evidence of the Moon's atmosphere supporting liquid water and greenery. All it would take is a few spectroscopic measurements, anyone with access to a telescope and some basic equipment can carry that out and publish their data, so where is it? 
<|endoftext|>During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around. It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed. New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed. If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view. 
<|endoftext|>Huh. Fair point. Now can you suggest any reason why only the side we can't see would have vegetation?
<|endoftext|>Why do you need a camera? Because you cant fake waves on the actual moon, but you can on video.All these "waves" are all in the same video released by the same person, lol You are being duped by someone that pushes pseudoscience to get subscriptions. 
<|endoftext|>LOL I am still laughing about this. Where are the source videos, Crow? I cant believe you took that video seriously.
<|endoftext|>I'm not saying you're wrong. You could be right.Where is it implied or suggested that this phenomenon is "thousands of years old?" For all we know this was first observed in the last few years because that's when it started. What evidence do you have for a fraud, other than an absence of evidence for it being a real phenomenon? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.I'm not suggesting anything, just pointing out what we can all see on the video. If you can explain how to achieve these effects within the constraints and also explain how a third party independently observed them from a different location, with separate evidence for it, then we can call it debunked and carry on with our lives. 
<|endoftext|>I'm still open to entertain that idea, but there's also the possibility of that kind of thing being a "distraction" or "misinfo". I just honestly don't know what to give more credence to. The beings could be friendly and trying to help, but "they" don't want that, so they're demons or malevolent aliens. But on the flip side, they could be evil aliens or demons sure, and the people shouting the benevolent aliens idea could be trying to get us to trust these beings who mean harm. I'm just anxious about the future and hoping this is all coming to a culmination, but I know there have been others like me waiting for an "event" as well and they've died with nothing occurring. Let's hope there's something to this "Great" Eclipse and the 23rd that follows.EDIT: I also mean to try more psychedelics hopefully in the nearby future, I want to see what my consciousness has to say about all the information I have cooped up in there. 
<|endoftext|>But what I'm saying is why would anyone who would create the moon need to make it so eclipses are present. It has no real baring on how life came to be. 
<|endoftext|>Not to further an argument that I also find fallacious, but it isn't just conditions on earth. All of the constants in the universe (Speed of light, etc.) are so perfectly tuned that if they were changed by on millionth of a percent matter itself could not exist. It's pretty mind blowing.
<|endoftext|>oh, i don't believe the moon is hollow, or supports greenery, i'm insane, not delusional, yet, and it's fairly well admitted i believe that the moon has ice on it, you can literally just type in 'moon has ice?' i'm too lazy too bother, and drunk, but the liquid water thing is probably bull, although looking it up on google search brings up lots of times mentions of water vapor, so there might be a little. don't see what difference it makes. 
<|endoftext|> During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.Yup, and people today are still stoned to death, and there were death camps in the 1990s ... we're not so far from history. It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed. New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed. If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view.A completely discounted, illogical and nonsensical point of view. It's this kind of 'science sliding' that leads to the coal lobby and other anti-scientific scam artists to hold so much power, they take advantage of people who just want to "discuss a different point of view" and allow it to grow into a powerful minority which ultimately profits only a select few ...
<|endoftext|>Well, that's probably pretty unlikely. It has been shown that our moon has a trace atmosphere, iirc from impacts and outgassing, but it's pretty close to a vacuum. There is ice on the moon, and a trace of water vapor, and the moon is capable of holding a breathable atmosphere for (I think) thousands or tens of thousands of years.  And there are Apollo images that look like liquid water, and are kind of tough to explain away, but I would bet they are something else like impact glass or some other substance.  The moon is a trippy place.**But do I think the other side has air and vegetation? No.**  I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night side. Space is so freaky and counter-intuitive that I don't judge ignorance or superstition or conspiracy theories. 
<|endoftext|>Ok you have no idea what you're talking about. It's been captured over a dozen times, from multiple states and countries. But you stay ignorant in your brain cage of rigid skepticism so closed off you cant even learn anything new.
<|endoftext|>Blocking out the sun is a pretty badass thing to do? There's different degrees of significance between Complete Coincidence and Created by God. Maybe the Face on the Moon is actually there and it was to show an ancient civilisations perceived mastery over nature.
<|endoftext|>There are so many "coincidences" that it almost feels natural, you know what I mean. The fibonacci sequence and Pi happening so often in nature is mindblowing. 
<|endoftext|>Liquid water and greenery was the specific claim that I was refuting at the top of this comment thread. You were seemingly defending that point when you responded to my request for a citation.
<|endoftext|>Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there. 
<|endoftext|> I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night sideYes, this was a pretty stupid assumption on my part. I can easily model it in my mind and see why it isn't the case. I just always took the name at face value I guess. It was an interesting lesson in my own ignorance.Edit: For instance, solar eclipses exist. I can be astoundingly stupid sometimes =)
<|endoftext|>yeah, i'm slowly getting more drunk, and honestly i don't really care about this anymore, i had to go over this statement like 3 times for errors, so have a good night, don't go to bed angry 
<|endoftext|> Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I think both prey on the same types of mindset. I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there.Certainly a stretch, but I do believe there is a significant 'trickle-down' effect when it comes to believing things for which there is no evidence.
<|endoftext|>Well no because it only effects me from my perspective lol. If i had a giant thumb and blocked out the sun for this hemisphere it would be seen as badass by some people. Especially if they worshipped the sun.
<|endoftext|>If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.Liiiiike, alternative fuels that might replace coal and other polluting fossil fuels. 
<|endoftext|> If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.I'm not saying that we should only accept what is known and proven, I'm saying that once a theory has reached a point that there is zero evidence to support it and there are mountains of evidence against it, then it should be treated as such.
<|endoftext|>Yes, exactly, putting my thumb out to cover the sun does only effect my perspective. Are you using that as a metaphor or something?
<|endoftext|>Everything is just relative to where you are. Just like you and your thumb, that's sometimes the moon and the planet. 
<|endoftext|>There's a lot more interesting things about the moon's dimensions as well, much of which was known by ancient monument builders who made the pyramids at Giza as well as Stonehenge and many other sites.For example, the ratio of the Earth's diameter to the Moon's diameter is 11:3, or 7920:2160 miles. This ratio produces a phenomenon known to ancient geometers as squaring the circle. If you made a circle with a radius of the Earth's radius, plus the moon's radius, then that circle would have the same perimeter as a square drawn around the Earth: if the Moon were touching the Earth, then you could draw a circle with it's center at the center of the Earth, and it's edge passing through the center of the Moon, and that circle would have the same length around it's edge as a square perfectly enclosing the Earth. This relationship is illustrated in the great pyramid at Giza in the ratio of its height to its square base, and in the concentric rings at Stonehenge.This relationship would not be there if either the Earth or the Moon were a little bit bigger or smaller, and is even more amazing when you realize the significance of measuring these dimensions in miles. The ancient approximation of pi~~11/7~~ 22/7 is reflected in the radius of this large circle encompassing the Earth and the Moon with radius 5040 miles, or 7! (7x6x5x4x3x2x1) and the diameter of the Earth (or one side of the square) with length 7920 miles, or 11!/7! (11x10x9x8). So whoever came up with the measurement of the mile clearly had this relationship in mind.There's even more significance when you start to look deeper into the cosmic patterns of the universe, but the moon is just the start. Our ancient ancestors who designed not only the length of the mile, but also the foot, meter and cubit had these cosmic dimensions and ratios as their basis, as explained so well by Alan Greene, who recently did an AMA. True, the moon is amazing, but once you start to study the deeper patterns in the cosmos and the sacred geometry all around us in nature, it becomes clear that the moon is simply one of many amazing "coincidences" of proportion that seem too perfect not to be designed. My personal feeling is that the underlying structure of our universe itself is beautiful, fractal harmonic relationships, and as a result, everything in the manifest world reflects that.
<|endoftext|>I put this thread together for /r/conspiracy a few years back:[A Little List of Coincidence in the Solar System]( Space, Geometry and the Golden Section. Do the planets hide a secret Harmony of the Spheres?
<|endoftext|>Astronomer [Tom Van Flandern]( and others have argued that there used to be a large planet between Jupiter and Mars (where the asteroid belt is today). Mainstream science doesn't entertain this possibility because there isn't a natural mechanism for the literal "explosion" of an entire planet.Van Flandern, undeterred, traced back the paths of scores of comets in our solar system, and discovered that many converged at the same time, and at the same location, at two points in the history of our solar system, with the most recent being approximately 2 million years ago. Other writers like Joseph P. Farrell (in his book *The Cosmic War*) offer a *technological* explanation for this major event, namely that this large, potentially earth-like object was *deliberately* destroyed, and even more hypothetically by a weaponized moon in our solar system.Van Flandern took it even further by speculating that "the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded "Planet V"."In support of this theory, some ancient cultures have lore that tells of ancient humans originating on Mars.If this interests anybody, I highly recommend reading *Dark Matter, Missing Planets & New Comets* by the late Van Flandern. He has an entirely new approach to gravity that honestly is quite stunning in its simplicity and implications.
<|endoftext|>The Hollow Phobos Hypothesis has significant evidence to back it up, which is a problem because, paraphrasing Carl Sagan, there isn't an accepted *natural* explanation for a hollow planetoid.[The Phobos Monolith]( is also the subject of significant speculation.There has also been a curious history of failing equipment each time we get close to this enigmatic moon...
<|endoftext|>One thing I often wondered about was the difference between the Earth's 24hr day and our biological 25hr clock (put people in a room containing no natural light nor clocks, and they will naturally have 25hr sleep/wake cycles.) What if some time ago the earth had a 25hr day, and some astronomical event slowed it down. That would explain why our clock is off. But when did it happen, and was the moon involved?
<|endoftext|>The one that I find most interesting is John Brandenburg and the evidence for prehistoric global nuclear warfare on Mars. [Death on Mars by John Brandenburg]( White interviews Brandenburg on the skeptiko podcast]( [The first sentence on the Brandenburg page at rationalwiki:]( John E. Brandenburg is a plasma physicist who went somewhat off the rails in 2012 and started proclaiming that he saw clear evidence of a thermonuclear war on Mars in the distant past.
<|endoftext|>Let's try to factor in those [moon "wave" anomalies]( in here also. Because to me, it looks like a hologram that's refreshing or something. And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.
<|endoftext|>The Moon has 99% been a part of (or in the vicinity of) Earth since it's formation. The decay of the Helium isotopes matches up which means that the Helium atoms on Earth and the Helium atoms on the Moon have been close to each other since just about their formation. Another way of putting it is that both sets of Helium have experienced the same amount of time in the universe, which can only mean that they have travelled together. This is all pretty concrete and is the reason why the impact hypothesis is the currently accepted theory.UNLESS, the moon landings never happened and the "Moon Helium" is in fact terrestrial.

<|endoftext|>Is it possible that because of the sheer size of everything, that there is a "zone" in which the moon could reside to give us the same eclipse effect? I've heard astronomers describe it like if the moon were 100 miles nearer or further it wouldn't give the same effect.
<|endoftext|>Here's a conspiracy that will be hated. Maybe there is a god/creator of the universe. And this planet is perfectly designed to support life?
<|endoftext|>The moon is 400 times smaller than the sun while being 400 closer to the earth than the sun, giving us perfect solar eclipses. That's pretty convenient.
<|endoftext|>Here is something relevant I posted a couple weeks ago. **NASA VIDEO EVIDENCE of the astronauts faking shots of "Earth at a distance" during the Apollo missions, while they were still very much in low Earth orbit.**Because once you realize that we may have never passed LEO, questions about the moon become much more valid. Another angle of thought is that we went to the moon, found out something that was too much to tell the public, so we filmed and faked an alternate moon reality (NASA's moon footage) and have been presenting that to the public ever since.______The following evidence represents an extremely important moment caught on camera that I believe has never been adequately addressed by NASA or any NASA supporter. In my opinion it is equivalent to what the WTC7 collapsing footage is to the 9/11 truth movement.It comes from the documentary A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon but I am not trying to convince anyone of anything from an obviously biased documentary. Be skeptical of all of it. I encourage that. When this clip plays in the documentary there is a narrator but, again, I am telling you to completely ignore that voiceover if it pleases you.Simply use your eyes and use your brain and look at what I am about to show you. I am purposely separating the most important footage from the documentary and its bias, muting the narrator, and breaking the clip up into very short digestible gifs. Lets start.Does this look like the Earth to you? Would you assume that this is a shot from the far reaches of space, looking back at Earth from a distance? convincing right? Lets look at more footage of Earth at a distance: in the camera which we can only assume is pushed up against a shuttle window, pointed out at the Earth in the blackness of space: this shot is even better. Notice that you cannot really make out any continents? Notice that you see no stars? But for the sake of argument, lets just completely ignore that for now. Take a look: mean, thats definitely the Earth right? And you would have to be far beyond Earth (on the way to the moon) to get footage like that, correct? Again, no recognizable continents, No stars. But again, for the sake of argument, lets allow science to explain that.But wait, how exactly does this happen?  isnt the camera pressed against the window and zoomed in? Because they are far from Earth right, at least this far, correct? If they zoomed that camera back out. wait a minute, wtf is that? Is that the sun? on. Wut? Here is a longer gif just to make the strangeness very clear. that a work light? Of enormous size and floating in space?Wait a minute, whats going on?  to have your mind completely shattered? Look: wait, what? Yeah, that Earth at a distance was a clever camera trick. They used the circular shuttle window and the small part of the enormous Earth showing through that small circular window. Camera tricks and the illusion of a little Earth ball at a distance.As you can see here, they are very close to Earth. Like Low Earth Orbit close. And yes, that was a work light. You can now see it clearly. And that blackness was a darkened shuttle interior. Again: Or I dont know. I am willing to entertain any ideas or thoughts on this.And let me set the record straight once and for all:Do you personally subscribe to any Flat Earth or alternate Earth models? NODo you believe in the ISS and Mars rover missions? YESDo you believe that you can shine a laser at a retroreflector on the moon? YES, because the unmanned soviet [Lunokhod]( program left retroreflectors there.What about the other evidence: moon rocks, etc? I am not sure honestly, I do not feel like I have studied enough to make a decision.So what are you trying to prove then? I am simply pointing out that there is unusual footage of what appears to be the astronauts filming a disingenuous Earth. I find the footage fascinating and would love to know more about it. I would love to see the unedited footage and I would love to see the extended footage.How do we know this is real NASA footage? Because NASA included it in their Apollo 11 DVD set. Why, I dont know. But people definitely thought that pointing that out would somehow make my brain stop comprehending what it saw.As a matter of fact, [here is a website that appears to be trying to debunk that footage]( scroll to the bottom.This is their explanation:_____What Mr. Sibrel supplies is footage of the astronauts practicing for an upcoming telecast. **Because television was added at the last minute, they hadn't had time to practice much with the equipment. So they were experimenting with different camera positions and exposure settings**. Someone on the ground recorded it. Mr. Sibrel notes several observations which he can't explain in terms of his expectations, therefore he concludes the astronauts "must" have been faking it. That's it. That's his "smoking gun."_____And finally, here is [the TIMESTAMPED section of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon]( if this post piqued your interest. Once again, take everything said by the narrator with a grain of salt. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything other than what their eyes see and the conclusions their brain reach while watching that particular footage that I made gifs from. I personally have a hard time wrapping my brain around what form of context could possibly explain it. 
<|endoftext|>The other day I was reading through this thread and someone linked to a story about NASA sending 2 secret Apollo missions to the moon who made contact and were murdered by an alien life form.But now I can't find it. Anyone help me out with a link?

I have a wacky thought that maybe the souls of Humans (who do not ascend) pass through the hollow Moon, and those who do ascend pass through the Hollow Earth. Hence why they call people "lunatics" and why people act freaky during a full moon in the night (ie. the freaks come out at night).
<|endoftext|>Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun?

<|endoftext|>The moon fits perfectly into the sun. How could that be? Very simple, the thinking about the moon needs to change, stop assuming it is a giant rock, planet, or whatever. Think of it as 'the back of the sun' or a projection created by the sun. They are, in fact, the same entity, but that doesn't mean the moon doesn't have unique properties, such as the ability to cool objects exposed to moonlight. It is not a "place" you can visit, but the sun itself reflected, somehow.
<|endoftext|>Probably should have called this thread "Strictly for Professional Lunatics" lolWe know other planets have moons, both in our own solar system as well as in other systems in our galaxy but absolutely none of them have a moon that is anywhere as big as ours is in comparison to the size of the Earth itself. So that presents a curious anomaly as well as raising an interesting question about how the Earth could have initially attracted and held on to such a large moon when we have no other planets with moons that come anywhere close to being as big as they themselves are as we do and probably shouldn't have been able to do in light of that. That of course leads to the question about what the Moon itself and it's interior is made of and all the conjecture surrounding whether it may actually be hollow or not. Another interesting consideration is whether or nor what we have called and believed to be "craters" produced by meteors, may have actually been the result of some kind of violent and gaseous volcanic activity in the moon's distant past which would look pretty much the same when you look at and think about it from that perspective. You might want to cook and pay attention to a pot of oatmeal to get yourself into the mood for that. lol

<|endoftext|> Saturn's moon Iapetus (the "Death Star") has also been the subject of some of this high octane speculationSo Revelation Space? (It's a good read, with this very concept) - In regards to Iapetus being hollow - the density is slightly higher than that of pure water ice. If it were hollow, it would need to be able to sustain the same mass/size ratio as though it were another iceball. Tethys is in this same density category, as are most small moons around Saturn, and its rings are all pretty much particles around that same density too. (hovering around 1 g/cm^3)So just remember folks - nature doesn't have an agenda the same way that human beings vying for power do. It can be tested and doesn't intentionally hide anything.Coming from a background in astronomy and working in geosciences department, researchers are just normal people who use software to build models. There's enough material online you can learn the science on your own and use the same Python libraries [used by professionals]( - And all public funded projects have public data after a set time. So go crunch the numbers! I think the most controversial work out there is in ETI detection from huge data sets. [This paper]( is an interesting approach that needs a lot further work.Could it be hollow? Sure, but if you're looking for a juicy conspiracy, there's more than enough happening with the Deep State right now.
<|endoftext|>Why are we trusting science fiction writers to put something in the "best" way about a real celestial body? In the 1970's, two Soviet scientists proposed an alternative theory: Earth's moon may be a hollowed out spaceship.How does that explain it's density?
<|endoftext|>I don't usually comment here, but I will in this instance. It is a spectacular coincidence that total solar eclipses can happen right when humans are alive. Millions of years from now, the Moon will be farther away from Earth. It gets about 4cm farther from Earth every year, so millions of years from now it'll be so far that it'll look smaller in the sky and won't be able to block all of the Sun's light. If you run this in reverse, that means the Moon was closer in the past. In the distant past it was in the same place as Earth, meaning it came from Earth. Giant impact is really the only logical explanation to these observationsEdit: letters

<|endoftext|>I think we went to the moon , but faked all the footage shown to the public. I just can't see our paranoid cold war government giving away anything that could have been a tactical advantage to the USA.

<|endoftext|>This is an interesting relationship that I hadn't seen before. It's interesting except for one small detail. Pi is approximated as 22/7, not 11/7. 22/7  3.1428...
<|endoftext|>Thank you very kindly for this information. Wonderful rabbit hole to delve into. And thanks for making sticky threads on topics that are considered as "fringe" as this one. Very refreshing to see on this sub (especially with all the politics garbage dominating the front page).
<|endoftext|>Glad to see someone mentioning Van Flandern. Also important to mention that he hypothesized that planets & moons are "born" out of a fission process: is the only theory I'm aware of that really makes sense with Velikovsky's conclusion that Venus was ejected from Jupiter (the red spot).
<|endoftext|>I find this CIA experiment with ~~Ingo Swann~~ don't remember who it was, but may have been, to be interesting and relevant:The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.  Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.Here is what it looks like on Google Earth (Mars):  mountain there is the famous "Face on Mars":  has an easter-egg chatbot there on the mountain (called MELIZA):  CIA docs on psychics:An Experiment into the Psychic Magnification Effect:  Experimental Psychic Probe of the Planet Jupiter:  in Human Paranormal Capabilities:  Assessment of the Evidence for Psychic Functioning:  dossier discussing Project GRILL FLAME. Which is described as "a planned three year joint program which is in its first year between DIA and Army to investigate in detail certain paranormal phenomenon, such as, remote viewing and psychokinesis that have potential military applications.":  Edit: Correction.
<|endoftext|>Isn't it established that a planet *was* supposed to be there but Jupiter's gravity kinda prevented the accretion?Quick wikipedia:The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[7] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[7][8] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.
<|endoftext|>It could have been destroyed by a gamma ray burst or perhaps an extremely temporary occurrence of strange matter collision that caused the annihilation of Planet V. 
<|endoftext|>hmm.. couldnt find the equiptment failing part, but in the wiki said:The density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[57] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[57] In addition, images obtained by the Viking probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one. :(
<|endoftext|>The cardiac cadence/circadian rhythm and biological clock conform almost precisely to the Martian day.
<|endoftext|>It seems as though newer studies put it back closer to 24 hours:
<|endoftext|>unfortunately for that theory, the old days were shorter. length of the day is increasing over time. hence the leap seconds. my internal clock goes on 36hs, but neither my wife nor my boss want me to sleep 12hs longer each day ;-)
<|endoftext|>Or maybe humans are originally from another planet that has 25 hour day and has much better ecosystem for humans. Who knows maybe Atlantis or Garden of Eden are not places or cities on Earth in the past but actual Planets in our Galaxy or beyond...
<|endoftext|>if there is a civ that able to make nuclear, of course they would able to make bunker as well, and to debunk those prehistoric nuclear warfare on mars, someone simply need to find those bunker in the future or mars exploration
<|endoftext|>My guess is that this wave anomaly is from a cloak that hides whats on the moon. Or maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirely, and only made to look like a rock in space.
<|endoftext|>Better video that shows 10 wave captures and discusses them from someone who shot the first one. Also tells how he was attacked by official sources. He has many videos talking about this and what it may mean.
<|endoftext|>Really? I read an in depth explanation on how this "wave" anomaly *was* caused by the camera. I'll have to dig for the post.edit: found the possible explanation. that's been debunked I thinks it's a very reasonable explanation.
<|endoftext|>I think it's a similar effect like asphalt on a hot day. The ground looks wavy and moving.The atmosphere has an amount of heat I'd assume(even at night) but since it's at such a large scale the waves aren't as extreme
<|endoftext|>what in the actual fuck ! its like someone turned V-sync off on the moon lol, on a serious note though, any scientific explanation / debunking to this ?
<|endoftext|>Hologram theory is interesting, but people need to remember it's not the government, it is some other intelligence or "creator" who is showing us that hologram, this is part of the theory that we are essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project. The other about moon waves is more simple, and biblical, which is that space is water, and we are lied to about it. As above, so below. God separated the waters from the waters. I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lot. Look at space, planets, stars in a telescope and you see it all looks like it's lights under water. Astronauts train in water, their suits are built to exist in water. The deepest sea dive ever recorded that they found water within water, a shore with waves underneath the ocean and they simply bounced off when trying to submerge in the secondary pool. 
<|endoftext|>Can't watch the video, but had this shower thought: could it be a Schlieren effect from a plane passing by?
<|endoftext|>Some think these make the moon look holographic, but I think the moon is hollow, and that vibration is like when you ring a bell and the surface vibrates. NASA states that when they landed on the moon it [rang like a bell!](
<|endoftext|>The moon is an astral body. And we are dreaming. Our Physical reality is built with a template that reflects our state of what we call dreaming. So in a sense everything is from that template and it's product though it seems solid, is actually the dream manifest.Especially light bodies in space. These bodies receive influx of energy to maintain their form. Just like we do. Only we don't analyze how our own energy field ripples. It does, just like the moon's energy field. It's template reality.
<|endoftext|>My god that is terrifying. I got actual chills watching that, and the feeling that I...shouldn't have been seeing it. Like something out of Lovecraft. Never even heard of this before either, thanks man
<|endoftext|>many people are now seeing the moon glitch and change shape as well as refresh like a computer projection
<|endoftext|>Where else have you seen a "hologram refresh" , what makes you believe that?Why do you believe that "camera artifacts" can be debunked, but not that it being a hologram be debunked, because that has been debunked a thousand times over
<|endoftext|> And no, it's not the camera or an artifact, that's been debunked multiple times.I'm gonna go with the explanation that it's definitely either the camera or an artifact. That or maybe it's hot air in front of the camera.
<|endoftext|>I can't help but wonder if it's a property marker, much like these....
<|endoftext|>the far side of the moon would, in fact, be the face of the sun. I believe they would align perfectly.
<|endoftext|>The moon doesn't orbit in a perfect circle around the earth. Sometimes it's closer, some times it's further away. In fact, the difference between the closest and farthest points is about 30,000 miles.This does have an appreciable effect on how big the moon appears, and can even make it appear noticeably smaller than the sun. An [annular eclipse]( is when the moon eclipses the sun, but is close to the far point in its orbit. This makes the moon smaller than the sun in the sky, allowing a ring of sunlight to pass around the moon (this ring is called an annulus).
<|endoftext|>No, it would have to be much much more than 100 miles. 100 miles is nothing.Also the moon doesn't stay the same distance all around the earth, just as the earth isn't always the same distance from the sun. During a perfect solar eclipse, the moon doesn't quite cover the whole sun as we still see a kind of halo around the moon. If they were the exact same size in the sky we wouldn't get that.
<|endoftext|>now I know a lot of Christians don't believe in aliens due to not being explicitly written in the Bible, but my theory is that if God designed the Earth to be so full of all sorts of diverse lifeforms, why would he leave the rest of the Universe barren of other life? Surely he would populate them with all sorts of unique life as to reflect His glory. After all, human curiosity has taken us to journey out of the Earth. What good would this curiosity do if there was nothing to find out there?
<|endoftext|>ironically, nowadays that in itself is a crazy conspiracy theory to a lot of people :P, but one i agree with, although i do hope other planets with life exist and that god didn't decide to stop with us for some reason. 
<|endoftext|>i believe A god made it. or rather a very intelligent being and we are the product of a large science experiment and we aren't the only ones. and other planets in our solar system have undergone the same testing. mostly mars 
<|endoftext|>The moon is actually drifting away, what's "convenient" is that we get to see it at a time when it appears to be approximately the same size as the sun.
<|endoftext|>They're not that perfect. Only for those right in the path of the shadow.
<|endoftext|>perhaps they did fake the Moon landing in order to prove to the public that the Moon is uninhabited when in fact it is settled by other civilizations. William Tompkins stated in his book that when Apollo 11 landed in Tranquility, there were huge alien warships circled around the edge of the crater. later they used other films to show to the public broadcast instead. then with the alien's permission the apollo program sent several other missions before being barred from coming back again
<|endoftext|>Religious reasons, they think the earth being round is the number one thing in history that leads people away from god, and a flat earth would absolutely have to be designed
<|endoftext|>The purpose is to hide God. Read your bible,the sun wasn't made until the 4th day and it was made to give light to the earth. There is nothing in the bible that supports a spinning ball earth rotating around the sun. Please dont point to Isaiah 40:22 and tell me that proves a ball earth,it literally says circle. A circle isn't a ball. Satan rules the world right now (Luke 4:5-7) and we are in the age of deception. Pray for discernment and read your bible.
<|endoftext|>Iapetus is the Roman name for Japheth.Japheth was the eldest son of Noah, and his sons were the first to be taught by God how to bury their dead, and the supposed progenitor of the Caucasians.Japheth was a Roman way of saying someone has Greek blood (i.e. a bloodline from time immemorial).
<|endoftext|>[Bright Insight video]( People claim to have seen lights coming from the moon. Moon Express is launching a mining operation to the south pole of the moon. Moon rocks from the moon contain unnatural (artificial) isotopes. It goes on and on!
<|endoftext|>David Icke talks about this in his books and even mentions some of the work shown here. Starts around the 51:00 mark 
<|endoftext|>Holy shit. That was fucking amazing. I was expecting some sort of stupid Hollow Earth calibre idea here, but that... kinda makes sense...
<|endoftext|>It's cool seeing hypothesis that go against the mainstream. It's less cool seeing hypothesis that argument against an imaginary theory, because the author do not understand the mainstream theory.He claims "mathematicians" claim that heavier elements formed in DISTANT random supernovaes. The actual idea is that they formed on the supernova that originated our system, using the atoms of a single supernova to build the current sun and planets.Just like arguments of the fake moon landing. It could be fake, but arguments like "you should see the stars!" are not helping the case at all.
<|endoftext|>The moon has incredibly irregular gravity, which makes having this orbit it quite difficult. So the grand plans of towing asteroids into orbit of the moon are much harder than people think. The gravity is irregular because of discrepancies in the density of different parts of the moon. There is quite a wealth of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. 
<|endoftext|>I love that you swing both ways ;-)So, if you mentioned Pink Floyd, is it a coincidence they were friends with Douglas Adams, creator of HHGTG?Now, that was a book that made my thought juices flow!
<|endoftext|>Why not though? The universe is ginormous and strange and rare things happen all the time. The moon was once closer to the earth and its getting farther away each year, meaning one day it won't appear the same size as the sun in the sky. We are just fortunate enough to be alive at this time to witness this.
<|endoftext|>Shower thought.. Moon is artificial Moon doesn't perfectly eclipse When did it? Answer this and we know how old the moon is. Why was a perfect eclipse necessary? Someone needed a window against the Sun's direct energy? Then again, night would solve that... Literally just crazy thoughts about something I've never really thought about 
<|endoftext|>Why wouldn't you see blue sky? You don't see it through the moon so much as you see the bright part of the moon reflecting sunlight through the blue sky.Having said that, it is interesting that the moon and sun appear almost the same size in the sky. 
<|endoftext|> I was always curious as to why we could see the blue sky through the MoonYou don't see the blue sky through the Moon, you see the Moon through the blue sky.Imagine a crescent moon at night. The dark side of it appears black, much like the space surrounding it. Now imagine the same crescent moon during the day, the "dark" side appears blue, much like the space surrounding it.Also, if it were semi-transparent, then how do you explain Earthshine?
<|endoftext|>you can see the dark side of the moon during the day (or at night) with a telescope. its not transparent. the sky is blue and you see the bright moon through the sky not the blue sky through the moon.
<|endoftext|> It is too a coincidence we never see the 'dark side of the Moon'It's the inevitable result of Earths gravitation influence. If you nudged the moon and made it spin a bit faster, it would eventually go back to how it is now. 
<|endoftext|> The moon also has an atmosphere. Google it.Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.  The moon is an artificial satellite. There is overwhelming evidence for this. There is not.
<|endoftext|>jesus... I wish there was enough funding to send all of the moon deniers or people who think it is a hologram or has an atmosphere, up to the moon so they can check it out themselves.Commercial spaceflight cant come soon enough...
<|endoftext|>Thank you for this. A very interesting read, like most of your posts and the links you share. Thanks for being a light in the darkness!
<|endoftext|>All the planets in our solar system. I'm sure in the billions of galaxies there are more that have this rare feature. Maybe not.
<|endoftext|> Can someone smart tell me how rare it actually is that our moon fits in the sun?Not that rare. 100% of the Earth's moons behave in this manner.
<|endoftext|>not just that it fits in there but that it fits in there while humans are on earth. a few million years ago and it was too close for a perfect fit in a few million years from now it will be too far away for a perfect fit. the fact that it is a perfect fit in the time when humans can use this to better observe the sun and space and it is all so damn perfect it is Ludacris. 
<|endoftext|>Okay, I read the link.. I get the basics in reference to the crates and whatnot, but what, exactly does this whole theory express? I don't want to buy the book.
<|endoftext|>lol what? just what? the moon doesn't cool objects in its light. what? the sun and the moon are not the same thing. you can see them both in the same sky at the same time. what kind of primitive thinking are you using here?
<|endoftext|>You do relatise that Pluto has a moon, Charon, that's quite similar in size to Pluto itself? I know it's been desclasified as a planet, but it's a celestial object with another just as large as itself in orbit around each other. 
<|endoftext|>You do relatise that Pluto has a moon, Charon, that's quite similar in size to Pluto itself? I know it's been desclasified as a planet, but it's a celestial object with another just as large as itself in orbit around each other. 
<|endoftext|>Suggest it for the next one! Better yet, compile some info and make your own post! I think a more general "anomalous ancient sites" topic would be a great future round table. For example, [here's some stuff I found out about Puma Punku]( an amazing site in Bolivia.tbh, the civilizations associated with these sites and the origin of the moon might be more related that you might think (we're supposed to be going high octane, right?).After all, Aristotle wrote of an ancient people called the "Proselenes" who lived in Arcadia and who were said, by the very nature of their name, to have lived "before there was a moon in the sky".Some writers (ie the authors of Who Built the Moon?) think future humanity literally went back in time to put the moon there. 
<|endoftext|>I see 38 votes for moon anomalies, 5 for phobos anomalies, and 10 for hollow earth which easily puts this topic at #1.
<|endoftext|>Lemme elaborate on this since ive read about in on the internet, when you die your spirit, not your soul, releases its grip on the body, causing a release of heat, this heat will carry your spirit to the moon where the moon will absorb and digest it, your spirit will cease to exist, BUT, if you managed to develop a soul from the seed that is your spirit in your lifetime you will be able to choose wether to stay in our solar system within the ifluence of the sun as a soul, to feed the moon consciously, or to travel straight into the sun and become one with our creator, that is what ive read, yes what a crock of shit
<|endoftext|>thats the craziest thing I've ever heard that gets thrown around a lot. Don't believe that nonsense, it's to instill fear.
<|endoftext|>The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory. If the moon was formed by material ejected from the earth in a collision, then that material would have come from the crust of the earth, not the earth's denser core. The collision formation theories are most accepted, but vary from what objects collided with the earth to form the moon. Seismometers placed on the moon in the 1970's, though, recorded the moon "ringing like a bell." By this time we'd landed on the darn thing and still weren't convinced the moon was solid. Of course, the argument can be made that a society sophisticated enough to craft a moon sized space station could sufficiently camouflage it to fool the primitives who live on the host planet.  
<|endoftext|>I have heard the moon being translucent and stars being seen through the unlit half of the moon but never witnessed this or ever seen pictures/video of it. I imagine with all the eyes in the world looking up at the moon that we would have some pictures out there of stars in the dark side of the moon but they just don't exist. I have a telescope and can see the unlit half of the moon during the day. its always there and it has never appeared to be see through any time I have ever looked at it. 
<|endoftext|>Whoever built the pyramids had a clear understanding of the size of the earth and the moon.That's not proof they understood the size of the Earth and Moon, just that they were able to produce a pyramid with a set of dimensions that squared the circle. The Earth and Moon do the same "coincidentally", but someone on Earth could figure out those proportions and admire their mathematical elegance *on their own* without ever looking up at the sky.
<|endoftext|>Considering the moon is the ONLY moon that is perfectly round, faces its planet with the same side always,Both of those statements are wrong. There are plenty of perfectly spherical moons in the solar systems, name just about any moon of a jovian planet and its likely to be spherical. Also, Pluto and Charon are tidally locked (which is the term for when a moon orbits at the same speed of its rotation so one side is constantly facing the planet) to one another. I think there are a few other cases of tidal locking in the solar system as well. 
<|endoftext|>Yeah...a satellite. Arabs before being Muslims were venerating the Moon...see 3/4 of muslim countries flags and coat of arms featuring quarter moons.So you're saying there was a a satellite of the moon in the 7th century?
<|endoftext|>Funny how some people put effort into finding patterns between numbers everywhere, yet don't put any effort into remembering (or even checking) for arguably the most know value of all, Pi. Says a lot about what their true aim is.Maybe if one would invest more time into understanding and less time into explaining, the world would be a better place.
<|endoftext|>Whilst the eclipse conjoins his Ascendant/Mars conjunction, Saturn at 21.11 Sagittarius is exactly on his Moon at 21.12 Sagittarius. This eclipse, which so exactly replicates Trumps chart, and which casts a shadow over the whole of the USA was a clear, unequivocal indication that he would win the 2016 election, but I dont think any astrologer spotted it at the time. But now that the eclipse darkens his chart, and the USA, will this be good or bad?
<|endoftext|>It was Joe McMoneagle. Ingo Swann did write an amazing book (That you can find for free online as a pdf) called 'Penetration' In which he remote viewed the dark side of the moon. And what he found was amazing. He also talks about the strange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water, ect.If you guys are interested in this stuff please check out my sub r/projectstargate I also have a video interview posted of McMoneagle talking about that "Trip" to mars.
<|endoftext|>The Mars/Jupiter papers are both great. Page 6 of the Jupiter paper discusses solar & planetary fission... something I hadn't heard of outside of Van Flandern. Thanks! 
<|endoftext|>Is that the prevailing theory in cosmology? Is it just the assumed natural evolution of the solar system? i.e. What would happen if nothing dramatic occured astronomically to affect the earth's motion? Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing? Anyhow, it doesn't explain the biological clock. 
<|endoftext|>Length is gradually increasing over time, okay, but that ignores my suggestion that an astronomical event dramatically decreased it at some time in the past.
<|endoftext|>that's flawed, the nuclear war he talks about apparently gouged out massive canyon's and is singlehandedly responsible for the fact mars is a desert wasteland now, hell it used to have oceans, to assume anyone beyond the very rare bunker or statue or temple, and i mean VERY rare, is absolutely absurd. Although i like the way you think. 
<|endoftext|>now this i can get behind. perhaps its a cloaking device that keeps amateur astronomers from seeing the cities and bases built there
<|endoftext|> maybe what we think is a rock in space is something else entirelyLike an alien observation station and its off limits for humans.
<|endoftext|>This is actually one of the better theories out there. Thank you for a very fresh alternative perspective.I do remember a certain researcher (God I forgot the name, I think he had some really long lectures on the Moon and Mars on Youtube) discuss how probes sent to the Moon hit a giant wall before coming to a halt. As if there were structures on the Moon. Built by aliens? Built by ancient humans? Current humans? Who knows, it is an interesting theory though.
<|endoftext|>interesting, it could also be waves caused by a change in temperature in the layer between moon and layers of atmosphere or there is a layer of water between us and the moon layer.
<|endoftext|>If the equipment causes it, why does the 'wave' go out of frame in one video where he pans, then it reappears in the frame from the bottom edge without having changed speed or angle, exactly where it would have been if he hadn't panned? EDIT: [video here]( don't see how this clip is compatible with that redditor's explanation. The wave phenomenon seems to be totally decoupled from any equipment effects.
<|endoftext|>That's not an explination. I've never heard about this stuff until today, but if you watch [this video]( about a third of the way through it he shows how the camera will pan and the wave will not pan with it, which clearly shows it's something external to the device. The only explination that makes any sense in light of that information is that it's atmospheric. 
<|endoftext|>Sure it is a good explanation but that doesn't mean that single comment discredits the entire thing, and what helps back my thought up is the comment below it blindly accepts it so quickly. 
<|endoftext|>sorry but that's not the same effect. your example shows the entire image effected. like when you take a pic when your phone vibrates. the moon wave is completely different bc the entire photo doesnt vibrate. there is clearly a wave anomaly that is happening on the moon. the wave on moves across the surface. it pulses and is not constant as your effect describes. space above it not effected. its a sweeping wave that moves consistently across the surface and wraps the curvature of the moon. 
<|endoftext|>Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.
<|endoftext|>Looks to me like it's only on the moon though..if it was an atmospheric phenomenon, you'd see that wave in the space around the moon too
<|endoftext|> and they simply bounced offThey bounced off because it wasn't water, it was brine and of a higher density and buoyancy than water.
<|endoftext|>It's the atmosphere, dude. Gas is fluidic, just observe the behavior of air above pavement on a hot day. That's why it all looks like lights under water *from an Earth-situated telescope* but not from any videos from in space (assuming you believe any of them are real).
<|endoftext|> essentially in a prison planet, zoo, or some type of ant farm/sim city project.You are referring to Gnosticism. Where God is real, and the universe was created, but not by God but a kind of "malevolent force" with the hopes of separating consciousness and hiding from consciousness it's beginning/true power. This is the ancient religion that the Matrix movies are based around. I've always liked the water theory because it explains a lotLiterally impossible as red/blue shifting wouldn't be a thing and at a certain distance away from us stars would just not be visible (like just about any source of light not in our solar system).
<|endoftext|>well space isn't a true vacuum anyways, it has material that floats around. though if applying the holofractal theory, space is considered a type of matter
<|endoftext|>I want to find that video of the water in watet. I remember seeing years ago. The water had a current and waves. It was so wierd. I don't recall the part where they bounced off it though. It was some time ago.
<|endoftext|>I think if this was proven to not be atmosphere (as it's definitely not equipment related) then it would serve as proof that we're living in a simulated reality.
<|endoftext|>Or an illusion caused by temperature change, shifting air masses, water vapor or any host of atmospheric event- especially if the waves move from the bottom upward? 
<|endoftext|>search youtube for moon wave, there are plenty of other examples. It's really weird, looks like a video that's refreshing
<|endoftext|>I think you're taking that a good ways out of context. Since they're talking about seismic activity it reads as if he's referring to long, continued vibrations and shaking. Something like a handbell or even the vibrations felt after striking a bell. That doesn't necessarily mean it's hollow, just that he was describing the very long time frames of the tremors. 
<|endoftext|>Argument for a locality. These kind of pics cast doubt on their actual distance... This is part of how I startd to wonder if things are different than our education teaches us.
<|endoftext|>This kind of stuff more or less cherrypicks in various ways, between which celestial bodies are being compared, the grounds for comparison, and the relationships being found. For every one "Woah" relationship found, a hundred duds were thrown out.If you examine everything for all conceivable relationships, the biggest coincidence would be finding no coincidences.
<|endoftext|>Evolution doesn't happen by chance. Evolution is the result of natural selection. For your comparison to be true, there would had to have been many different shaped and sized moons orbiting Earth, yet now only one remains due to its specific shape and size.
<|endoftext|>I think it's pretty likely. The variety of breeds humans have been able to produce just by selective breeding kind of shows how we can make animals change to have certain traits. Now just do that but for millions of years and eventually the DNA will be so far apart that breeds won't be able to produce viable offspring anymore. 
<|endoftext|>So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat. So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members? Clearly all of this is created either way. Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is. I mean the flat earth has to be at the most likely to not exist out of 100's. I doubt 10% on /conspiracy believe it's flat. There's just so much evidence from pictures of the Earth from space. I don't think any of it has to do with religion. The Roman Catholics did get very corrupt just after a few hundred years though so I wouldn't put it past them to lie to scare people into giving money.
<|endoftext|>I have the same attitude towards the flat earth theory as you do. If it were flat, I don't think it just be so NASA can rack in cash. I believe it would be hundreds of years before NASA was even born, that the deception would have started. But then we have People like Newton who would also have to be a lie.Too me, as a guy who's only watched like 20 mins about it, maybe the earth is simply bigger then what they tell us? Apparently NASA means to deceive in Hebrew. Huge if true.
<|endoftext|>I read the Bible 3 times a year cover to cover brother. I've only seen support for a round earth over and over and over in the Bible.
<|endoftext|>Even [the Wikipedia page]( for the equatorial ridge is pretty explicit:It is not clear how the ridge formed. One difficulty is to explain why it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are at least four current hypotheses, but none of them explains why the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio.It's easily one of the most incredible unexplained things we've discovered in our solar system.The ring "Chicken Little" theory [was suggested by]( *Discover* Magazine:The *Discover* article points out that the theory has not yet been "peer reviewed", but there it is. We're being asked to believe on the basis of a computer-claptrap model that the ridge "fell from the sky" after "rings" were formed around the planet, rings which were unstable, and which fell into the surface of the planet.Uh huh. What about those three parallel grooves? Were there three neatly parallel ring unstable ring systems?There's actually *another* theory that "Iapetus may have possessed its own moon that became tidally shredded to create a ring system that eventually fell to the moon's surface."OK...a moon with a moon which became tidally shredded to form a neat ring, which was unstable, which then fell to Iapetus' surface and formed that neat equatorial ridge. And, presumably, became shredded in such a way to form three closely bunched parallel rings in three planes which were all unstable and then fell to the planetary surface?Would Iapetus have had sufficient force to be able to shred its own moon? Can we see what the possible mass of that moon may have been? Would it have been enough to create the equatorial ridge?"But whatever the source, it seems scientists are agreeing that Iapetus couldn't have created the mountain range without some help from up above."I don't know about you, but that strikes me as yet another tongue in cheek remark. "Help from above?" Help implies helpers. Helpers implies intelligence. Intelligence implies......on yea, we can't go there. The ridge has been "explained." Perfectly natural. Nothing to see here...move along, it fell from the sky after a moon was tidally shredded to form an unstable ring system which collapsed and fell on poor Iapetus....
<|endoftext|>You are right, he definitely has a chip on his shoulder. He is brilliant, however. He is responsible for smuggling Pentium computer chip tech to the Soviets early nineties...
<|endoftext|>I think this one is from the Stellar Metamorphosis theory. Basically, the universe is a lot older than 13.8 billion years... possibly eternal. And all planets are formed from the eroded leftovers of stars.According this this theory, the sun would be the youngest object in our solar system. Jupiter would be a fair bit older. Earth would be a lot older and Mercury is absolutely ancient.
<|endoftext|>That other physicist that people post here theorized that everything is a black hole and all we see are the event horizons 
<|endoftext|>Orbiting the moon is certainly impractical. For parking asteroids for mining purposes, the earth-moon lagrange points L4 and L5 would make a lot more sense, though I'm not sure how viable"landing" something the size of substantial asteroid into those points would be; on-site extraction might just be more practical than moving the entire asteroids.
<|endoftext|>Why don't planets stop spinning then, as they are like moons to the sun?Do other planets moons not rotate?Edit: Found this cool article:  which provides info towards my second question. Interesting stuff
<|endoftext|>Too thin an atmosphere to support liquid water or greenery as we know it.What is you PhD in? Where do you base this on? When accredited scientists have proven otherwise. There is not.Edited:Prove to me that the moon is a natural satellite. I can, and will debunk this. History books on the moon are, and have been re written. New evidence trumps old theories.
<|endoftext|>What about the 3 Apallo spacecraft that were fuelled, and ready to bring men back to the moon, that were left to rust. We have the money to go back. We already spent some. But TPTB refuse to. Why is that? You said "If only there was funding." Like our fiat monetary system couldnt establish that. We dont go back to the moon for a very exact reason.
<|endoftext|>I can elaborate on this. The moon's distance and size relative to the earth is almost too coincidental to be naturally occurring. There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest the moon is either hollow or severely honeycombed. There are records in some extremely ancient cultures of certain peoples being around 'before the moon'. There is no theory for the formation of the moon that makes sense, the impact theory is something championed by most people but they don't read the next paragraph of that theory which states that an almost equal impact would have been necessary directly after to correct course and spin. The is a very compelling case that the moon isn't naturally occurring. If you're interested read a book called 'Who built the moon' by Christopher Knight. Very interesting, although their conclusions leave something to be desired. The theory that it was flown here has risen from a combination of these different anomalies. It would make sense to place a large body like the moon around a planet a species was interested in interacting with, sort of like hiding in plain sight. The notion that the moon isnt naturally occurring gives credence to this. Of course it's just a theory, there is no conclusive proof it is a type of space ship. But then again, if there was conclusive proof this topic wouldn't be in the conspiracy subreddit ;). 
<|endoftext|>Well at least you understood my small effort to inject a little humour. The original meaning of "lunatic" actually meant being under the spell of the Moon or "Luna" which is it's ancient name, like the ancient one for the Sun which is "Sol" from which we get solar, solstice, etc.The French word for the moon still is "la Lune" and there were of course people in ancient times who worshipped the Moon and "Diana" who was the goddess of the Moon and was believed to live on the Moon and they used to dance and frolic under the light of the full Moon in their outdoor ceremonies dedicated to her. And then there's the whole business about moonlight being romantic and people falling in love in the moonlight.And the Moon is very strange and mysterious and we really don't know very much about it and a whole lot of people really are utterly fascinated by the whole business... almost to the point of being under a spell by it.But there can't be any of those "lunatics", here, now can there? Or maybe I should have said "moon-atics"? 
<|endoftext|>The astronomers no longer consider Pluto to be a planet for a number of valid reasons and it's difficult to say what either Pluto and Charon actually are at this point. If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the two and they both actually orbit around a point in space *between them* that actually traces their path around the Sun. It's unusual because that point between them is closer to Pluto giving Charon an outer orbit around that point and Pluto taking an inner orbit around it on the opposite side of it as if they were rigidly connected through that point in their motions. So it isn't any typical planet/moon arrangement but two bodies orbiting an invisible point as if they were both moons going around it. Their tumbling orbit around the Sun as they wheel around it together is also highly unusual and brings them even closer to the Sun than Neptune is throughout parts of it probably because they weren't created by or with our system but rather captured and pulled into that off-kilter orbit after being cast-off from another system beyond ours.
<|endoftext|> The moon is less dense than earth, which actually supports the hollow moon theory.How? If it were hollow, how could it have a density of 3.34 g/cm^3 ? If the moon was formed by material ejected from the earth in a collision, then that material would have come from the crust of the earth, not the earth's denser core. The collision formation theories are most accepted, but vary from what objects collided with the earth to form the moon.Okay? Seismometers placed on the moon in the 1970's, though, recorded the moon "ringing like a bell."By this time we'd landed on the darn thing and still weren't convinced the moon was solid.The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moisture. Not because the moon is hollow. Of course, the argument can be made that a society sophisticated enough to craft a moon sized space station could sufficiently camouflage it to fool the primitives who live on the host planet.Certainly, but that could be said about literally anything around us.
<|endoftext|>Yeah. I've heard the distance increases the rate of recession, so it's 4cm/year now, but a million years from now it could be 1km/year (just making up numbers to explain)But yes right now the sun and moon share the same apparent diameter. In the distant future that won't be the case anymore, making total solar eclipses impossible.

<|endoftext|>What do you mean bystrange but proven facts of the moon such as how it has an atmosphere, Wind, Greenery, Water,
<|endoftext|> Or, is there evidence of this rate of rotation decreasing?Yes, [we've measured it decreasing]( 
<|endoftext|>Not really _my_ theory, just a thought I love to entertain, simply for the beauty of it (the continent coasts don't only fit where the Atlantic is, but also where the pacific is). "[Expanding Earth]( gives nice search results on YouTube, and it seems to overlap here and there with "Electric Universe"/"Plasma Universe" approaches to cosmology. Interesting trivia: it _precedes_ Wegeners plate tectonics theory by almost a century :)
<|endoftext|>I've found the moon rabbit hole is deep and one of the most disturbing, because dealing with the implications of all the strangeness, coincidences, and anomalies having to do with the moon is so far-reaching it can shake the foundations of everything you think you know.Crrow777, the man who captured the first video of the lunar wave, has a good Youtube [channel]( if you want to dive in. You can search for "moon" in his videos, but he delves into a lot more. This guy will have you questioning everything.
<|endoftext|>You are thinking of Phobos, a moon of Mars.The Soviets sent 22 probes, none sent back useful info - one is even rumoured to have filmed a rocket leave the surface and impact the Soviet's probe.
<|endoftext|>There's a great video of (amateur?) rocket equipped with outer camera going from surface of the earth to zero gravity. It's almost as if it hits the water. Google it.
<|endoftext|> also explained. He rotated the camera with respect to the 'field' and corrected the image with editing software or a field rotation prism in the telescopeYou are probably right on and in one of his videos he says he done exactly as you say, rotating the camera then turning the image back right with editing software.
<|endoftext|>He's saying that since the camera is on earth (and in Florida in this particular video), the heat in earth's atmosphere may cause a visible ripple. 
<|endoftext|>no the moon but OUR atmosphere here on Earth. we are looking through it to the moon which distorts its image slightly. thats my take on it. Not that the moon is hot
<|endoftext|>That's assuming the wave covers the entire length of the cameras POV, which translates to thousands of miles. Stars twinkle all the time precisely because of these atmospheric waves, but they don't twinkle in unison because these shifting densities are smaller in scale than that.
<|endoftext|>No, we wouldnt expect to see it on the dark area around the moon -- there is no light from there reaching our eyes. 
<|endoftext|>Too bad the heat waves coming up from the ground are in a randomized chaotic pattern, not a formulated straight forward line like on the moon. Riddle me that.
<|endoftext|>It's so hard to find the real video with the researchers talking about it, it was intentionally deleted I believe by the BBC and they were able to have youtube delete basically all the uploads. That's one of those things where you have to wonder what is so damaging about that account from a scientist that they went to that much effort to erase it entirely. Much like antarctica, there is much hidden about the deep ocean for unknown reasons, very little is allowed to be released to the public. 
<|endoftext|>perhaps, but what intrigues me is why the wave seems to follow the curvature of the moon rather than just traveling over 
<|endoftext|>It doesn't do that through a telescope. I've tried many times. I don't know if it's the atmosphere or the video camera but it isn't the moon. I know that for sure. It's real and round 100%. I know this is /conspiracy but I have a lot of friends with big telescopes. 
<|endoftext|>Sweet! I do that too! I just need a better camera to mount on my lens. Right now it's decent but maybe half the quality as these vids. It's really cool to have a telescope with GPS hooked up to a camera recording on your laptop. 
<|endoftext|>way to take what they said out of context. seismic activity needs shifting plates. considering NASA previous statements about the moon, I think "rang like a bell" has a literal connotation. 
<|endoftext|>Hmm, let me try to be as clear as possible. The body you are in now is actually a physical projection from a different state, ..though it's not so much a state as it is a different area of our consciousness. The only difference between your waking and dreaming self is that while waking we separate from that area of dreaming. And in doing so project a dream reality apart from it. The key to understanding our planets and moons and space in general is that it is a reflection of our focus. As we are projecting into this dream we agree on a focus. A template. A model. And this 'entering into' as a focus here, during that entering the focus adopts the model and projects it as a reality. So when most think of planets having an effect on us, or that they were the results of God's or scientific Theories... that is the complete opposite of what is actually happening. The human consciousness is reflecting itself as a layered reality. Dense physical waking self in one area, and then light astral body dreaming self, or space, as another layer of consciousness.
<|endoftext|>Yes, this is pretty similar to theists saying that the low odds of our planet being in the goldilocks zone is proof of a designer. 
<|endoftext|>Perhaps even evolution isn't happening by chance. It could be that all of reality, including all of nature is communicating with itself on a quantum level in closed systems - thus creating grounds for an intelligent evolution, with intelligent mutations, not entirely random ones. One where "Intelligent design" isn't done by a Deity, but by nature itself.This is supported by the /r/holofractal theory of the Universe (not yet validated by mainstream science and probably missing some parts and connections to make it so, but I do feel it is a step in the right direction).
<|endoftext|>I do understand evolution. Be honest, the odds of life evolving on this planet or anywhere else in the universe are just as improbable as the uniqueness of our planet's moon. Improbable but not impossible. You should learn to appreciate that. 
<|endoftext|>So because the Bible says the Earth is round even when everyone else thought it was flat. So the Catholic church figured if people realized it was flat they wouldn't believe in God so it started a conspiracy to this day to get more church members? Clearly all of this is created either way. Either we are creating this reality, or another entity is.That isn't my understanding. My impression from speaking with flat-earthers is that the bible says the earth is circular, but not "round" in the way you mean it. They all believe that the bible strongly implies that the earth is flat and round (circular). They believe that the push towards thinking the earth is a globe and could have formed naturally is specifically to make people believe that a god isn't required for the earth to exist, while a flat earth could not form naturally and is proof of gods design.Not that there aren't flat-earthers who aren't religious, but that's really been the only motive I've heard for this supposedly huge cover-up

Mainstream physics: the edge of the universe is similar to an event horizon, and the schwarzschild radius of something with the mass of the estimated mass of the universe would be about the radius of the observable universemy madness: we are inside a black hole, collapsing. The reason we see an expanding universe is simply that we perceive time as the direction where entropy increases. It's arbitrary whether we are collapsing or expanding.
<|endoftext|> What is you PhD in? Where do you base this on? You don't need a PhD to check the phase diagram for water. When accredited scientists have proven otherwise.Cite your sources, this would be the news of the century in every scientific journal, I've yet to see it.  Prove to me that the moon is an artificial satellite. I can, and will debunk this. So you're arguing against yourself now? 
<|endoftext|>I love moon mythology. I remember reading this YouTube transcription of Stichens Sumerian tablets, and how the Anunnaki were always enamoured by our moon. Perhaps they were amazed because they knew it was fake but they themselves didn't build it? Whoa dude. Aliens upon aliens! That said, let's be scientific. If the moon IS FAKE, how can we test and prove it? Is it falsifiable? If we trace time back, can we figure out when the move actually arrived? I posted a thought earlier to wondering when our lunar eclipse used to PERFECTLY eclipse the sun? Is there something interesting about that date? If it was designed to perfectly eclipse, why? What technological advantage would that present? Perhaps it needs constant reorbiting to keep it in the perfect eclipse range but after its creators/operators left, it has been spiralling outwards ever since? HOLY fucking shit...  last paragraph seems to indicate that TREX would have seen a full eclipse..... 50 million years from now we won't have total eclipses anymore.. Therefore it happened around 50 or 60 say million years ago.. Did the moon kill the dinosaurs? Yeah, lock me up I've officially gone insane lol
<|endoftext|> If I'm not mistaken Charon is the much larger of the twoYou are mistaken. they both actually orbit around a point in space between themThat's because Charon is such a large moon, that it's fucking with Plutos position. 
<|endoftext|> The reason it 'rings like a bell' is because it's composed of more solid, rigid materials, unlike the Earth, which is composed of materials that have far more moistureYou seem pretty certain of that, would you mind explaining where you get that from? Because the moon ringing is established fact. The composition would be based on a handful of moon rocks brought back. One seems far more reliable than the other. Don't take this as a personal attack but it sounds like you aren't willing to entertain the idea the moon is hollow despite compelling evidence that it is. Edit: You did post where you got that from, my mistake for not reading further down. However I read your pdf article. When we theorize the moon is hollow I think you misinterpret what we mean by hollow. It still has something it it's core, the mass in between the surface and the core is evidenced to be either hollow or honeycombed. There is still a core if course because there is still a magnetic field. In fact none of the sources you posted provide a reliable theory for the composition of the moon. That's because there isn't one. The conclusion of the article assumes the impact formation theory, which is in no way reliable or certain. In fact you might be interested to know that the only way the impact theory for the formation of the moon can be correct is if there was a second almost identical impact afterwards. Science based on assumptions is just that. Again, don't take this as a personal attack, it's not. But throwing shade around like; but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollowWhen your conclusions are based on assumed theories you can't be certain of them. The attitude you are taking is kind of the opposite of the scientific process which you seem to champion so strongly.
<|endoftext|>Dude, I am not a physicist. I got that from Wikipedia. After reading some of the material linked, I gather the difference in density between the earth and the moon despite them being made up of the same material as the earth (theoretically, same materials would have the same density) tends to support the theory that the moon is hollow in the center. But, if the moon was formed from less dense crust or mantle material and not the more dense iron that makes up the core of the earth, that could account for the difference in density. Rather than a compact planet with a solid core surrounded by spinning molten metal, the moon is a loose collection of dust and debris held together by loose gravitational bonds making it less dense than earth. Doesn't make it hollow. Makes it less dense. I'm not arguing the moon is hollow. I'm just sharing information about the theory.
<|endoftext|> original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetA) how the hell would you know the original height to such a specific degree andB) I find no source saying it was that height, it just seems to be convenient to your next equation rather than a representation that's accurate. According to wikipedia it was 480.6 ft. 
<|endoftext|>Did they use miles and feet at this time? I like your theory but i wonder if this would still work in the measuring units of their time.
<|endoftext|>The dimensions of the Giza pyramid correspond to dimensions of our planet and the moon at a scale of 1 to 432,000. The sun has a radius of 432,000 miles.How does the pyramid correspond to the the Earth and the Moon at the same scale? It doesn't.original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feetBest idea for the original height is 480.6 feet or 280 Egyptian cubits480.6 * 432,000 = 207619200 = 39321.8181818 miles 3,938.685 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 11 miles, or an error of about 0.2%)39321.8181818 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 35372 miles or an error of about 90%) you'll probably have to add some crap about ratios or factors in there.You might as well use the real numbers. Also love the how the pyramid is accurate to 4 decimal places but you're happy to use 432,000 instead of 432287.938 which is the Suns actual radius in miles and good to let slide errors in measuring the polar radius. Could that be because none of your magic maths would work otherwise?
<|endoftext|>Fun fact / Maybe we're going too far : the A note used to be 432 hertz before we set it up to 440 relatively recently
<|endoftext|>Yeah man, I was just enjoying some kooky dooky arguements about the Cloud People, and wherever the fuck the moon came from.

<|endoftext|>I have a pretty damn good telescope, and I can tell you for a fact there is not 'greenery' on the moon.
<|endoftext|>Those are indeed strange facts. Since most think the moon is a dead/natural satellite.But all of those things listed have been proven as fact. Most back in the 70s. But you see them crop through the news now and again as they are "rediscovered"
<|endoftext|>I love the idea of flipping everything we know around, because all I feel they need is hidden tech, and they can tell all the lies they want. I know it's not healthy to always think the world is against you, but it helps when you remember it's all of us regular (if you don't want me grouped with you that's cool) people against the ambiguous "them".But I take breaks here and there and enjoy time with friends to solidify myself here and not lose grip.Strange times ahead for sure. 
<|endoftext|>Phobos is little more than very large rock. It's about the length of Manhattan. Gravity is near enough to nil that anything living on it would be better off just living in zero-g. 
<|endoftext|>There are many good leads but this is probably not one of them. Look up how they "de-spin" rockets which normally spin in order to maintain some orientation. Absolute linear speed changes are not going to be easy detect with no reference frame.
<|endoftext|>I'm unconvinced.How does field rotation correlate with a phenomenon that appears to track across the visible moon both before and after the field of view pans?If you feel field rotation is enough then perhaps you can break down how it caused the specific observed effect even after the pan, addressing each of these points:1. The telescope captures a "wave" apparently between the moon and the telescope lens propagating at a constant speed and direction.2. The telescope is panned such that the "wave" is out of the visible frame.3. The "wave" catches up with the visible frame, re-entering from the bottom edge where we would expect it to be if the camera had not panned, and then continues at the same constant speed and direction until reaching the top edge of the moon.
<|endoftext|>I thought a chap in Germany had independently verified his observation?This is a relatively new phenomenon. I'm open-minded about waiting for more evidence. I'm not saying it's real, but to say outright that it's a fraud is a conclusion without evidence too.
<|endoftext|> Not that the moon is hotthe temperature on the surface of the moon hit by the sun can reach over 250F
<|endoftext|>Believe in things that can produce results. I 'believe' in many aspects of science because they produce direct, observable results. As for the moon being a hologram? Makes no sense, how could we predict tides if the moon didn't have mass. Moon bases and moon settlements/cities? I doubt it just like everything else. Extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence, etc. but I don't dismiss it, because I have no way to know one way or the other. 
<|endoftext|>consider things as probability/possibility. belief is a tough one. you can have faith in a thing. apply the sceintific method to a thing. things are harsh. learn as much as you can. it always pays off. 
<|endoftext|>This is hardly meant to be a conclusive argument, but the reason the waves appear chaotic above asphalt is the proximity of high heat makes a lot of displacement waves in the air, which collide into the chaos we're used to seeing. At higher altitudes, few waves would be generated and are less likely to collide, so it's possible to see it keep a consistent angle and velocity.Source: B.S. in physics and a lot of recent experience with wave/sound mechanics
<|endoftext|>Yea, and I can't find decent information on it. I want to study the virtual reality aspect of reality or at least things like the moon.I don't know anything about Antarctica other than they seem to be pretty secretive over that place.I can't figure out what the reasoning would be by tricking people it's round if it's flat though. Even if it is flat, what does that really change or matter? 
<|endoftext|>Nonsense. BBC licensing agreements with YouTube doesnt mean shit. You can still read the papers these scientists wrote. Why not just send them an email?
<|endoftext|>Tbh I think its most likely an artifact of digital recording. It would constantly be refreshing the contrast between the white and the black- i.e, the edge. Does anyone have footage of this shot with a non-digital film camera? Have these things been seen with the human eye or is it just something that happens if you zoom a digital camera at the moon long enough ?
<|endoftext|>It *doesn't* follow the curvature. It's more pronounced on the vertical side of the moon and by the time it gets to the top horizontal line it's imperceptible , and *doesn't* come back down the other side. That's exactly what I'd expect if a ripple was moving from down to up in the atmosphere between the observer and the moon.
<|endoftext|>So who or what are other people? If their real, why doesn't their dream focus affect my dream too? 
<|endoftext|>How is that? Firstly, the odds aren't really that low, and secondly, that would mean that even if it is low, it's still probable without a creator. 
<|endoftext|>If a higher dimension entity isn't a designer that how is this being created, by our own minds? Lol I wonder if Mario and Luigi are atheists. 
<|endoftext|>Eh that's different though since life should only likely observe itself to be in a place that is suitable for life to be. So like, while our planet is certainly extremely rare it should be extremely common that any life that exists exists in the rare suitable places for it.The eclipse lining up at the same time humans start recording history has no obvious necessity.
<|endoftext|>The usual argument for this is like the anthropic principle. The planets where it didn't happen there is no one to complain about it, the odds of us being on a planet where we evolved are 100%. The moon isn't like that. Some aspects of it might be, such as stablizing the axis of rotation and the climate stablity that comes with that. The convenient eclipse size is just fun though. It's proportionally much larger than moons around other planets. And it's not a uniform density either, attempts to orbit probes very closet to the surface failed due to anomalies in the gravitational field much larger than anywhere on earth. I don't know about the "moon wave" thing, this is the first time I saw that.
<|endoftext|>as a christian, that sounds absolutely ridiculous. you might as well say the Earth is actually a square as "proof" of intelligent design
<|endoftext|>I don't mean a perfect circle. I need to check that thread on how many people do believe the Earth is flat.We can go to the "edge" if that's the case ourselves. No one is guarding the entire edgle. It's just 1000's of years this conspiracy has gone on with no one messing up. We go into space and take pictures of the moon, and from satellites. I hope we all know even if we didn't go to the moon we were in space near it. I think they walked on the moon.
<|endoftext|>No, the Bible supports a round Earth that isn't at the center of the Universe. I can get the scripture. I just went through a lesson on this.
<|endoftext|>I wanted to look into this more as I e never heard of it and I found this.  seems those rocks are still really cool, but not all that mysterious. 
<|endoftext|>it has been, mainstream science has blacklisted alien/religious theorist's and tons of these theorists have said this, any evidence they find is usually laughed off, and often only published on websites like this or personal websites, and if you ask most informed people, which I've done, and probably shouldn't have because it's done wonders for my reputation i'm sure, they'll tell you how obvious it is that most mainstream scientists won't even humor alternative science, only doing so when it gets popular. 
<|endoftext|>The Moon is a pretty deep rabbit hole :). And it leds you down the path of realising that we know almost nothing about cosmology, and that most of our theories on it are at odds with new data almost on a monthly basis. Personally I'm convinced the Moon isn't real in the sense it is an organicly occurring satellite, I believe it was very much put there, by whom I can't be sure. A shower thought I had the other day was that if there is a malignant alien presence exerting an influence over our species, and IF there is a galactic council or something similar trying to do something about it, it would make sense that the Moon being the craft the malignant aliens came here on would give them some sort of insurance against the tampering of their affairs but other species. "Hey you, stop messing with the humans and leave their world!", "Sure bro, we'll just take the Moon with us", "But that would be catastrophic!" "Then I guess stay out of our business."Not saying that's what I believe, just a thought I had ;).
<|endoftext|> You seem pretty certain of that, would you mind explaining where you get that from? Because the moon ringing is established fact.

<|endoftext|>Crow's videos were shared with the fine people studying atmospheric optics over at /r/atoptics and opinion was that the video was fraud or possibly a contrail. No one else observes this phenomenon.
<|endoftext|>if it were an artifact of digital recording the wave would likely move or change in state if the camera panned. If you look at the video [here]( he shows footage of the wave not moving with the camera as he pans quickly, and follows it's original trajectory as if unaffected by the camera itself.
<|endoftext|>Why do you insist on misquoting me? LOL. Conspiratards will tell any lie to support their delusions. 
<|endoftext|>I need to get a USB camera. Mine hooks up to my laptop and I can get it on my screen. I'll definitely record hours of footage. I looked for aliens for years and all I've ever seen is satellites. On my space forum 1000's of people who are experts (with telescopes, ones 30 feet tall some have built) all say they have never seen anything weird about the moon, any planet, or seen any UFO's. 
<|endoftext|>apparently people have only captured 11 waves so far on footage. and some occur near equinoxes or during lunar eclipses
<|endoftext|>It does. We all ripple out. Everything we do or believe , our thoughts, mental energy travels invisibly all around us, and we are in a sense biological antennae receiving it, and projecting it. Collectively we agree on what objects and forms will hold all the energy constantly overflowing from each person in this reality. The Sun is powered by us ,by our energy. The moon itself is a symbol of night, of dreams. we all agree on what we dream together, and the forms this will take.
<|endoftext|>Other people are their own consciousness. You or I are individual. You talking to me is your creation. Me talking to you is my creation. We each create our reality, but we cooperate. Just like we are doing. Only we also cooperate in ways we take for granted. Like we agree to agree there is a sun over our head and a moon trailing behind it. It's automatic, the stuff we take for granted is an automatic agreement. 
<|endoftext|>I don't think it's a valid argument, I was making the comparison to say that I don't think astronomical coincidences (size and position of Earth, of the moon and so on) are very meaningful. It's like a lottery in which each ticket has an equal and vanishingly small chance of winning but there must be a winner. Given that we have a moon it has to be one distance from the earth or another. Seeing its current position as somehow too "perfect" to be accidental is a very human-centric position. 
<|endoftext|>A common thought is that Antarctica is actually a seawall all around the flat earth that is a circle shape. This would explain the reason why all countries have forbidden Antarctic exploration on a mass scale. Then a dome, "the firmament", encloses our atmosphere. The firmament is in Genesis. 
<|endoftext|>Kinda hexagonal shaped. And there are other shapes that look like they could have been buildings. But this sounds like a very harsh environment, to harsh for life to exist. The spaceship theory was fun too, but I think we know enough about the make up of Ipateus to know that's not very likely either. But Im open for discussion, whats your theory if you think these were built? Why? or what purpose do they serve? 
<|endoftext|>I second this. I watched a presentation of his a few years back, thinking that it'd just be some more hollow earth ridiculousness. I did not expect to be convinced, but it was solid, well reasoned, and not full of the esoteric imaginative gibberish that most hollow earth stuff has.
<|endoftext|>"but there are people who actually perpetuate the nonsense that it is hollow."Thought we were discussing "theories" here?  In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory. Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief. I know what the moon is made of. I can Google scientific papers all day long. That's not what I want to do. I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories. But no. You come in here all Logical and link all your "peer reviewed" research from accredited publications. Great. Thanks. You've ruined this for me. 
<|endoftext|>They used cubits and other things I can't remember the names of... furlongs? Idk, but the thing is, the units weren't standardized; like a master mason might have his set of measuring sticks passed down from his father who he apprenticed under, and maybe even his grandfather etc, but his would be slightly different than another masons tools although they would both measure a cubit. It wouldn't really matter, as long as they stick with one per structure so it has standardized units of measurement throughout; it would be a pain in the ass to renovate a building you didn't originally build though... Anyways, my point is that it would be damn near impossible to align structures to true north or whatever down to the last micrometer like people insinuate when they talk about these things when everyone is essentially using a unique measurement unit, I'd assume that they're pretty damn close but not perfect.
<|endoftext|>So you think there are green (read about chlorophyll) plants on the *dark side* of the moon? You understand why that wouldn't make sense, right?
<|endoftext|> Sure. I will only use new sources found from Google. But if you read his book, you will find many more sources from years ago.  Atmosphere:   Proof of atmosphere, means proof of Wind.  Greenery: I can't find anything on Google. Please read the book for that one.  Water:   There are many more strange, yet provable occurrences on the moon as well.
<|endoftext|>Sure. I will only use new sources found from Google.

<|endoftext|>No, because there arent ten other people.Thousands of years of Astronomy and one dude observes this phenomenon and no one else? Lol
<|endoftext|>It doesn't matter what he believes. The video evidence stands on its own, until it is properly debunked. His personal views don't change the footage, and trying to discredit that evidence just because you disagree with him on other things is pretty closed minded.
<|endoftext|>Ah interesting, I thought you meant fraud as in the moon is a fraud. He claims some of the videos are from other people but who knows if that's true

<|endoftext|>Sad, wonder why there used to be so much activity and now almost nothing. There are some theories saying they camouflage themselves somehow, need IR camera and stuff like that.But I suppose who knows at this point, you could make a bunch of theories up from that, maybe they're grouping up somewhere, preparing?Wishful thinking I know, besides we have those who believe they are demons. 
<|endoftext|>I fully understand what the terminology means. The Matrix is way over populated. It is also not mega advanced tech wise. Some people who have a NDE can clearly see the "White Light" at death is completely staged and somewhat synthetic and even crappy. People all over the world have been experiencing "Glitches In The Matrix". From identical people, cars, locations and objects completely respawning, to the projection actually freezing and the characters and objects around them staying in place for numerous seconds.
<|endoftext|>It's a bit tautological too. If it wasn't "perfect" (e.g. close enough to evolve life that can get intelligent), we wouldn't be here to realize it. 
<|endoftext|>But how is it too perfect? Why would it being seemingly the same size as the sun in our sky bare any real significance? What does the fact that solar eclipses happen sometimes actually change in our lives, other than a few moments to go "oooo". The moon could be a different size or distance and tides would still happen, which is a much more significant phenomena to aid the growth and spread of life than eclipses. 
<|endoftext|>if i thought it was nonsense, i wouldn't have said it, and if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want but mainstream everything, from politics to science is constantly caught cheating, lying, stealing, and blackmailing as well as blacklisting things they don't like, only people who don't like the truth blindly believe they don't exclude narratives they don't like. 
<|endoftext|>yeah, i researched hollow theory quite a bit and did a presentation on it for my chemistry class for a pseudoscience assignment. it actually stirred my curiosity on to look into other "conspiracies." my conclusion is that until we have the technology to dig past our crust, we'd have to rely on assumptions given through how the seismic data is interpreated 
<|endoftext|> Thought we were discussing "theories" here? In discussing the theory we need to look at the origin of the theory and what information supports that theory. Then analyze it, talk about how or why people may use it to support their belief.There is no evidence that supports the moon being hollow, that is my point. I know what the moon is made of. I can Google scientific papers all day long. That's not what I want to do. I want to find new rabbit holes to run down and look at the origins of some of these more "nonsensical" theories.Again, that's fine, just don't pretend they are legitimate. Thanks. You've ruined this for me.Good, people need to spread actual knowledge rather than nonsense, otherwise we'll keep coming closer to a modern version of the Dark Ages ...
<|endoftext|>[Holy moly. It's not literally dark, dude. It's tidally locked & we only ever see one side. The moon has days and nights, just like us.]( #5
<|endoftext|>Uh I'm reading the book and so far all I can find is that he's citing other books, namely Jessup, Morris K. (1957). The Expanding Case for the UFO. New York: Citadel PressandStrange World of the Moon - 1962 (by VA Firsoff)Neither of these are in print.Swann refers to Firsoff as a top scientist and authority on the moon. This seems to a be a pretty strong embellishment based on what can be found about the man.MK Jessup is a better known ufologist who was at one point a PhD candidate but it's not clear that he ever finished his degree or worked in science in any capacity after that point.I'd say this is a pretty weak source overall.
<|endoftext|>Try thinking. Maybe the wave wasn't there thousands of years ago. Maybe they didn't have high def cameras.Try checking before making a blatantly false statement. This video shows 10 wave captures by people around the world. 
<|endoftext|>Do you really think that after thousands of years of observations only Crow77 has ever observed this phenomenon?Do you simply believe every video you see, even when that video contradicts the personal observation of BILLIONS of humans over thousands of years?Dude, think. Obviously fraud. 
<|endoftext|>I'm highly confident the "aliens" are fallen angels/demons. I've had a lot of contact with them since age 14 when it started. I brought a demon back from Peru and it will tell me it's name if I ask. It possessed me and I started stabbing myself with the Peruvian knife (turns out it's the Peruvian God of war carved on the knife and they pray over it).
<|endoftext|>its a bit far-reaching for me, but there are footage of planes stopping in the middle of air for a brief second before continuing. or planes simply vanishing like someone turned off a hologram
<|endoftext|>It's not tautological at all... cogito (or in this case, typito) ergo sum.I'm here, and no matter your belief in a fancy-shmancy CIA holo-projected universe, I really did type this, and this planet *is* a Goldilocks planet.And the chance that non-pernicious info is folded into every single species' DNA quadrillions of times, with a way to circumvent RNA's non-conforming-therefore-discarded policy is a number so large that it would require every molecule in the universe to count it out on a cosmic abacus.
<|endoftext|>Maybe it was created by people for people to wonder at, to block out the sun and show a display of power. IDK why you would involve religion/creationism at all unless that was your own neurosis.
<|endoftext|>Well their argument, which I think is fallacious, is that if quite a few of the conditions on earth weren't *exactly* as they are, we wouldn't be here. That may be true but all it means is that something else would be here. There's obviously no basis to believe someone or something arranged it this way to suit us. The argument seems to be assuming that there is something essential about human life and a universe without us would be a pointless mistake. 
<|endoftext|> if your counter is just calling me delusional or crazy that's not an argument. Call me stupid all you want  I didn't call you any of those things, but if you insist let's go ahead and put this to the test.  Show me one of these papers published on a website that was rejected from peer reviewed journals, which has empirical evidence of the Moon's atmosphere supporting liquid water and greenery. All it would take is a few spectroscopic measurements, anyone with access to a telescope and some basic equipment can carry that out and publish their data, so where is it? 
<|endoftext|>During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around. It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed. New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed. If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view. 
<|endoftext|>Huh. Fair point. Now can you suggest any reason why only the side we can't see would have vegetation?
<|endoftext|>Why do you need a camera? Because you cant fake waves on the actual moon, but you can on video.All these "waves" are all in the same video released by the same person, lol You are being duped by someone that pushes pseudoscience to get subscriptions. 
<|endoftext|>LOL I am still laughing about this. Where are the source videos, Crow? I cant believe you took that video seriously.
<|endoftext|>I'm not saying you're wrong. You could be right.Where is it implied or suggested that this phenomenon is "thousands of years old?" For all we know this was first observed in the last few years because that's when it started. What evidence do you have for a fraud, other than an absence of evidence for it being a real phenomenon? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.I'm not suggesting anything, just pointing out what we can all see on the video. If you can explain how to achieve these effects within the constraints and also explain how a third party independently observed them from a different location, with separate evidence for it, then we can call it debunked and carry on with our lives. 
<|endoftext|>I'm still open to entertain that idea, but there's also the possibility of that kind of thing being a "distraction" or "misinfo". I just honestly don't know what to give more credence to. The beings could be friendly and trying to help, but "they" don't want that, so they're demons or malevolent aliens. But on the flip side, they could be evil aliens or demons sure, and the people shouting the benevolent aliens idea could be trying to get us to trust these beings who mean harm. I'm just anxious about the future and hoping this is all coming to a culmination, but I know there have been others like me waiting for an "event" as well and they've died with nothing occurring. Let's hope there's something to this "Great" Eclipse and the 23rd that follows.EDIT: I also mean to try more psychedelics hopefully in the nearby future, I want to see what my consciousness has to say about all the information I have cooped up in there. 
<|endoftext|>But what I'm saying is why would anyone who would create the moon need to make it so eclipses are present. It has no real baring on how life came to be. 
<|endoftext|>Not to further an argument that I also find fallacious, but it isn't just conditions on earth. All of the constants in the universe (Speed of light, etc.) are so perfectly tuned that if they were changed by on millionth of a percent matter itself could not exist. It's pretty mind blowing.
<|endoftext|>oh, i don't believe the moon is hollow, or supports greenery, i'm insane, not delusional, yet, and it's fairly well admitted i believe that the moon has ice on it, you can literally just type in 'moon has ice?' i'm too lazy too bother, and drunk, but the liquid water thing is probably bull, although looking it up on google search brings up lots of times mentions of water vapor, so there might be a little. don't see what difference it makes. 
<|endoftext|> During the Dark Ages they burned people as witches because they believed the earth circled the sun and not the other way around.Yup, and people today are still stoned to death, and there were death camps in the 1990s ... we're not so far from history. It was literally a period in history where discussing science, alternative theories of evolution, cosmology and mathematics could get you killed. New ideas, new belief systems were harshly and violently suppressed. If anything is dragging us back to the Dark Ages, it's people like you who refuse to even discuss a different point of view.A completely discounted, illogical and nonsensical point of view. It's this kind of 'science sliding' that leads to the coal lobby and other anti-scientific scam artists to hold so much power, they take advantage of people who just want to "discuss a different point of view" and allow it to grow into a powerful minority which ultimately profits only a select few ...
<|endoftext|>Well, that's probably pretty unlikely. It has been shown that our moon has a trace atmosphere, iirc from impacts and outgassing, but it's pretty close to a vacuum. There is ice on the moon, and a trace of water vapor, and the moon is capable of holding a breathable atmosphere for (I think) thousands or tens of thousands of years.  And there are Apollo images that look like liquid water, and are kind of tough to explain away, but I would bet they are something else like impact glass or some other substance.  The moon is a trippy place.**But do I think the other side has air and vegetation? No.**  I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night side. Space is so freaky and counter-intuitive that I don't judge ignorance or superstition or conspiracy theories. 
<|endoftext|>Ok you have no idea what you're talking about. It's been captured over a dozen times, from multiple states and countries. But you stay ignorant in your brain cage of rigid skepticism so closed off you cant even learn anything new.
<|endoftext|>Blocking out the sun is a pretty badass thing to do? There's different degrees of significance between Complete Coincidence and Created by God. Maybe the Face on the Moon is actually there and it was to show an ancient civilisations perceived mastery over nature.
<|endoftext|>There are so many "coincidences" that it almost feels natural, you know what I mean. The fibonacci sequence and Pi happening so often in nature is mindblowing. 
<|endoftext|>Liquid water and greenery was the specific claim that I was refuting at the top of this comment thread. You were seemingly defending that point when you responded to my request for a citation.
<|endoftext|>Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there. 
<|endoftext|> I just like to pipe up when someone is thinkng the moon has a perpetually night sideYes, this was a pretty stupid assumption on my part. I can easily model it in my mind and see why it isn't the case. I just always took the name at face value I guess. It was an interesting lesson in my own ignorance.Edit: For instance, solar eclipses exist. I can be astoundingly stupid sometimes =)
<|endoftext|>yeah, i'm slowly getting more drunk, and honestly i don't really care about this anymore, i had to go over this statement like 3 times for errors, so have a good night, don't go to bed angry 
<|endoftext|> Ohhh, son, that's a big leap to suggest discussing reasons why people might believe the moon is hollow will lead to an unregulated coal industry.I think both prey on the same types of mindset. I get what you're saying, but I don't think you stuck the landing there.Certainly a stretch, but I do believe there is a significant 'trickle-down' effect when it comes to believing things for which there is no evidence.
<|endoftext|>Well no because it only effects me from my perspective lol. If i had a giant thumb and blocked out the sun for this hemisphere it would be seen as badass by some people. Especially if they worshipped the sun.
<|endoftext|>If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.Liiiiike, alternative fuels that might replace coal and other polluting fossil fuels. 
<|endoftext|> If we continued to simply accept what is known and proven, there's no impetus to discover new things.I'm not saying that we should only accept what is known and proven, I'm saying that once a theory has reached a point that there is zero evidence to support it and there are mountains of evidence against it, then it should be treated as such.
<|endoftext|>Yes, exactly, putting my thumb out to cover the sun does only effect my perspective. Are you using that as a metaphor or something?
<|endoftext|>Everything is just relative to where you are. Just like you and your thumb, that's sometimes the moon and the planet. 
<|endoftext|>Here's the FBI Records Vault release on Tesla they dropped like a year ago... has some great newspaper clippings about Death Rays and such... 
<|endoftext|> Zero Point: The Story of Mark McCandlish and the Fluxliner This guy Eric Dollard is trying to bring back some of Tesla's work and make them applicable to daily life. video does a WONDERFUL job at explaining Einstein's Theories and why they do not accurately portray how the universe behaves, and instead offers another theory that r/holofractal is largely based on. These principles are largely what made Tesla's work different.
<|endoftext|>Retired Lt. Col. Tom Bearden claims the EM theory taught in schools today is based on a truncated version of Maxwell's original equation set, and that the original version (not taught in EM schools and dismissed by detractors) may hold the keys to a unified field theory. In an interview, Mr. Bearden was asked why he does not personally pursue development of new forms of electric technology. His answer was simply "I want to live". He has however, left a trove of supposed knowledge that can form as a starting point for anyone interested in following the case.The original version of Maxwell's equation set included scalar terms that required a form of quanternion algebra to solve. Later mathematicians later "simplified" the equations into pure vectors (presumably for ease of use) but also assumed away other dynamic possibilities in our concept of the electric model. also could hold the mathematical keys to understanding SCALAR ELECTRIC energy that Tesla also wrote was the secret behind his wireless electric transmission technology and the basis of his Wardenclyffe tower. Many people make the mistake of thinking that the tower was an EM Hertzian wave emitter like a modern radio tower, which would be an inefficient design due to the power loss being a product of the inverse square law. The tower was actually designed to be in proportion with what was later discovered to be the Schumann resonance (Tesla discovered it first). The idea was to produce electric scalar waves in resonance with the Schumann cavity, which would be amplified by sympathetic constructive interference. It would produce standing (scalar) waves of electric power encompassing the entire earth and would be receivable at any point on the globe.This may also be the key to understanding the current conspiracy surrounding Russia's possible ability to disrupt the electrical systems of naval vessels, as evidenced by the USS Donald Cook incident in the Black Sea as well as two recent collisions involving US warships in the pacific within just two months. also found this interesting CIA doc showing awareness and a simple mathematic analysis of the above possibilities. added some stuff.
<|endoftext|>Exotic weapons (not just "ultra-sonic") being used against diplomats, and people think there's no way they can be used against high profile politicians or business people, against dissidents or the opposition.[A post I made]( about US embassy in Russia (Microwave affair)]( news:

<|endoftext|>About the subject of suppression of advanced technology. The U.S. government would not allow any technology to be invented by an individual that could pose a threat to its agenda. Image a group of people with tech more superior than the military that could overthrow the aristocracy. That would be a major pain in the butt to a shadow government that wants us all as their slaves.

<|endoftext|>Look up the connection between Trump's uncle (an MIT Physicist) who was given the task of sifting through Tesla's notes after he died. There are quotes from Donald saying his uncle showed him the notes. Pretty intriguing stuff
<|endoftext|>i have reviewed about an hours worth of vids (bearden, hutchinson effect) and they are interesting and suggestive, but not one shred of information, circuit diagram, machine, magnet configuration, that would allow anyone to test their assertions. i am not giving up, i am building a tesla bifilar coil experiment now, with positive results, but find no help from the references yet.
<|endoftext|>The Philadelphia Experiment is a fascinating one. I personally think it's unlikely, but I'd love to hear what /r/conspiracy thinks about it! 
<|endoftext|>I've been researching history and ancient technology for about a year and this is by far the most applicable and understandable resource I have ever found. I highly recommend this report to everyone, it covers ancient symbology, technology, tesla and it's connections to today's society's such as the freemasons: 
<|endoftext|>Something else to throw into this discussion, which I haven't had the time to research properly yet, is the idea that the two navy destroyers which crashed in the Pacific might have been attacked by some form of advanced tech which disabled their electronics. There's been speculation that it wasn't operator error or a computer based hack, but an actual energy weapon of some sort. Russia has claimed to have used such a device against the destroyer USS David Cook in the Black Sea, as well. Official US sources and most US media have denied these claims, but it's still worth investigating. 
<|endoftext|>[electric universe geology]( the Missoula Floods were recent and they were plasma
<|endoftext|>Just about every technology developed by humans has a weaponized branch, and this goes back to pre-history. (Rock can be used to crack nuts, or rock can be just as good at cracking skulls.)I'd think that if there's some type of technology that does mass-energy conversion better than anything the public is currently aware of, there's going to be some effort to keep wraps on it. It was bad enough that nukes proliferated back in the 1950's, and I suspect the PTB in charge of western countries don't want a repeat.So even though it'd be great for most of us if we had electric cars with indefinite range using a new power source, if the same tech could be used to make a "pocket nuke" and not need the usual hard to get or traceable materials, then we're unlikely to ever see it.So if it's possible for stuff like this to exist, then I'd say there likely is some effort to keep it hidden or painting it as so fringe that it'd dissuade most scientists from going near it, lest they get blacklisted or lose credibility among peers.
<|endoftext|>The only solid proof you need of the suppression of humanitarian/useful technology is big oil suppressing the most important technology to our race at this moment, which could save the planet and most of its species from destruction within the next 100 years or so. See: Trump- "Climate change is a hoax"

<|endoftext|>[Nikola Tesla. Why did Tesla say that 3,6,9 was the key to the universe?](
<|endoftext|>I have to say I'm skeptical of a lot of the claims about Tesla made here, but I'm willing to have my mind changed. So a couple questions for those who think he discovered/invented things that have been suppressed: * What are the specific Tesla technologies you think have been suppressed?* What evidence do you have that these technologies are feasible (other than the fact that the government confiscated his research)?* Why has no one (outside of government) been able to reproduce any of these technologies in the 75 years since his death, or have they?Specific sources would be much appreciated.

<|endoftext|>Here is some excerpts from Tesla and what he thought of the current Theories of his time. More or less against them entirely.
<|endoftext|>What I don't understand is why there are so many newspaper articles about Nikola Tesla but no footage. He lived until 1943 so there is no good reason why such footage should not have been captured.Does this lend weight to the [theory]( that Tesla was not who we were told he was? 
<|endoftext|>Part 3 is interresting. [This]( guy is being mentioned. 
<|endoftext|>I'm a little off-topic here but I've thought for a long time now that smart phones were brought about for the demise of the internet, or to put it more bluntly, the dumbing down of content on the internet. I've been a computer/internet guy for decades, before it was everywhere. For those of you who were plugged in during the early days you'll probably agree that in order to be a part of the web community, you needed a) to be reasonably smart with computers, modems, ISP's, and internet navigation in general, and b) have a fair bit of financial dedication to it. Not everyone could, or knew how to access and use the net so it was *generally* a place of *reasonable* intellect once you arrived there. Even the stupid shit online had a element of wit about it. Then came the smartphone, timed perfectly with Facebook, and suddenly any dickhead with a $0 upfront contract had immediate access to the internet in their pocket with the press of a single button. Suddenly the internet became a place of true stupidity.Most of what I read now on the net isn't sourced, isn't fact, and has 3000 comments from complete morons who all think they all know shit. No one is correcting anyone anymore (like the old days when unforgiving, vicious fact-checkers would verbally bash you until you plug-pulled and cried yourself to sleep), and the great, retarded circlejerk has begun. Look at any news post on Facebook now and scroll the comments. It's just 1000 toothless dickheads spewing unchecked retardation with 1000 more applauding them. The same happens for any news site that all encourage user comments now. This is the internet now. So why? Maybe the original internet community was getting a little too smart, or had too much potential? Maybe we were splitting from the pack becoming too innovative? I don't know, but it wouldn't be the first time in history where pockets of collective intellect were attacked, infiltrated, and/or disbanded. But by flooding the net with the entire population I think it dumbed us all right down and trivialised the entire space. Spelling in general is appalling, grammar is fucked, content is dribble, and ideas... well, what ideas? No longer is the net a place of *reasonable* sense and intellect, but it's truly owned by fucking morons now, breeding more morons with each additional comment and each additional user. Just a thought.

<|endoftext|> the EM theory taught in schools today is based on a truncated version of Maxwell's original equation setI've been looking at Electro Magnetic theory recently and there is at least one massive hole in it. Everywhere says to ignore magnetism in calculations for simplicity and the theory still works.Furthermore interaction between a so called electro*magnetic* field and magnetic fields doesn't appear to exist.  The closest anyone has got to affecting light with magnetism was to change the circular polarization slightly, and that requires a medium, it doesn't work in air and wouldn't work in a vacuum suggesting it's the medium causing the effect and not the magnetic field. Short version: Light is supposed to be an electromagnetic wave but passes through a vacuum (electricity can't do this) and isn't affected by magnetic fields.

<|endoftext|>Reading the post you made, following this link  stumbled upon an excerpt which was rather alarming to me:Firstly:OPERATORS, ELECTRONICS TECHNICIANS, MILITARY PERSONNELAND THE LIKE. THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCEBETWEEN SOVIET AND U.S. OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS. BOTHCOUNTRIES CONTINUOUSLY REEXAMINE THEIR SCIENTIFICBASIS. THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY STANDARD IS 10MILLIWATTS PER SQUARE CENTIMETER (10,000 MICROWATTS).IT IS BASED ON MINIMIZING THE HEAT STRESS PLACED ON THEBODY BY EXPOSURE LEVELS ABOVE 10 MILLIWATTS PER SQUARECENTIMETER.Then:THE SOVIET OCCUPATIONAL STANDARD IS 1,000 TIMES LOWER,10 MICROWATTS PER SQUARE CENTIMETER FOR A WORKING DAY.IN SETTING STANDARDS THE SOVIETS HAVE TAKEN AN APPROACHWHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH SCIENTISTS OFTHE UNITED STATES OR WESTERN EUROPE BELIEVE IS JUSTIFIEDBY EITHER SCIENTIFIC DATA OR **EXPERIENCE**.My interpretation of this, is that US Scientists have the freedom to set the level of *acceptable exposure* to anything they wish, based on experience? Would that be a possible explanation for such a discrepancy detailed between the varying levels of US and Soviet acceptable exposure?To play devil's advocate; Can anyone think of possible (TPTB) motivation for the US acceptable exposure to be so much higher?
<|endoftext|>So I just was reading though [this patent]( on the spacecraft. I have an issue with this line: Moreover, in our dimension, the speed of light is 299792458 meters per second. Hyperspace energy has a speed of light equal to one meter per secondI find this very unlikely that the hyperspace speed of light is one meter per second. The meter and second are arbitrary measures created by humans. I suppose it could be on the order of 1 m/s but that is still a pretty huge coincidence. Maybe this guys is just "blowing smoke":From experiments with the magnetic vortex wormhole generator, it is known that the proper combination of electromagnetic fields, together with this negative energy, can create a wormhole through which smoke can be blown into hyperspace. 
<|endoftext|>I, too was wondering about the John Quincy St. Clair patents. Looking through historical St. Clairs I found some significant names on the list: especially Jean de Saint-Clair, alleged sixth Grand Master of the Priory of SionWikipedia claims the Priory of Sion was a hoax fraternal society... that it was allegedly founded on Mt. Zion in the kingdom of Jerusalem  and all sorts of obviously made up legends about it. I wonder what the truth of it is?This site discusses how he claims to have communicated with pleiadians  . Sounds like a bunch of BS to me. Certainly seems like an intelligence operation. However, it could be a way of seeding concepts into society. I'm not sure if any of them are viable though. Its interesting because these types of patents are typically banned by the patent office ( which was brought out in some recent FOIA documents which I made [a post about](
<|endoftext|>Tellinger did a couple vids about the ancient structures in Africa that emanate a different reading in electro magnetism. Ideas from this type of research would relate to Where the ancients placed their structures. He and quite a few others call these areas points on a World Grid. At these points energy constantly enters our system: like the elephant in the zero point room is 'How did ancient man use these areas?' [Ancient Structures]( on Ancient Africa]( I think is going on is we are missing a piece. If we could ascertain all of the points in the world energy enters the system, then we just need a proper mechanism to harness, transmit, amplify, etc, that energy. The pyramids for instance would be what this device was placed in. It's probably really simple too.But something like this, it's called a zero point antenna. Or a beginning of its concept:[Zero point antenna](
<|endoftext|>Leedskalnin just used car batteries hooked up in parallel to power saws that struck the limestone with a regular period, generating resonance and allowing the saw to vibrate sympathetically with the dtone, allowing it to cur through in a matter of hours. "Levitation" was achieved with tripod gantries, moving each leg slightly up at a time as a very large three-legged lever.Real ingenious use of harmonics and simple machines, it was explained really well. Wish I saved the video it was so interesting, look up coral castle explained maybe? 
<|endoftext|>From what i have read, the original goal was invisibility; surrounding a ship with devices that emitted electro magnetic pulses. The ship was rendered invisible, but it also was spotted at another port miles away before it rematerialized. Crew members who wore metallic devices (watches) suffered worse effects, with the metal burning and sticking to them. Some people were stuck halfway into floors/walls, had mental issues, and sometimes would spontaneously burst into flames at a later date. Some theorize tesla's work was involved, others say Einstein was in on it... could be both. 
<|endoftext|>As far as I understand things, the experiment was real, but the teleportation stuff never happened. That tale reads more like a pasta than any actual account.

<|endoftext|>It is excellent to see other people who are also skeptical of the claims made about Tesla. What I have noticed on this sub and elsewhere is that if you even dare question the many stories and myths surrounding Tesla, a lot of people seem to get triggered by it, no different to challenging Jesus in a church.It seems to me that anybody who sees [this short video]( and is truly open-minded i.e. willing to challenge their own beliefs, will feel inclined to begin looking for evidence to support those beliefs. This is real skepticism.

<|endoftext|>Here is the linked quora thread in all of its greatnessTesla opposed relativity theory and quantum mechanics, and was arguing for the aether theory. He made several unsupported claims that he discovered effects which violate SR. But then, he didn't even accept the fact that atoms are mutable and consist of smaller particles and believed electrons are physically impossible...From The New York Sun (July 10, 1935):He found time while surveying his own past to express his sharp disagreement with the theories of Prof. Albert Einstein. He announced that the theory of relativity is "a mass of error and deceptive ideas and opposed to common sense," and that "not a single one of the relativity propositions has been proved."From The New York Times (July 11, 1935):He described relativity as "a beggar, wrapped in purple, whom ignorant people took for a king." In support of his statement he cited a number of experiments he had conducted, he said, as far back as 1896 on the cosmic ray. He has measured cosmic ray velocities from Antarus, he said, which he found to be fifty times greater than the speed of light, thus demolishing, he contended, one of the basic pillars of the structure of relativity, according to which there can be no speed greater than that of light.From New York Herald Tribune (September 11, 1932)I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.Some quite bizarre thoughts from Popular Science (November 1928), on electrons and radioactivity, showing remarkable misunderstanding of some already widely accepted at that time theories:"To account for its apparently small mass, science conceives the electron as a hollow sphere, a sort of bubble," Tesla says. "Now, a bubble can exist in such a medium as a gas or liquid because its internal pressure is not altered by deformation. But if, as supposed, the internal pressure of an electron is due to the repulsion of electric masses, the slightest conceivable deformation must result in the destruction of the bubble!"Just to mention another improbability, the force tending to tear an electron apart is, in pounds per square inch, represented by the staggering figure of 256,899 followed by twenty-one zeros - and this is 513,798,000,000,000,000,000 times greater than the tension that tungsten wire can withstand? And yet it does not burst! Not even when it is hurled against an obstacle with a speed hundreds of thousands times greater than that of a bullet!And  more widely interesting in this day of radio  this strange, many-sided man clings to the opinion he expressed in his scientific investigations published from 1896-1898, that the source of all rays we know is always a stream of tangible particles or corpuscles, rather than waves or vibrations. Even before the discovery of radium, Tesla expressed his belief that radioactive rays were of this sort, a view ridiculed at that time. When radium was discovered it was found actually to emit particles of matter  flying nuclei of helium atoms, called alpha rays. Tesla has maintained ever since that radium is not a generator but a transformer of energy, the emanations being caused by cosmic rays of immense power capable of penetrating all obstacles however thick.And more strange thoughts from Galveston Daily News (March 13, 1932):"As I revolve in my mind the thoughts in answer to your question I find the most wonderful thing is the utter aberration of the scientific mind during the last twenty-five years. In that time the relativity theory, the electron theory, the quantum theory, the theory of radioactivity and others have been worked out and developed to an amazing degree. And yet probably not less than 90 per cent of what is thought today to be demonstrable scientific truth is nothing but unrealizable dreams."What is 'thought' in relativity, for example, is not science, but some kind of metaphysics based on abstract mathematical principles and conceptions which will be forever incomprehensible to beings like ourselves whose whole knowledge is derived from a three-dimensional world."The idea of the atom being formed of electrons and protons which go whirling round each other like a miniature sun and planets is an invention of the imagination, he said, and has no relation to the real nature of matter."Perhaps no other has given rise to so many erroneous ideas and chimerical hopes. Everybody speaks of electrons as something entirely definite and real. Still, the fact is that nobody has isolated it and nobody has measured its charge. Nor does anybody know what it really is."In order to explain the observed phenomena, atomic structures have been imagined, none of which can possibly exist. But the worst illusion to which modern thought has led is the idea of 'indeterminacy.' To make this clear, I may remark that heretofore we have in positive science assumed that every effect is the result of a preceding cause."As far as I am concerned, I can say that after years of concentrated thought and investigation there is no truth in nature of which I would be more fully convinced. But the new theories of 'indeterminacy' state this is not true, then an effect cannot be predicted in advance."If two planets collide at certain time and certain place, this is to the student of positive science an inevitable result of preceding interactions between the bodies; and if our knowledge would be adequate, we would be able to foretell the event accurately."But in the spirit of the new theories this would simply be an accident. 'Indeterminacy' introduces into the world of inert matter a principle which might virtually be compared with the universal illusion of free will."Of course, there is no such thing. In years of experimenting I have found that every thought I conceive, every act I perform, is the result of external impressions on my senses.87.8k Views  
<|endoftext|>Film footage was not all that widespread in Tesla's day. And consider the events of the time, WWW 1&2, the Great Depression, alcohol prohibition, mass strikes and boy-cots, is it truly all that surprising that we don't have film footage of Tesla? And this doesn't even mention the slanderous pr campaign leveled against him by Edison.No, don't read too much into there not being footage of him. Cameras and film were nearly as ubiquitous as they are now. ;)
<|endoftext|>If Apple and other cell phone manufacturers now have "permission" from the "PTB" to release the smartphone tech, why do they still make large desktops and laptops that require active cooling, rather than implement this tech into those devices as well? It's because the cell phone tech isn't all that special when you look at the hardware.For starters, the resolution of modern phones is significantly lower than the resolution of a desktop monitor, so right off the bat less processing power is going to be required to display images. This was even more true when the first smartphones were being released - the first ones had abysmal resolutions. Next you have to consider how smartphones are used. Even today, as far as I know, "true" multitasking isn't available on most smartphones, meaning you can't have even just two apps open side by side at the same time. The marketing for multitasking is deceiving - sure the phone can cache app data so that you can open it more quickly next time you use that app, and phones make the app easier to reopen using some nice menus - but it's still not multitasking in the desktop sense of the word. Having only one program open and using processing power at a time makes for much less strain on the CPU, meaning less powerful processors that give off less heat are required. Add in some serious slimming down of the OS because phones don't need all the bells and whistles that windows and mac do, and you start to see how it's all possible. Additionally some manufacturers (Apple) control both the hardware and software of their phones, allowing them to optimize their software for their specific hardware. It's the same reason game consoles have comparable graphics (PCMR don't shoot me pls) to PC's - when you can optimize your software for the hardware it's running on, you can make much better use of the hardware. The explosion of smartphones in the late 2000s was not due to some crazy technological revolution, in reality it was just progress as usual. The *adoption* by consumers was the real revolution. Smartphones for power-users such as PDA's, Blackberries, etc had existed since the late 90s, nearly a decade before they were being adopted by normal consumers. And those smartphones that started to get really popular in the late 2000s? They *sucked*. Have you tried using one recently? I had an iPhone 3G up until 3-4 years ago (so until about 4 years after its initial release), and it was incredibly slow. Multiple seconds to even open apps after clicking them, stuttering when typing, slow to load webpages, etc. Those early phones didn't "come out of nowhere", they just sucked slightly less than previous iterations.
<|endoftext|>SSD technology had a lot to do with this. Smartphones no longer have any mechanical parts, all of it is done electronically.  The fact they have made so much advancement in NVRAM technology is mostly to do with this. Also you have to remember you mobile processor and laptop/desktop processor are very different, the mobile produces much less heat than the desktop, but has some limitations.
<|endoftext|>A few years ago? If you mean a decade plus then maybe I'd agree with you, but a few years ago I was watching youtube and playing games at the same time . . .
<|endoftext|> I've been a computer/internet guy for decades, before it was everywhere. For those of you who were plugged in during the early days you'll probably agree that in order to be a part of the web community, you needed a) to be reasonably smart with computers, modems, ISP's, and internet navigation in general, and b) have a fair bit of financial dedication to it. Not everyone could, or knew how to access and use the net so it was generally a place of reasonable intellect once you arrived there. Even the stupid shit online had a element of wit about it.Meh, sorta. Even if you weren't tech savvy, by '93 or so anyone at a school computer lab was able to connect in. Libraries followed soon after; I remember when I was poor and traveling I could always just go to the library to surf(although then it was alt.binaries.pictures.stuff and message boards.And the smartphone was inevitable with the current technology. You had all these people with pagers, then cell phones, then motorola and blackberry were competing to combine the two, and you had verizon's little flip phones with a GUI. Once you had a phone/camera/radio/texting pager the addition of more and more features was bound to be an arms race.People who get their news from social media sites(here included) don't deserve to be called morons, as long as that's not their only source of news. I used Fark for aeons before Reddit, Yahoo news before Fark, Netscape news before Yahoo, and dial-in BBS sites back in the day. It's easy to just live in a bubble and reinforce your own cognitive bias, but it leads to outcomes like the 2016 election. Once it gets thrown in your face hard enough how insulated you are from the facts, you have to wake up a little. Spend a little time on r/facepalm to see people posting BS on Facebook get theirs. Subscribe to r/askhistorians or other strongly curated spaces for as close to unbiased truth as you can get.I think this is a great time to be informed. You can research who owns the site you're reading, find out everyone's research methodology and the politics of their board of directors at the click of a mouse. I think most of the people yo're upset at are just kids. They'll figure it out eventually. We did.
<|endoftext|>My mum, a then forty-something housewife, was active on he internet in the late 90s. She's not *particularly* tech savvy. She wasn't then, she isn't now. She's not an idiot by any means, she knows what she's doing on a computer but she isn't *great* with tech stuff. Anyway, point I'm trying to get to: people who weren't super intelligent and/or super focused on tech were on the internet *decades* before smartphones became ubiquitous. I think your who idea doesn't really make sense at all. 
<|endoftext|>Huh?? How could Einstein have been a distraction? That is like saying Newton was spreading false information. While no scientist can ever be 100% each discovery brings us closer to our understanding of the universe and everything around it.
<|endoftext|>Wow, I profoundly disagree. I guess Copernicus, Newton and even relatively advanced early civilisations like the Mayans were all just distractions and misleads? Science is a work in progress, not an absolute truth (even though truth is its ultimate, unreachable goal). Einstein did a mighty fine job of advancing human kind a significant amount on this scientific journey, especially when it comes to practical application of his theory (good luck posting on Reddit/using a computer without hundreds if not thousands of different applications of his theories). After a while, as humankind's pooled knowledge grows and new discoveries are made, his theories too will be refined, retuned and perhaps even completely rethought. This is, as I explained, the nature of science. I just wish he would have been alive to experience modern quantum mechanics, no doubt in my mind he would've had some pretty rad insights :) 
<|endoftext|>I never took university level physics, but this theory as you describe it is not accurate. A moving magnetic field produces an electric current which produces a magnetic field. And that magnetic field can interact wih the electric current again. I got this understanding from a video on electromotors I watched. The experimenter was demonstrating how certain kinds of geometry can be used to minimize the electromagnetic resistance and vastly increase the efficiency of generators.
<|endoftext|>How is electricity unable to pass through a vacuum?How is an electromagnetic wave different from a magnetic field?
<|endoftext|>But omens are shared in the same manner, however those can't be demonstrated. The difference here is that we can finally prove that people own and use this technology to remotely harm others, and if Russians have it, who the fuck else and what are they doing with it?
<|endoftext|>It's an interesting interpretation, acceptable exposure discrepancy. However we have to dismiss symptoms/temporal illnesses and harassment stories (with testimonies extremely similar to Cuban diplomats), the issue that it was the only embassy with abnormal exposure levels (after dept. of state sent detectors to other embassies) and the use of aluminium shielding in the embassy.Discrepancy about safety levels are one thing, but I'm not sure what could be the alternative to the symptoms and harassment.
<|endoftext|>That does seem odd, I think humans perception of TSOL is kind of warped to begin with.Love your username by the way. Always nice to see a fellow student of Ra in the wild.
<|endoftext|>This "world grid" I've heard it referred to as the Christ Consciousness Grid. It is a series of lay lines around the planet with vital intersections at different critical points (Stonehenge, Giza pyramids, Mayan pyramids, and other historical locations that have remained hidden in obscurity). The Grid purportedly enables us to connect to other living creatures through an alternative sense. I've heard it referred to as the reason Multiple Discovery exists. Multiple discovery is when two scientists unknown to each other make a discovery at the same time. The concept is that they feed off of each other's thoughts and ideas that are just "out there" on this grid. They are attuned to the same concept and therefore pick up on each other's thoughts, emotions, and ideas. Incidentally, there is a conspiracy theory that destroying this grid is part of the elites goals. It was part of the reason nuclear "tests" were done for so long in the 50's and 60's. It was also stated that was the true reason they are hell bent on controlling Afghanistan. All of this was shared with me personally from a very credible source. I've dug and cannot find anything regarding this theory on the internet. To be sure there is plenty out there on this grid, but no conversation/sources regarding a conspiracy theory to destroy it. 
<|endoftext|>These structures were obviously meant for something we don't understand, and their placement around the world lining up mathematically is unlikely to be a coincidence. I wonder if our planet is unique for whatever their purpose was, or if every (or any) other planet is the same?
<|endoftext|>Interesting info. I had heard that there was a simple explanation, but still quite clever. Since Egyptians had access to primitive batteries, perhaps this was the way they built the pyramids, as leedskalnin stated. Thanks for the tidbit.
<|endoftext|>Lol those books about Trump and Baron from the 1800s are crazy. My theory is trump just named his son after those books or something. The crazy thing is they also mention a guy named pence
<|endoftext|>And since no one's posted it yet, here's the 4chan thread on it. Very fun read 
<|endoftext|>In 1943, as the technical aide in Division 14 of the NDRC, Trump reviewed and analyzed the papers of Dr. Nikola Tesla when Dr. Tesla died in a New York City hotel. The research was completed on behalf of the Alien property Custodian office in Washington DC. From February 1944 to the end of the war in Europe, Trump was the Director of the BBRL.[7]
<|endoftext|>How?
<|endoftext|>For what I have researched Einstein was nothing more than a distraction from the finding of Tesla. Light is obviously not the fastest speed in the universe. 
<|endoftext|>3 people worked on it.EinsteinTeslaAnd Thomas Townsend BrownThe ship affected, emitted a sort of st elmo's fire around the ship right before it disappeared and reappeared again.U really need to search Thomas Townsend Brown. His daughter did an AMA a long time ago here.
<|endoftext|>I don't think we could explain that with currently held scientific principles. So that is probably why it's been covered up. I dont think anyone is quite sure what exactly happened to that ship.
<|endoftext|>Some later chapters get in to flat earth, personally I disagree with flat earth but I don't think it devalues the other parts of this report which are absolutely amazing, and directly in line with my other research. 
<|endoftext|>I followed along with most of the magnetism stuff, but I also failed to properly understand the significance of that specific symbol. 
<|endoftext|>I think that's the most likely explanation given the evidence I've seen; I was just throwing this out there to see if anyone had any thoughts on this. 
<|endoftext|>Looks like you're right. And it was the USS *Donald* Cook for those interested in searching for it.

<|endoftext|>Some researchers have also noted the connection between the Hutchison Effect and some of the effects observed on 9/11.
<|endoftext|>This is great, but doesn't answer the question about Tesla. Tesla worked with electromagnetism, and zero-point is something else entirely.
<|endoftext|>Scarab is also generally associated with the Moon.'For the Egyptians, Cancer was represented not by a crab, but by a scarab (or dung) beetle, sacred to the Egyptians as a creature of immortality. The beetle is clearly linked to the moons twenty-eight day cycle. It deposits its ball of eggs, rolled in dung in the earth, for the space of twenty-eight days, which is the time it takes for the moon to complete a full revolution through the twelve zodiacal signs. The Egyptians considered the twenty-ninth day to be a day of resurrection, and according to lunar markings, there occurs the baptism of the beetle, when the scarabeus casts his ball into the water, opening to give birth to the young beetle. This immersion and baptism became naturally associated with renewal and regeneration. In this way, the lunar god was always declared to be self-created, never born. This symbolism seems to fit very aptly for the sign of Cancer, so seemingly introverted and self-contained.' - Egyptian cosmology is much different obviously. They weren't ball earthers. So they probably did see many similarities of 'levitation' in the Moon. They didn't believe in relativity or gravity Theories.
<|endoftext|>Thanks for that. I might take a look at his [2-hour podcast]( on the subject if I get the time. I'll have to consider whether it's worth it though, as I already take a skeptical viewpoint to the claims. At this point, I'm more interested in the proponents of the claims showing why they believe them. What I have noticed on this sub and elsewhere is that if you even dare question the many stories and myths surrounding Tesla, a lot of people seem to get triggered by it, no different to challenging Jesus in a church.I'd say it's a broader problem than just Tesla. Among conspiracy theorists in general, there's a certain tendency toward dogmatic thinking, usually of the form "Authority A makes claim X, therefore ~X must be true and anyone who believes X is either duped or paid by A." It's just lazy thinking, IMO, and completely contrary to the type of critical thinking and skepticism necessary to understand our world. 
<|endoftext|>Isn't he sort of right about the electron ? aren't they just probability fields, and not this finite sphere orbiting regularly around the nucleus?
<|endoftext|>Some of his ideas seem to be valid in Newtonian physics, but not quantum physics. I'm disappointed to see him not just wrong, but confidently wrong about physics for which he apparently didn't understand, or even comprehend the mathematics.His predictions for the future would have made for an interesting world, such as broadcast power, but he didn't have the underpinnings to reveal the universe as it is.
<|endoftext|>He was snubbed by the tptb. They wanted to go in the direction of industry and economy . I don't think Tesla was a materialist, so he basically didnt belong in their club.
<|endoftext|> Film footage was not all that widespread in Tesla's day.lol is this a joke? Do you realise that Tesla died in 1943? When exactly do you think film footage began?
<|endoftext|>Thank you. I was going to write this last night, but you did what was likely a more thorough job. It should also be noted that the ARM processors used in smartphones are running on a much more limited instruction set, meaning there's a lot less silicon per core, meaning a lot less energy usage, and therefore less heat generated. Also, you might have a quad- (or even octo-) core processor running at 1.8 GHz in your phone, but you can't really compare that to a modern quad-core i7 running at 2.5 GHz. The larger instruction set of the Intel cores means that it can perform orders of magnitude more FLOPS than the ARM processors, at the cost of orders of magnitude more energy usage and heat output. And in most (all?) quad-core mobile processors, the cores aren't the same. Some are clocked slower (or even different types altogether) to conserve battery life during low-intensity applications, and some are more performance-oriented for high intensity applications like HD video and 3D games. Most phones aren't doing true multitasking either. There's nothing fundamentally different about mobile processors vs. desktop processors; they've just been optimized for different things. There's nothing in their development that can't be explained by incremental progress in transistor size, fab techniques, circuit design, and software improvements. 
<|endoftext|>Ok I have something relevant to your last point.  Of course the iPhone 3 is slow as shit.  -That's apples planned obselence at work.  The updates that you have to install to even connect to the network on one of their dinosaurs will nearly brick them. I'm fairly certain this isn't up to question either <citation needed.  When new products roll out they make updates that basically ruin their old hardware to encourage consumers to buy the new product.  And when the new product runs normal the apple fan believes that their new product is superior.For reference I'm rocking a 2012 android that works fine.
<|endoftext|>My 150 Moto G5 has a 1080p screen (the usual definition of monitors) and can multitask with two apps.Good points overall though 
<|endoftext|>I am speaking of mostly astro physic's. That is the one branch that we can't test our selves. Do you trust the government to give you the information you seek?
<|endoftext|>You get a moment... watch this.  John Hutchinson was a brilliant self described physicist with I believe with no formal training. His story is one of intrigue.
<|endoftext|>I'm no scientist but I wonder if Einstein's theory actually does apply throughout the universe, or if it is specific to Earth.
<|endoftext|>i want to be like him. buy a house with a good size of land then build a laboratory to explore building things like zero point energy devices or perhaps simply a thorium nuclear reactor so i can sustain my house off grid
<|endoftext|>Hey, just read your interaction and I'm curious if you could speak more to his allegation that electromagnetism doesn't seem to interact with magnetism? I'm not sure if I understood him right. But if that is what he meant, I find that incredibly surprising. Like, if you had a super strong magnet, would it bend light? 
<|endoftext|>The Faraday effect is the name of the polarization effect, I recommend reading up on these things, it's very interesting. Youtube too.  
<|endoftext|>Has to do with multiplication. Weird scalar stuff (from what explanations I've seen) generally has a lot to do with waveform properties. And in electronics it's possible to do waveform multiplication.Basically the square root of a negative produces an "imaginary" value. Mostly seen in some math applications with *i*, but there are things to do with electronics or physics where it's also noted with *j*. Theoretically if you do the right interference pattern for the multiplication to take place, and you somehow have an imaginary value input on both - then you can have the product as a negative result. If this applies to something like energy or power output, then there are some hypothesis for some weird results. Things like circuits that show energy loss as cold instead of heat, etc. And those things may break or not be in-line with most accepted physics models.
<|endoftext|>Only if you ignore that in the 60s the US department of state sent microwave detectors to the US embassy in Russia to prove the attack, and they shielded the embassy after that. It's the Cuba issue just a big speaker aiming to the diplomats considering the neurological damage? I think it's not that easy, but we can research more.
<|endoftext|>What the hell, who is this guy? One dude vs the NSA. I wonder what happened with the lawsuit?"NSA operatives can usethis to covertly debilitate subjects by simulating auditory hallucinations, characteristic of paranoid schizophrenia."This is quite interesting to me given that I kept getting these my senior year of college; at the time I suspected I was getting harassed by intelligence operatives but I had no proof. People I told this to thought I was being paranoid. I think its likely that I was getting gangstalked for a few main reasons: 1) I was attending a decently large school; these colleges are known to have agents monitoring and subverting students who go "against the establishment" 2) It didn't start until after I had glimmers of unity consciousness and I awakened to the fact that other's wellbeing is my own. This was after several months of meditating regularly. This of course accompanied a deeper understanding of the power structures that control our society and so I became more vocal about this; posting wikileaks stuff on facebook (which i later realized was being censored). 3) The auditory hallucinations went away after I moved. My experiences make me wonder if they experiment with these sorts of devices on kids at college campuses. Its difficult for me to find evidence of this to corroborate this idea, though.
<|endoftext|>I've heard about that theory the elites want to destroy the energy grid. It was around the time ISIS destroyed that temple in Palmyra I read about it, that they're trying to destroy the grid and anything on that grid that would help amplify the volume(?) of conscious energy like temples and other buildings and artifacts. And that they're doing it through proxies like isis. 
<|endoftext|>Very interesting. Could we apply Multiple Discovery to all the pyramids popping up all over the world at the same time? For the sake of argument let's suppose the Mayan and Egyptian cultures had no direct means of communication , but they both got inspired to create these structures. Where do you think this inspiration would originate?
<|endoftext|> I wonder if our planet is unique for whatever their purpose was, or if every (or any) other planet is the same?We won't be able to figure that out until we give up fighting ourselves and start exploring space. Good question though!
<|endoftext|>Ya, it's pretty funny though. The going meme is that he visited and saw the future and went back to 2016 to fix America, his future knowledge explaining how he was able to actually win the election.
<|endoftext|>Care to provide any evidence to your statement contrary to all of the observations science has ever made pertaining to a universal constant? Quantum entanglement doesn't qualify either, as it is not a measurable phenomenon. We're pretty limited by our instruments, but I'm inclined to agree with you if you can provide some valuable insight. We know so little about the universe it's amazing. 
<|endoftext|> because the story is so outlandish yet fascinating some people can't help but repeat it and embellish it and get everybody all excited by it.
<|endoftext|>Some later chapters get in to flat earth, but there is a lot of great content that holds up whether the earth is flat or round. 
<|endoftext|>I was thinking the same thing. Didn't know what to make of it. I still don't want to take it off the table completely, but I don't want get flat-earthed, either. Thanks for your comment.Edit: [Judy Wood's observations](
<|endoftext|>Celine, you have just won yourself a new fan. I can only hope that your skeptical attitude rubs off on more people on this sub. There is lots of potential here, but too many people who have no apparent understanding of what skepticism is all about.
<|endoftext|>Yes, a magnetic field. In 1925 physicists began talking about the spin of the electron. Shortly afterward they started looking at the spin of the Components of the nucleus itself. The spin isn't the orbital motion of an electron around a nucleus, but actually more of a measurement of the electrons magnetic field.Probability field might be a better way to describe it. Because within this field is what I think is The Impression we pattern into it. So this field would be linked to our thoughts and emotions and basically linked to the blueprint of our perception.
<|endoftext|> Isn't he sort of right about the electron ? aren't they just probability fields, and not this finite sphere orbiting regularly around the nucleus?Geez, he was *this close* to inventing the [Improbability Drive^^^TM]( !
<|endoftext|>Electron*s* plural, yes, but not Electron, singular. There's only one of them, you know. That's why zero point energy is possible; you're just tapping into it. It's funny, but what he called "aether", was really the same thing as "Electron", or at least is ubiquitous in the same way. 
<|endoftext|>basically, his ultimate dream was to provide free power to everyone in a period where businessmen found out how profitable selling electricity was
<|endoftext|>Do you think they had a film camera on every street corner? You know that at the time of Tesla's death most people didn't own a tv and saw the bulk of film in Theaters?Why do you think this is about when film *started*? It's about how wide-spread that tech was in the early 1900's and it wasn't as ubiquitous as it is now. People now take the availability of video for granted.
<|endoftext|>Yea for sure, I have no doubt there is some of that going on, but it has always been pretty slow. Like I said in another comment, the most objective proof against the argument above is the FLOPS of different devices, which never lie. Check that comment for a comparison of a newish phone to old game consoles; new phones still get blown out of the water when looking at raw processing speed. There was never some secret injection of technology to make a rapid advance in smartphones, just incremental upgrades.
<|endoftext|>Late to the party, but I enjoyed your post. As a fellow Android user, I assume that you need to keep the phone hooked up to a USB cord constantly, as the battery life goes to shit after a couple of years.
<|endoftext|>Alright, my bad. Recent phones (within the past 2-3 years) are starting to get much higher resolutions because of incremental improvements to hardware. What I should have said is that the earlier smartphones that appeared around the mid to late 2000s had very poor resolutions compared to desktops.This doesn't really "prove" what he's saying because his theory is that there was a large advancement in technology when these smartphones were first being released, not within the past 2-3 years. For more *objective* proof that there hasn't been some crazy advance in smartphone technology, check my comment below with the link to FLOPS for different devices. 
<|endoftext|>It does as far as we can tell. The issue with Einstein's theory is it breaks down completely at the quantum level. Many think because of this it is wrong. Maybe, I don't know, I just know what they hope for is a universal law that can be applied to all things big or small.
<|endoftext|>What I know: electric current creates a magnetic field that spins at right angles to the electron flow. Moving a magnet creates an electric current at right angles to the motion of the magnet. A generator that runs off of moving magnets will create an electric current that generates a magentic field that - IF the design is not careful - will oppose the motion of the magnets (field of the magnet interacts with magnetic field of the electric current), thereby reducing the efficiency of the generator.I wish I could find again the video where the guy demonstrated how his design corrects the above problem in a hyperefficient generator.
<|endoftext|>Well, then they are using waves, isn't that relatively common as well? Don't some police departments have access to anti riot technology that use waves to essentially "boil" people on the inside?
<|endoftext|>A desire to communicate may be a common tie to tap into each others thoughts? It could actually be this. It would be the simplest response. Possibly without the disruptions to the grid I outlined the ability to "communicate" may be greater than what we could imagine. Maybe the reason for this fucking device I'm typing on is to further suppress this innate ability, as there is less of a need for biological long term communication. Instead of literally blowing up the grid, they replaced it with a physical communication device versus ethereal. Personally I have a different opinion on why the pyramids evolved all over the world at roughly the same time. I love your idea, and will have to give it more thought. Another simple answer is a similar culture that interacted with both with the intention, possibly, of increasing the effect of the grid. This culture would have either been very mobile, relatively mobile and highly displaced, or an unknown ancient sophisticated culture. So obviously ET for very mobile. I think however we have vastly underestimated the ability of these ancient cultures to navigate the globe. They had a very keen understanding of astronomy and were obviously industrious. Displaced would be Atlantians or the like. Ancient sophisticated culture is least probable. If our "highly sophisticated" culture collapsed overnight we would be hunter/gatherers in less than a generation with little desire to construct monoliths. 
<|endoftext|>Hahaah who knows dude all I know is Tesla was doin some crazy shit back in the day, revolutionary shit
<|endoftext|>Space itself can move faster than the speed of light. Space is theorized to be made of dark matter/energy. This is why there is so much research being done into the origin and properties of dark energy and anti-matter.
<|endoftext|>unfortunately not my friend. but the story isn't complete. and our lack of understanding regarding this tech is out of our league. btw this is far as i got
<|endoftext|>Ok. I think most of them are. The Philadelphia experiment proves it in a way. So does many of other phenomenons science can't explain. It must be that the core scientific principles about the creation of reality are wrong, and so that prevents us from understanding these events with our current models. The only explanation I can think of for the Philadelphia experiment is that two dimensions overlapped. But I dont think I could scientifically explain a dimension of reality, and how more than one could overlap.I could do it metaphysically Somewhat. With a touch of science fiction.. Somehow they initiated some sort of portal through the veil during the Experiment. Entered this portal briefly, went to a somewhat parallel Earth, or even into another time frame of the Earth they were in. But do to lack of understanding they didn't return properly. They returned off center. They should have returned and be overlayed directly over the exact same space they had left. But there was something that interfered. They were in a state similar to how we think a rainbow is. A reflection off water. In that type of state, and the people watching started freaking out and pushing buttons and actually interrupted it, and that caused the refocus to not be a seamless one.
<|endoftext|>Right you are, my mistake. It does indeed go into flat earth in the end. I'll give it a read nonetheless. Like you mention it does address a lot of good content. 
<|endoftext|>Thank you, and the feeling is mutual. I think it'd be interesting to poll this community to see how they got into conspiracy theories in the first place. I imagine for many, it was 9/11. The thing with that is, a lot of the early 9/11 conspiracy videos (I'm thinking Loose Change, specifically) made a lot of leaps in logic and tried to pin the event on certain players rather than make a thorough accounting of what we actually know. From "there are glaring inconsistencies in the 9/11 Commission Report," it does not necessarily follow that "Bush did it," or "Mossad did it," or "CIA did it." The official narrative is not our story, and we don't need to prove what really happened. We just need to point to official story and say "this, this, and this make no sense." The burden of proof is on them, and they have failed to meet it. That is a much stronger indictment of the official narrative than any of the various alternative theories. That's not to say we should not try to piece together what might have happened and who might have been involved, but I don't think we gain anything or persuade the fence-sitters by saying "this is what happened and this is who did it," if we don't have a rock solid case to back it up. Not sure how I got on the 9/11 tangent, but my more general point is that we're unlikely to arrive at truth by selectively picking the facts and patterns that fit a narrative that *we want to be true*. Even if we accidentally stumble on the truth in this manner, we won't be able to demonstrate it to others, and certainly not to critical thinkers. I think I was getting at the idea that many people's introduction to conspiracy was through the idea of learning a new "truth" to replace an old "truth" they used to believe. They never went through that often tedious process of looking at the arguments for a position, trying to find any inconsistencies or fallacies in the logic, and then doing the same for the alternate positions. They just accepted an answer that for one reason or another appealed to them more than their old answer. It was more emotional than rational. And if they never developed the skill of skeptical analysis afterwards, all they want to do is *be given* more answers that they like better. I'm reminded of the Gore Vidal quote: "I'm not a conspiracy theorist  I'm a conspiracy analyst." The difference might seem minute to some, yet I think it captures exactly what we're trying to get at here. We should be striving to analyze all the facts and data we can get our hands on rather than try to project on them a theory that in some way makes us feel better about ourselves or our world. 
<|endoftext|>i'm a huge fan of Nikola, but how can SR & QM be revised w/ what he's saying here?SR & QM are fairly well proven at this point, so I'm wondering what alteration would be needed to incorporate what he's claiming here.
<|endoftext|>is aether the energy present in a vacuum? My only understanding of this is from Krauss with the experiment of to panes of material in a vacuum still have some interaction between the panes.
<|endoftext|> Electrons plural, yes, but not Electron, singular. There's only one of them, you know.Have I wandered into some Steampunk fantasy subreddit? Do you have any evidence of this claim, subscribed to any reputable physicists?
<|endoftext|>Check out [this]( link comparing processing power in FLOPS of different devices. Even a recent phone (Galaxy S6) has significantly less processing power than last-gen consoles (that were released 10 years before the S6 was!). Care to explain what was reckless about the dismissal? You're providing anecdotal evidence about "desktop wars" and saying that computers were struggling to play HD videos in the mid late 2000s (???) and that somehow shows that smartphones are secret government tech? I fail to see how my response and the comment above are a reckless dismissal when they provide a rational, data-based rebuttal. 
<|endoftext|>Well, they actually made arguments, not something you bothered to do in your dismissal. It's astonishing to me how many people complain about and smear other users who dare to question their narrative, as if refusing to swallow information without examining it were something that is antithetical to conspiracy theorizing. In actually, it is the bedrock heart of it. If you aren't rigorously examining and even trying to disprove your own theories, in all likely you are someone else's tool. 
<|endoftext|>And this is a lackluster rebuttal. The original iPhone had nowhere near the processing power of even budget laptops of the day, in terms of FLOPS or any other benchmark. They didn't even have 640p screens until the iPhone 4 in 2010, and didn't have full 1080 until the iPhone 6+. I still have an old 2009 iMac with 3 GHz Core 2 Duo which runs 1080p flawlessly. No phone from that time even had a 1080 screen, let alone the processing power to run it. The latest Snapdragon 835s are certainly catching up with the i7s at this point, but it's been incremental progress the whole way. The 835 can even run Windows 10 at this point, and I suspect we'll see a move toward ARM processors into low and midrange laptops in the coming years. If your theory is correct and you have more than anecdotal evidence, show us where the government-released tech was injected into the market. Show us when ARM processors somehow got a huge jump in performance or reduction in energy usage that can't be explained by incremental progress. 
<|endoftext|>I guess embracing anything written here solely because it contradicts whatever is mainstream is the way to go?The guys presented solid arguments (in contrast with what you offered) and were subject-literate when doing so (again, in contrast with yourself).Maybe it is indeed time to move on.
<|endoftext|>I would've if this thing were actually in commission all those years. I've only had it a year and my friends dad had it for 6mo before it hit thrown in a closet and forgotten until my last one broke.
<|endoftext|>You asked about long accepted scientific concepts. I'm not your science teacher. When you read up on these things you might come to the same conclusion I did. Or not.
<|endoftext|>Yes but these were used for covert harassment, that's the big difference. These weapons you are talking about, that were used in Iraq, operate in a frequency that it's expected to heat the skin, not the insides, but that's not the limit of the directed energy attacks, as the same principle (with different wavelength) can be used to cause actual internal- organ damage. If you are a strong dissenter or political dissident and suddenly you are remotely harassed in your own home, how are you going to prove this? Are your health issues enough to state that you are being remotely harassed with directed energy weapons? We know this case because the targets were diplomats, but we might be ignoring how countries that aren't very human rights friendly can use them. Maybe the suicide by bullet in the back of the head or suicide by polonium and other techniques not limited to hostile countries (who knows if the US does them too), might get a lot easier to perpetrate against enemies or annoyances. We need to bring this vulnerability to the table and push for regulations, shielding and detectors.
<|endoftext|>Yea. I view our technology to be a reflection of what we do as a consciousness. More akin to what we do subjectively, or with our latent psychic abilities and subjective senses. And yes the reason they are latent is because Materialists have basically ruled the world for a while. They have made everything about materialism, even our spirituality. But The web itself is just a reflection of the interconnection in the collective consciousness, right? When you drop it's materialism what is it?We could as a whole drop all the devices we use and then turn our perception inside out. By using our inner senses to do the same thing we use the web for. Or the phones... Phones are telepathy. The t.v. is a thought coupled with imagination. All things that send and receive data show how consciousness is a web of interlinked energy across a worldwide energy grid.So you could say Technology is showing us the nature of our own consciousness.
<|endoftext|>Ah, this seems a good enough place to drop this word picture: a somewhat parallel Earth, or even into another time frame of the Earth they were inIf we consider time in itself as a true dimension such as the 3-d of space, we can think of "sideways" time, when "straight" time, which aligns unidirectionally from past to future, is seen as a layer of simultaneous times separated from each other by contingency (that is, the many possible actions that could have been taken in this world but were not).We actually use this expanded time dimensionality quite commonly in ordinary speech and thought. We say "The British might have defeated the Colonists and the USA would not now exist." If that contingency (the American Revolution was stopped) had both been a real possibility, and then had actually happened, then there would at present be a "parallel world" in which we would have a very different political history (assuming "we" is meaningful, since perhaps "we" would never have been born). However, if we think only of the contingency of the most recent presidential election (had Clinton not Trump won), then the alternative "time frame" would be very similar to the present reality, just with us talking about different political events than the ones we actually are.Science since the Greeks has been pretty strong on the unreality of contingencies. Our linguistic structures are well-adapted to orient conversations as to whether what we are saying has happened, could have happened, is happening, will happen, or might happen. The very definition of science is based on throwing the statements about "could have happened" or "might happen" out the window.The exception of course is the science of statistics and probability, which deals with contingency directly. Like the weather, a flipped coin, a rolled dice, or any other randomly generated number cannot be predicted, because we cannot measure the multitude of influences that will cause the result. Like an atom discharging a subatomic particle to kill a Schroedenger's Cat, only the ability to measure any contingent result is sufficient for science to admit its reality. Hugh Everett's multi-universe interpretation of quantum-scale randomness is the suggestion that two parallel universes are created when the cat either dies or lives. The Philadelphia Experiment somehow transported into such a parallel universe, and barely made it back.One more comment: most people miss the implications of living inside an infinitely infinite swarm of possible universes, both at the largest (infinity of universes), the smallest (infinity of particulate structures) and personal (infinity of life-stories).
<|endoftext|>Perhaps the rotation of the earth meant that the ship returned to the same spot, but the duration of time meant it appeared to have moved.
<|endoftext|>so this could be the "vibrational energy" i heard a lot of people talk about. Even Thomas Townsend Brown used pulsated frequencies to propel or "lift" his device. I can only deduce that if thomas had something to do with that experiment they were using his skills in electrogravitics to test the ship out.
<|endoftext|>Of course. Instead of looking to science I researched channeled materials for info about how reality is created. In the 60's Jane Roberts started channeling Seth. Seth explained many aspects of creation, and dictated many books. In them he touches upon what he termed CU's,or Consciousness Units. So I will take an excerpt from the web to show you the angle he approaches it from:Seth: "Now: there are electromagnetic structures, so to speak, that are presently beyond your (scientific) instruments, units that are the basic carriers of perception. They have a very brief life in your terms. Their size varies.Several units may combine, for example; many units may combine. To put this as simply as possible, it is not so much that they move through space, as that they use space to move through. There is a difference.[Note: This may seem complicated at first, but once we see that what Seth calls space is in fact the aetheric energy, it makes sense. Since the units are made of aetheric energy, they must use aetheric energy to travel. They are not self-contained particles that move through an empty vacuum.] "In a manner of speaking, thermal qualities are involved, and also laws of attraction and repulsion. The units charge the air through which they pass, and draw to them other units.The units are not stationary in the way that, say, a cell is stationary within the body. Even a cell only appears stationary. These units have no home. They are built up in response to emotional intensity.They are one form that emotional energy takes. They follow their own rules of attraction and repulsion. As a magnet, you see, will attract with its filaments, so these units attract their own kind and form patterns, which then appear to you as perception.[Note: This is easy to miss. Seth is saying that everything we perceive is some form of pattern built up from consciousness units. Since they do form all of physical matter, this is a very accurate statement indeed.] "Now: the fetus utilizes these units. [Note: Seth had been discussing the fetus earlier in the discussion.] So does any consciousness, including that of a plant.Cells are not just responsive to light because this is the order of things, but because an emotional desire to perceive light is present.[Note: This idea of an emotional desire to perceive light conforms with cutting-edge research cited by Gregg Braden in his various books. The work of Garaiev and Poponin entitled the DNA Phantom Effect has found that a DNA molecule can be inserted in a cylinder with light passing through it, and the DNA will actually attract the light and cause it to spiral through the molecule!Furthermore, when the DNA is removed, the light continues to spiral as if the DNA were still there. (We will have a lot more to say about this in Volume III, as it relates to evolution and how the torsion wave forms the DNA molecule.)This is obviously a very strange finding, but we can see that Seth helps us to understand it; the DNA has an emotional desire to perceive light, as it naturally attracts light into itself. This might not seem possible until we realize that all life and matter has some degree of consciousness, since it is made of intelligent energy.] "The desire appears on this other level in the form of these electromagnetic units, which then cause a light sensitivity.These units are freewheeling. They can be used in normal perception or what you call extrasensory perception. I will discuss their basic nature at a later session, and I would like to tie this in with the fetus, since the fetus is highly involved with perceptive mechanisms.("Next session will be fine.")It is not that you cannot devise instruments to perceive these units.Your scientists are simply asking the wrong questions, and do not think in terms of such freewheeling structures.[Note: Seth implies that we can indeed design instruments that would be able to perceive these units.We will have a lot to say about this in Volume III, as there are several Russian scientists who have designed very effective torsion-field detectors. Also, this work has been replicated by Lt. Col. Tom Bearden (ret.) among others in the US.The pyramid work of Joe Parr, also covered in Volume III, clearly shows these fields as well. So, the latest research shows that since the time when Seth gave these readings in 1969, some scientists are now asking the "right questions."]
<|endoftext|>"Proven"?Let's start with quantum *statistics* (mechanics is a bit too far.) Just because the math helps us with predictions doesn't mean the philosophy behind it is right. The way I see it, statistics is the admittance that we *dont* have all the of information about nature.Continuing with special relativity, it's about the furthest thing from proven. We have no clue whether time is actually slowing or the idea that matter moving through aether affects it. If aether has some weight to it (it can, depending on the model chosen to analyze) than I would expect matter moving through it to perhaps affect it. As for length contraction, and mass increase as velocity approaches the speed of light. I actually think this is really just enforced through book keeping, not observed. What did your research show?
<|endoftext|>As we learn more about our solar system, galaxy, and universe, we begin to realize that an Einstein universe is less and less a true and COMPLETE understanding.Whats more, I am starting to believe that Teslas theories were proved correct, most likely in his lifetime, and covered up by the government hence the reason for the FBI classifying his harmless research. Theres more to that, but Im still working on it.Just been looking at the facts compared to the propaganda weve been subjected to and the lies become obvious.Ive looked at alternative theories out there. Ive even looked at present day aether theories....they arent quite a complete picture either, so Im still looking for answers. 
<|endoftext|>haha you're not gonna like it if you immediately appeal to authority, but yeah. And now you have to go seek it out yourself because you're a dick :P
<|endoftext|>I already know it. You're talking complete bullshit and I want you to explain it.Electricity can't go through a vacuum? How do you think satellites communicate with earth? The aether?
<|endoftext|>It possibly did, or at least the concept. The problem with calling it aether by Nikola's time is it was a word already associated with mumbo-jumbo and any talks of such a thing had scientists laughed out of the community.In current times, dark energy is a proven thing which is once again being widely studied. Except we no longer call it aether even though it has superfluid like properties. While technically right, I think it is a problem in translation as the classical definition refers to aether as a medium.
<|endoftext|>Tesla could be wrong, but when such a genius straight up denies other mainstream theories, the least we can do is look into it. Question everything! Lol
<|endoftext|>Quantum entanglement moves faster than light. Negative matter. The most credible way of sending signals faster than light is via negative matter. It has been proven, mathematically. The way of breaking the light barrier may be through GR, General Relativity, and the moving/bending of space time. Though only in theory and one can not prove that NM, or negative matter, exists. This is one of the ways matter can exceed the speed of light.
<|endoftext|>Love the idea of sideways time. Totally connects to channeled info i like where it describes accessing other dimensions of consciousness as 'stepping sideways'Here is one example:
<|endoftext|>Very interesting. I've always been a fan of these kind of ideas, although admittedly very skeptical, but this is all new to me so thanks for the study material!
<|endoftext|>This is a really buddhist way of looking at things and dictates more control to the observer than the observed. I like the ideology, and am curious about how it stacks up against what we currently may and may not know.
<|endoftext|> Consciousness UnitsVery nice, good troll.Unless you're just fucking nuts.Show a single reproducible effect of this nonsense. No? Didn't think so.
<|endoftext|> As for length contraction, and mass increase as velocity approaches the speed of light.When I first learned about *c*, my first question was "How do we really know, besides through math, that an object nearing the speed of light will have 'near infinite' math," and it seems like one of those questions man invented that cannot be answered through any known means and may take a long time to resolve a more thorough and definitive answer. It seems like the mass claim may be more of a distortion based on the amount of energy it would take to move a body at that speed destabilizing the structure of the object itself, like an explosion without combustion.What were the findings with mass when smashing atoms together in an LHC?
<|endoftext|> And now you have to go seek it out yourself because you're a dickYou have nothing but a tinfoil hat. Thought so. I didn't subscribe to anything - I asked if you have anything in your hand besides your dick.Dick.
<|endoftext|> Electricity can't go through a vacuum? How do you think satellites communicate with earth? The aether?You think satellites send data to the earth through electricity?  o_OAnyway the point is, vacuum is not conductive. You can make it conductive under extreme conditions, but according to EM theory it happens spontaneously in straight lines through millions of miles.  Or between a candle flame and a forest floor, whatevs!
<|endoftext|>My pleasure, I personally love the ideas. And I do view reality as created by myself in this way. Through emotional intensity and pattern. Exploring the mechanical aspect of it is all conceptual, meaning you are using an inner sense to actually form the understanding in consciousness so that you can then sense it. Every thing every moment of our lives is this process. We send an energy outward from ourselves and consciousness forms around it.Our interaction in this way was brought on by your emotional intensity and mine together. It had never existed before, We brought it into creation through this process that Seth describes. 
<|endoftext|>Actually you just showed it with your emotional intensity. All the various units attract to it to create your 'outburst.' Everything you do shows how these units form around your energy. But they are not 'units' in the strictest sense of the word. They are more like fields.
<|endoftext|>I applaud your critical thinking. It's spot on. The interpretation of the increasing difficulty in adding momentum to objects as their velocity increases can be interpreted in a few ways. Religious prone human scientists, many whom reverse Einstein, have chosen a (helpful) *model* and ran with it, yelling within the confines of their echo chamber that nonsensical things are happening, and that we juts have to accept the unintuitive nature of these nonsensical things. Something quite similar seems to be happening with quantum statistics.It's actually kind of funny when you think about. It's plausible, unlikely, and in the face of other models (aether dragging is up there) we should be quite critical of the zealots who (incorrectly) profess they **know** what's happening. What were the findings with mass when smashing atoms together in an LHC?I'm a logical and critical thinker whose taken high level engineering and modern physics courses but the science of high speed collisions is something I'm not well training enough to say anything with certainty. On the face of it, I don't think it's possible to measure the mass of a moving object unless that 'scale' (many types exist) is also moving in that reference frame. And when it's in that reference frame...oh, relativity conveniently (for it's non purposeful predictions of measurement) suggests that there is no mass increase!  (Theory being that the mass increase is for an object in a reference frame with different velocity / acceleration.)See, we can use light to try to obtain measurements from these moving objects, but we're dealing with a shadow of reality when we are only going by the 'photon' emission. We don't even have much an idea what light really is. By definition we can't see it in the lab / with a microscope. It's (part of) *how* we 'see' anything at all. The idea that light is a ripple in aether rather than a ripple (more technically oscillator) of nothing but itself; a self propagating wave. Another quite illogical supposition when you really step back and think about it. To wrap this up, I'll add that one solution to the frictionless seeming nature of the photon through the supposed aether would be that the photon literally picks up energy from this aether. Some would call this the 'zero point energy'.---P.S: I wish the dude above would answer. Probably ran back to his echo chamber
<|endoftext|>Actually, we have ways of observing things like time dilation very precisely, with for example unstable atoms. You know that the half life of that thing is like 20ms, but if you accelerate it very quickly now it looks like several seconds to you, which is a very strong indication that time dilation represents accurately what happens at high speeds. It's been checked so many time with GPS satellites too, but those don't get near infinite like in particle accelerators.
<|endoftext|>They send it through an EM wave which excites electrons in an antenna and causes current flow.Electricity is the movement of charge carriers which operate using the electromagnetic force.Either you're saying electrons and their associated fields can't move through space (false) or electromagnetic fields can't move through space (false).When you boil it down, people mean "transfer of electrical energy" when they mean electricity in which case you can use either definition in common speech.The action of the fields is basically what we think of as electricity. 
<|endoftext|>I think it is a grounded theory. Yet, it is still theory. I do believe that it is a snip bit of truth. It wouldn't be as main as it has been for 80 years if it were not something used as a partial truth and distraction.
<|endoftext|>Nothing that you typed makes any rational sense. You are a loony. You're all shorts and sparks upstairs. You're so far off, you're not even wrong.What happened is that I saw your ridiculous post, and chose to send you a little chastisement for being nuts.
<|endoftext|>Ok you understand the commonly accepted basics, I am only looking at accepted theory and testing it. Let's take an example. The light from the sun is an EM wave.  It is composed of a sequence of collapsing *magnetic* and *electical* fields. Look for actual empirical science examples (i.e repeatable experiments) of light interacting with either *magnetic* or *electrical* fields.  There should be LOTS. I've only so far found the faraday effect and it only works in a medium, and then only weakly (maybe it's the medium?).

<|endoftext|>I think you're confused. I didn't see a reference to the CIA FOIA, or a link to a study. Are you really criticizing my ridicule of the post that started out;Instead of looking to science I researched channeled materials for info about how reality is created. In the 60's Jane Roberts started channeling Seth.There's nothing credible there - he even said he's abandoned science. If you're giving this any of your time, you're wasting it. Instead of this bullshit, how about a basic physics book? I recommend Brian Greene. Or a history of Europe. Either of those would be better than reading nonsense about cells "emotionally wanting to perceive light".I can't stress this enough - if you credit that shit, you're wasting your life.
<|endoftext|>You're wasting your time reading nonsense without the skills of critical thinking. Garbage is still garbage.

Remember that you researched 1984 and *literally* wrote me a book report?It's not that this nonsense bothers me more than other nonsense - you jumped in by making unwarranted judgments about me, then you couldn't let it go when I started criticizing your weak approach to the world. That's the reason you convinced yourself that I'm the one with the problem.That's some pretty strong self-deception you have going.

<|endoftext|>To say nothing of US state policies and practices prior to WW2, it's almost like our keepers learned of Nazi and Imperial Japanese human experimentation and occult/phenomena research and said "well hey that's a great idea." And soon thereafter "well hey the Soviets are doing it to too, we gotta keep up." I've done my digging and been disgusted by what I've found. As this may be the most confirmable and devious 20th century conspiracy by the US government against it's people (in the usual guise of being conducted "for" the people), it's still quite relevant. I have some questions for those more knowledgeable than I. Were systems like this already in play in the US long before WW2? Aside from Eugenics I mean, though it's clearly a precursor of sorts. I've read pieces on E.T. disclosure in which former state officials coming forward to claim and hint-hint about Roswell and other events are viewed with extreme skepticism...largely around how much should we really be trusting former state officials to tell us the truth about anything? Are we being misled on purpose? Too good to be true? Branching off of that idea, were the official end of the program and the release of declassified docs a "too good to be true" kind of thing? Perhaps that out of concern for the public finding out about the program the state then disclosed part of it, punished some of it's players, thereby informing the public of what occurred but also indirectly insuring us that it no longer continues. Many sources I've seen claim that it was a small, niche program only known to a few select agencies and players...was this really the case, or simply an attempt to reduce the public scope the program itself?Is there any doubt that MKULTRA-style interrogation techniques aren't still being tested and perhaps utilized at CIA black sites?

<|endoftext|>Relevance to the topic:I support this suggestion. However I'm more interested on discussing the modern devices and artifacts used for a effective brainwashing. Lets be coherent, these days it's difficult to provide LSD or other substances and perform a psychological "montage" like MKULTRA did to disrupt the victim, but technologies like military V2K (exploiting the microwave auditory effect: voices in ones mind) and other remote directed energy weapons designed to harm (ultra/infra sonic and microwaves) can disrupt a victim to the point of making a remote (re)programming possible, even guiding a harmless person to commit one or more "convenient" crimes.**CIA unethical non-consensual human experimentation:**In August 1951, inhabitants of the picturesque French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit were suddenly tormented by terrifying hallucinations. People imagined lions and tigers were coming to eat them. A man jumped out of a window thinking he was a dragonfly. At least seven people died, dozens were taken to the local asylum in strait jackets and hundreds were affected.Almost immediately, wild theories started circulating to explain the this mysterious case of mass insanity. There were claims of poisoned flour, contaminated water and even witchcraft. But the truth was stranger than many of the theories: the CIA had spiked the local food with LSD as part of a mind control experiment at the height of the Cold War.In this documentary, we reveal how for decades, the CIA has been using unconsenting people as guinea pigs in thousands of different experiments.Link to documentary Army toyed with telepathic ray gun** NONLETHAL WEAPONS COULD TARGET BRAIN, MIMIC SCHIZOPHRENIA** Declassified: Bioeffects of selected non-lethal weapons:** investigators have been searching for a device that may have caused the "sonic harassment," but an ongoing investigation hasn't revealed the culprit.

<|endoftext|>Has there ever been any material declassified or leaked about the Soviet or Chinese equivalents of MKULTRA and the wider patronage of 60s counterculture by the CIA? Considering how much more "blatant" their totalitarian regimes during the era were it seems surprising that neither of those two countries ever made any attempt to engineer a new type of culture for the latter half of the 20th century. Which is strange considering they both had access to more or less the same resources as the US on that front and that they *did* compete with the US in much more resource-intensive fields of R&D like nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Counterculture, helped the US gain enormous influence over non-aligned nations and left communism fighting an uphill hearts-and-minds battle around the globe. Why didn't the communists attempt to artificially manipulate their culture and reinvent themselves into something that would be more popular? Or did they do that and it just didn't work? Closest that I know of is the Maoist cultural revolution and destalinization but those were both blunt political initiatives carried out in public.
<|endoftext|>This article is about the actress Celia Imrie's experiences of MKULTRA. I remember reading this when published in 2011, and finding it truly bizarre that she was disclosing this information.
<|endoftext|>Recommended reading in regards to MKUltra (or just the government in general) experimenting on children:  "highlights":From early **1940 to 1953, Dr. Lauretta Bender, a highly respected child neuropsychiatrist practicing at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, experimented extensively with electroshock therapy on children who had been diagnosed with "autistic schizophrenia." In all, it has been reported that Bender administered electroconvulsive therapy to at least 100 children ranging in age from three years old to 12 years, with some reports indicating the total may be twice that number. One source reports that, inclusive of Bender's work, electroconvulsive treatment was used on more than 500 children at Bellevue Hospital from 1942 to 1956**, and then at Creedmoor State Hospital Children's Service from 1956 to 1969. Bender was a confident and dogmatic woman, who bristled at criticism, oftentimes refused to acknowledge reality even when it stood starkly before her.**One six-year-old boy, after being shocked several times, went from being a shy, withdrawn child to acting increasingly aggressive and violent. Another child, a seven-year-old girl, following five electroshock sessions had become nearly catatonic.**Years later, **another of Bender's young patients who became overly aggressive after about 20 treatments, now grown, was convicted in court as a "multiple murderer."** (*before the word "serial killer" existed.. almost makes you think they were created* OP's thoughts) Others, in adulthood, reportedly were in and of trouble and prison for a battery of petty and violent crimes. **A 1954 scientific study of about 50 of Bender's young electroshock patients, conducted by two psychologists, found that nearly all were worse off after the "therapy" and that some had become suicidal after treatment.** One of the children studied in 1954 was the son of well-known writer Jacqueline Susann, author of the bestselling novel "Valley of the Dolls." Susann's son, Guy, was diagnosed with autism shortly after birth and, when he was three years old, Dr. Bender convinced Susann and her husband that Guy could be successfully treated with electroshock therapy. Guy returned home from Bender's care a nearly lifeless child. Susann later told people that Bender had "destroyed" her son. About the same time Dr. Bender was conducting her electroshock experiments, **she was also widely experimenting on autistic and schizophrenic children with what she termed other "treatment endeavors." These included use of a wide array of psycho-pharmaceutical agents**, several provided to her by the Sandoz Chemical Co. in Basel, Switzerland, as well as Metrazol, sub-shock insulin therapy, amphetamines and anticonvulsants... **a public mental facility, reveal that Metrazol was administered to them by CIA contractor Dr. Robert Hyde on numerous occasions in order "to address overly aggressive behavior."**In 1955 and1956, **Dr. Bender began hearing glowing accounts about the potential of LSD for producing remarkable results in children suffering mental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Bender's earlier work with electroshock therapy had brought her into contact with several other prominent physicians who, at the time, were covert contractors with the CIA's MK/ULTRA and Artichoke projects. **There is sooo much more, including this chilling personal story:"During the 10 sessions, each of which involved an injection, my sister and I were kept in separate bedrooms, darkened rooms, usually with someone present in the room, but I don't know who the person was. Occasionally, my mother was also present. At times, I was so frightened by the hallucinations that I screamed and tried to escape from the room. I remember once actually reaching the hallway and being forcibly put back into the bedroom by my mother. I saw a wild array of images - nightmarish visions, occasionally provoking hysterical laughter, followed immediately by wracking sobs. I had no idea what was happening to me. It was terrifying...."Although each individual session was often terrifying, any lasting effects of the LSD unfolded gradually. In the weeks immediately following the final session, I experienced frequent nightmares - visions of crawling insects, horrible masks, etc. I couldn't sleep. I was afraid to shut my eyes. I became afraid of the dark. My parents were dismissive and unsympathetic. Their attitude was, in some ways, more disturbing to me than the experiments themselves because it meant that my parents had known full well that the experience would very likely be frightening - and hadn't cared."Two years after these experiments, during her freshman year in college, my sister suffered a nervous breakdown. I don't know the extent to which the LSD may have precipitated this. But my parents' response to what was probably a mild breakdown from which my sister could have recovered, was coercive and drastic. She had been asking questions about the LSD at this time. She was angry about it. We both were. We talked about it together, but I was afraid to confront our parents. My sister was not. The angrier she became, the more she was 'diagnosed' as a 'psychiatric' case and the more medication she was given. To this day, my sister is heavily medicated. She never fully recovered from that first episode."Our parents responded to my sister's anger in a way that frightened me further. I also felt tremendous guilt for not being able to prevent the horrors that my sister endured. Once she was 'classified' as a psychiatric patient, she was lost. Everything that was done to her in the name of 'treatment' seemed to me to be a form of ongoing abuse and torture."**The fact that our father was a prominent, internationally known and widely respected physician - and his brother, who had introduced us to this LSD horror, was a prominent, internationally known and widely respected psychiatrist - made it impossible to expose them or go against them. Their reputations were more important to them than the health and well being of my sister.**"Even when I subsequently confronted my father with the evidence that LSD had been tested by the CIA for use as a military weapon in the 1950s and 1960s, he dismissed his participation by saying that it was an 'enlightening experience, like visiting an art gallery.' When I pointed out that this was not my experience as a child, he dismissed it, including the presumption that I must be a 'conspiracy theorist' to propose such a thing. At the age of 91, he finally admitted that it had perhaps not been a very good idea to subject my sister and me to LSD. experiments where Ambramson and then Dr Bender begins dosing children with LSD: In 1960, Abramson conducted his own LSD experiments **on a group of six children ranging in age from five to 14 years of age. **Her initial **group of young subjects consisted of 14 children diagnosed schizophrenic, all under the age of 11.** (Because diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, autism, and other disorders have changed over the decades, one cannot assess what actual conditions these children really had.) There were 11 boys and three girls, ranging in age from six to ten years old.Jean Marie is **almost seven years old.** She came here nearly a year ago after her parents abandoned her to the care of an aunt who had no interest in raising her. Marie, who prefers to be called Jean, is shy, withdrawn, and distrustful of most adults she encounters. There are reports she may have been sexually molested by her uncle ... Despite her withdrawn nature she smiles easily, and enjoys the company of other children. After receiving LSD on three occasions earlier this month, **Marie ceased smiling at all and lost any interest in others her age** ... In the past week, she seems to have become easily agitated and has lost any interest in reading, something she seemed to very much enjoy before treatment.

Children were held in cages and murdered in satanic ritual abuse procedures as part of terrorizing the survivors. Trauma based mind crreated sexual slaves used to ensnare powerful people on film with babies and children if a citizen did this we would use the penalty. 
<|endoftext|>MK Ultra is old news guys. Much bigger and farther reaching programs now that is undetectable to a vast majority of the population.
<|endoftext|>I'm not saying everyone is doing this here but quite often I see people demonizing LSD when they bring up MKULTRA or claim that the entire counterculture movement of the 60s was because of MKULTRA which I think are two positions that obviously disingenuous to anyone who has actually done LSD, at least more than once or twice. Although they very well may have contributed to the culture of the 60s and introduced LSD to a lot of people who then introduced it to others I think if you look into historically you find that most of the people experimenting with LSD in the 50s were psychologists who bought LSD straight from Sandoz and then they introduced it to friends. Rick Doblin highlights this cultural movement among psychologists and psychiatrists in his many interviews and the fact they were doing this research at Universities and involving grad students creates the perfect atmosphere for a cultural spread of psychedelic culture that was the 1960s. Obviously such powerful substances as LSD can be used to torture individuals or possibly induce psychic phenomena such as shared hallucinations but I keep seeing people blame MKULTRA when actresses in Hollywood have a breakdown or even attribute Marxism to LSD which I think is illogical and disingenuous. Most people have enlightening experiences when they try psychedelics and most psychedelic enthusiasts tend to be in support of individual freedom above all else. That's not to say that people havent lost their minds on LSD or it cant cause delusions and there is evidence that at least a few serial killers and murderers were part of the MKULTRA program including the infamous "uni bomber."

<|endoftext|>[The Empire Files]( did a good 30 minute piece on the human tests conducted by the US military on it's own troops since WW2. The MK Ultra program pretty much shaped the way the military conducts experiments on unsuspecting US soldiers to this day.
<|endoftext|>Here's a link to a 2015 film called "CIA Covert Experiments."  In 1951 the CIA sprayed a French village with LSD to test LSD as a combat weapon on the battlefield. Quote: "It is August 1951 and an entire French village goes crazy. People are screaming in the streets and throwing themselves out of windows. 300 people are affected and 7 end up dead. 60 years later declassified documents from the United States reveal that the CIA conducted experiments on unsuspecting citizens." Folks can watch the film for free with a free 30-day trial if they're not an Amazon Prime member.
<|endoftext|>MKULTRA wasn't about manchurian candidates, it was about social engineering. The entirety of the 1960s counterculture was engineered by the CIA. 
<|endoftext|>I think the most telling, modern day example for the continuation of MKUltra experiments was the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting.  suspect apparently went into an FBI office in Alaska and complained about hearing voices in his head telling him to watch ISIS recruitment videos.

<|endoftext|> Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron (24 December 1901  8 September 1967)  was a Scottish-born psychiatrist who served as President of the American Psychiatric Association (19521953), Canadian Psychiatric Association (1958-1959), American Psychopathological Association (1963), Society of Biological Psychiatry (1965) and World Psychiatric Association (1961-1966). Notwithstanding his high professional reputation, he has been criticized for administering electroshock therapy and experimental drugs to patients without their informed consent. Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra mind control program.
<|endoftext|>Kind of random, but I don't know where to put this. Anyway, I just want to say that this really is one of the best moderated subs I've seen, especially for such a contraversial topic. Seriously, I haven't seen anyone banned just for disagreeing with a conspiracy, which is honestly not what I expected when I first came here. It's much more interesting to read about these things when you can see the counterarguments, instead of just a string of deleted comments. Even though I don't really believe in most of these, I'm still a lot more persuaded than I would otherwise be. Anyway, just thanks to the mod team for being cool.

<|endoftext|>Mind control is spiritually based in that demons are instilled into a person during trauma and then called forth to take over that person's consciousness and make them perform as required. In the Bible, in Acts 16, the apostles encounter a woman whom we could say fits this description. "And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: the same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour." (Acts 16:16-18) Although the demon in this case gave the skill of divination, demons have been rumored to give other skills, for example: musical instrument performance, physical strength, telepathy, remote viewing, intelligence, foreign language fluency, and "photographic memory". When reading about famous people, many will speak multiple languages at a young age or have photographic memories. Robert Johnson was just one of a great many musicians rumored to have sold his soul for musical talent. Svali, who claimed to be an Illuminati defector, said that her fluency in multiple languages stopped when she placed faith in God's only son, Jesus Christ. The classic story of Faust is about selling one's soul for intelligence and knowledge - Gnosticism in a nutshell. What better way to create "super soldiers" than with demonic assistance? Finally, another rumored skill granted by demons is the power of persuasion. There is documentation of governments using hypnosis to obtain information from enemies during the Cold War. Cult leaders such as Marion Pettie, Jim Jones, and L Ron Hubbard, were associated with the intelligence community.
<|endoftext|>I think that so far at this point... and with the advance technology the Government has... we all are part of the MKUltra programming. In Fact, i think we are being programmed while we watch Game Of Thrones, The Superbowl, The Primetime news, Radial waves that our smart TVs, PCs and Smartphones transmit throughtout the air ... Subliminal Imagery and Sounds our unconsicious mind can easily catch without us ever knowing about it... Sound notes and words that trigger a certain emotion and reaction in our central-nervous-system. Certain ingredients mixed up in our cans of Pepsi or in our starbucks coffee. Classified components that not even Doctors are aware of... Chemicals that come from the mixing of plants and artificial substances made inside the ClA labs back in the 50's... Lots of money, wealth and power is put into this by the Elites of the world (Bilderberg Group)... and the only clue we have to it... it's the one left into the 90's card game "Illuminati", someone who was inside the Elite or somehow got this information put it all away in a children's card game that nobody even ever played... with the hopes (or maybe because he felt sad about us) that we can have a little.... very very little... glimpse at our true reality. Just a tiny glimpse, a foolish and inmature glimps at our existance.

"jojo's pizza".also, it's not the first time that hillary and bill clinton or their close friends the podesta brothers have been tied to child prostitution rings and sex offenders.
<|endoftext|>I'm more interested in the mind experiments being conducted now. Too bad you have to be an insider to know about them.
<|endoftext|>The entire Evidence Of Revision series is amazing. Jonestown was certainly a mkultra experiment.Many people forget how close Jim Jones was with politicians. In fact, he was appointed chairman of San Francisco Housing Authority, where he recruited many of his future victims. From  of his notable honors was being selected chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission by San Francisco Mayor George Moscone (Layton, 105). The Mayor was one of his greatest supporters, even sponsoring a Testimonial Dinner in the reverends honor (Layton, 105). On one occasion, Jones hosted a celebration for Martin Luther King Jr. s Birthday and shared the podium with Governor Brown and the Chief of President Carters Transition Team (Layton, 105). When Ronald Reagan was the governor of California, he sent the Temple a thank-you note to the Temple for all of their hard work in the community (Layton, 35). His most noteworthy advocates include President Carters wife, civil rights leader Angela Davis, Pastor Cecil Williams, and Indian rights activist Dennis Banks (Layton, 65). With such an entourage, it is easy to see why Jones had success Despite his outlandish doctrine and often erratic behavior.*
<|endoftext|>[The Men who Stare at Goats]( a full audiobook, but the last chapter is over MKULTRA death of Frank Olson. 
<|endoftext|>I just watched another link off of this link; Donnie Marshall. Have you watched it holy shit bone chilling. Some of the names in it are truly shocking and really makes me even more skeptical of ANYBODY in mainstream and anybody who dies to early. Shit is fucked up.
<|endoftext|>My reaction is exactly the same. We might be at the same level of research, I'm not sure, so consider these for thought rather than as authoritative, they're all "as far as I know."Truman created the what is now the CIA in 1947. The agency is the secret police at the will of the president. I believe that it works the other way around as well, in the Deep State uses CIA to find and use blackmail techniques specifically against the president. Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves. Let me repeat that because it blows my mind that this is not the only thing we talk and DO something about: Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves. CIA must have known about ancient ritualistic torture techniques to control the human mind. They definitely started the slave program before learning of the "Manchurian Candidate," which they claimed was their motivation.They pardoned the German mind control and the Japanese biowarfare/radiation scientists. The Mengele import was the most obvious and not even acknowledged by the 1996 Presidential Commission that I could see. They could not admit that they were bringing Mengele over so they concocted "German countryside" and "Argentina" b.s. EVEN ISRAEL helped Mengele keep his Canadian and American torture/mind control position of "Dr. Green" ("Green" is the head programmer.) They claimed to have found Mengele but let him go in order not to endanger another NAZI hunt underway, which is the biggest pile of ridiculous nonsense ever uttered.Mengele worked in Canada and bases all over the United States. His work or perhaps his colleague's work I'm not sure (because sometimes I just have to stop reading) was based on ancient and satanic ritual abuse mind control methods which allowed CIA to organize and create mind control recipes.CIA might have been innocent compared to the German and Japanese mind control but my opinion was that they would have done it if they had thought of it, so rather than "that's a great idea let's steal their work after the war," it was "our Deep State masters are multi-generational satanic ritual abuse mind control slave societies already, let's up our game against/with them by using the advanced German and Japanese techniques. I base this belief on the fact that they didn't just steal the "losers'" work. They pardoned, rewarded and protected the criminals from retribution. Today the world thinks Neuremburg took care of the NAZI doctors and doesn't even know about the Japanese cooking people alive.Eugenics - I think you are absolutely right in stating that Eugenics was in place, because Eugenics is a natural precursor to multi generation mind control slavery. I also came to that conclusion. I think Rockfeller Eugenics, NAZI eugencis and Harry Armstrong making sure the NAZI mind control scientists were setup in cushy CIA university jobs are all intimately connected.Re ET in my opinion all ET info is a cover story for two disinfo campaigns. One, ET is used as part of mind control domination, it is a being so powerful that the slave believes he/she is being watched on an atomic level and can therefore not break the terror to escape.Two I think came later but that's just a guess is to use ET as the biggest false flag ever created in order to justify spending trillions to defend earth from the greatest danger it ever faced. William Cooper said that he was leaked ET info in order to disseminate intact but later realized that it was leaked to him so that he would be an unwitting disinformation agent.The documents were not released on purpose. They were stolen and at first the newspapers refused to print them. But they did, hence the Church Committee hearings. Helms ordered all of the MKULTRA documentation burned. The only reason FOIA has anything is because there was a box mis-filed and so handed over (which blows my mind because it would imply there's an honest person complying with FOIA in CIA when we know they accidentally lose Apollo Mission and Torture documentation on a regular basis).Stansfield Turner only exposed and admitted to what was already exposed on stolen paper, which is why LSD and not sex, torture and slavery was exposed. The senators were remarkably kind to him and he was remarkably kind to the universities that received the MKULTRA contracts. They asked him softball questions, and he in turn wrote to universities giving them a heads up that some information on them was public so hint hint wink wink might wanna destroy some records.Most of the FOIA material was financial and so didn't expose the agency to any trouble. NONE of the people involved in LSD or sex slave/assassin/secret courier were sought out or put on trial.No one was brought to trial, no one was punished. Gottlieb wrote a memo he made sure was public saying that CIA had given up on mind control because it didn't work. This was 100% lie. Not only did mind control work, by 1973 the electronic frequency weapons used on people this very day were already well under way. The MKULTRA program is the name I will continue to call it because we are communicating a concept, not being pendantic about secret code words and "it depends on the meaning of 'is.'" Semantics are irrelevant when children are being raped and tortured in order to ensure my freedom as an American. YES it absolutely still goes on today. Targeted Individuals are being microwaved and bombarded with EEG cloning attacks that create forced speech, voices in their brains not produced by soundwaves a recorder can interpret, remote influencing, and mind reading (I am not joking).Its complement is gangstalking, which uses the community to torture, harass and gaslight the victim in order to destabilize what's left of their sanity. The microwave and remote electronic brainwave weaponry is the MKULTRA mind control program, and the gangstalking is part of the victim surveillance and destablization.The MKULTRA weapons mimic psychiatric illnesses of schizophrenia and paranoia. Victims appear to have these disorders because they hear voices. The gangstalking and harassment require sensitization to the perpetrators' clothing or car colors and so to an onlooker there is nothing there when the victim complains of being stalked. But the victim recognizes the patterns and so can't understand why no one else can see them. That is the nature of sensitization. Buy a red car and suddenly you will see red cars all over the place. They were always there but now you're conscious of the color. The weapons induce psychiatric disorders and the gangstalking, harassment, gaslighting and surveillance create valid paranoia. Combined these make the victim appear to someone who knows nothing of these programs as if they are a paranoid schizophrenic delusional person who is therefore completely discredited. Because victims have no credibility, MKULTRA is now a worldwide program of victims being microwaved, having images induced into their minds, having thoghts programmed into their mind, having voices pumped into their cochlear center that interprets noise signals into speech. They are harassed with voices and text messages telling them what they are doing at the very moment they are receiving the message, ensuring they know that the MKULTRA perps have complete control of their lives. The perpetrators say things like "We are going to rape and kill you," and "You should kill yourself."In this way they destroy the victim, they decompose the life force in a modern process of what the E. German government of 1950-1989 called Zersetzung, or "decomposition." EDIT I feel this bears repeating, as this is still going on today:Gottlieb et al created blackmail child pornography films of government and university employees using MKULTRA child sex slaves.
<|endoftext|>Well MKUltra consisted of plenty of Nazi scientists who were brought over thru operation paperclip after the war. To say the least, parts of MKUltra was absolutely inspired by nazi experimental weapons and projects.

<|endoftext|> the release of declassified docsSpeaking from experience, having worked on three DoD classified programs (now declassified), typically, the only reasons any government agency releases declassified documents are:a.) the document's contents is no longer relevant. *b.) the document's contents have been eclipsed by later developments. * A good example of the first one is documentation on early missile tests performed after WW2 which led to further developments in guidance technology. 
<|endoftext|>ET, Roswell, alien spacecraft, they are all red herrings. Probably part of some other program that we dont know about.Ive come to view conspiracies as such.1. If weve heard about it, its probably false.2. If the government has admitted or declassified something they did, but then claim they dont do anymore, they probably are doing it but clamped down on security.3. All government black-sites that we know of are red herrings.

<|endoftext|>I thought it was pretty weird how he met with then president-elect Trump just a few days after experiencing "temporary psychosis" and being in a psych hospital
<|endoftext|>Its worth mentioning that there need not be a 'one single program' that all mind controll is controlled by. Many independent programs, cults, and buisinesses can deploy methods of controll... So if you have a music icon with a lot of people making money off them, it seems plausible that producers may want some controll over these artists as a sort of insurance. So there's that to keep in mind. That said i have very little doubt that programming of this sort is used in the music and media industry.
<|endoftext|> [A Mind for Murder: The Education of the Unabomber and the Origins of Modern Terrorism Alston Chase]( has a lot of dope on Henry Murray, the CIA/Harvard psych who experimented with Ted in the subject set. He doesn't have any drugs or confinement or shock treatments or McGill U extremities. They were more along the lines of Milgram experiments or Stanford Prison experiments. Basically grad students would be assholes to the subjects and study how they reacted. The Harvard students got off pretty light in comparison. Not that they weren't in outrageous violation of modern human experiments protocol, but Kaczynski's twisted psyche was affected by a million other circumstances beyond CIA experimentation. It is chilling in a way how much good sense is contained in the Manifesto. I wonder if the autobiography is ever going to come into print. I would love to read it.
<|endoftext|>This might be the single most important thing you can ever read when trying to answer the "why" behind both ritual abuse and MkUltra
<|endoftext|>Late to the party, I know, but found something weird. This was def a very interesting, albeit confusing read. Decided to look up DC Hammond (the speaker) and he has a website:  seems that he is now focused on neurofeedback. Not a word is mentioned about MPD, ritual abuse or programming. Was kind of expecting more...looks like he just straight up abondened all that stuff? The plot thickens.
<|endoftext|>Can you find another source for the transcript of this talk?A lot of the segues are pretty fantastical and these allegations beget a ton of scrutiny.I've been half tempted to contact the supposed DC Hammond and ask him about this speechI was hoping that link wouldn't show up in this thread.

<|endoftext|>I'm glad there are others following Jan's diatribes. I've probably listened to about 30 hours of his unspun shows. I really love the stuff he does with Dr. Utter; Atwill is also an intellectual force to be reckoned. I worry that a lot of his arguments, however, rely on tenuous connections and fallacious arguments despite his repeated claims of being an expert on the Trivium. When you take the things he's saying in context with the lessons of M. William Cooper in his Mystery Babylon series from the early 90's, they certainly seem to buttress and confirm one another, and yet I've never hear Jan reference Cooper or the majority of his links. Have you (or anyone reading this) used his "brain" software that he provides on his gnosticmedia website? 
<|endoftext|>I've got FOIA-obtained documents on /r/psychotroncis, that prove the CIA was successful in creating mind controlled killers that wouldn't even remember they killed.

No, you cannot magically deprogram yourself over a short time period or with special codes. Your writing is near incomprehensible in places.

<|endoftext|>Yep. Just google "psychotronics". Also of interest is how communist used psychiatrists to undermine the west.
<|endoftext|>I posted these earlier to this thread, but maybe I should have explained better. Back when CNN did actual journalism: [CNN Special Report 1985 Electromagnetic Frequency Technology]( [13:26]It discusses Soviet and American technology. Note, this was in 1985, so the methods have certainly become more powerful and fine tuned. This thread has some Nazi and Japanese experiments, along with Canadian, British, and American: [Conspiracy facts: A brief history of human experimentation without consent.]( that the Japanese were not on our side back then. 
<|endoftext|>This ones new to me! I had no idea that there were any British actors who had spoken out directly about mkultra. I might get my mum to watch Calendar Girls and bring this up in conversation.. she might find it more relatable and close to home. 
<|endoftext|>I think that the lasting effects have to do with what was learned and how it was applied going forward. I wouldn't consider MK Ultra 'old news,' but more like 'square one' of a lot projects.

<|endoftext|>Wow, I wonder what she really said? Their explanation (she just went crazy!) is clearly a cover-up; even uses the same dubbed video, knowing it's fake. 
<|endoftext|>Yes, this even used to be in the wikis on Artichoke and MKUltra, specifically calling Ultra a "limited hangout." All wiki entries on mind control programs and psychotronics have been curiously neutered though- even when citing gov't documents like the .mil paper "The Mind Has No Firewall."
<|endoftext|>Why do you say this? So little seems to be known about the actual chronology of the mind control programs and their relation to one another. I have often thought MKUltra was a limited hangout as well since so much was purposefully hidden. I wonder if the story about the known records only surviving due to mis-categorization are true? If they are then that would mean MKUltra is a limited hang out.
<|endoftext|>StarGate the TV Show? I only ask because my "mentally ill" brother like watching that show and bought many if not all the box sets. It just occurred to me that the tv show stargate had a lot of hypnotic/occultish themes and haven't seen it in like a decade.......

<|endoftext|> Targeted Individuals are being microwaved and bombarded with EEG cloning attacks that create forced speech, voices in their brains not produced by soundwaves a recorder can interpret, remote influencing, and mind reading (I am not joking).Mind reading sounds fantastical until you realise that your little voice in your head (subvocalisation) actually creates movement in the larynx. All you'd need is a powerful camera and a program which can decipher said movements. SVR (Subvocal recognition) is a real phenomenon, being studied around the world right now. It's no secret.

<|endoftext|>In the early 1950's, [Dr. Bernice Eddy]( and [Dr. Sarah Stewart]( discovered [the polyoma virus]( a result, the two were the first to successfully demonstrate that viruses causing cancer could be spread from animal to animal.Tragically, Dr. Eddy's warnings regarding tainted vaccines led to the infamous [Cutter Incident]( which ultimately exposed several thousand children to the live polio virus:In 1954, while the NIH was testing the first commercial polio vaccines, Eddy's job was to test the vaccines from five different companies. Testing the vaccines on 18 monkeys, she and her team discovered that the inactivated vaccine manufactured by Cutter Laboratories contained residual live poliovirus, resulting in the monkeys showing polio-like symptoms and paralysis. Eddy reported her findings to William Workman, head of the Laboratory of Biologics Control, but her findings were never given to the vaccine licensing advisory committee. Although then-NIH director William Sebrell was notified, he chose to ignore Eddy's findings and proceeded to license the Cutter vaccine along with the others. Dr. James Shannon, the associate director of the NIH, managed to get the vaccines recalled.Bernice Eddy also was the first to identify [SV-40]( a cancer causing monkey virus that millions of people were exposed to through contaminated polio vaccines.From the Wikipedia page of [Dr. Herbert Ratner]( 1960 Ratner learned that a government researcher Dr. Bernice Eddy had discovered evidence of a cancer-causing agent that she described as a vacuolating virus in the Salk vaccine rhesus-monkey-kidney culture medium. Dr. Ben Sweet working under Dr. Maurice Hilleman at Merck observed a similar agent in the same kind of medium that they were using to develop a vaccine for adenovirus. The agent was later identified as a monkey virus and named Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Sweet & Hilleman published their work in November 1960 and Eddy published her work in May 1961. The unused box of 1955 Salk polio vaccine Ratner had placed in his refrigerator remained there for more than forty years. In the meantime researchers had begun to discover that SV40 was associated with various cancers. One of these researchers was Dr. Michele Carbone, a molecular pathologist of Italian birth and education, then working at the University of Chicago.Eventually the entire box of remaining vials was given to Carbone in the presence of a lawyer and witnesses. In these vials Carbone discovered two separate strains of SV40, one of which was a slow-growing strain previously not known to have been in polio vaccines and for which the vaccines currently being marketed were not being tested. Moreover, this slow-growing strain was the same as one found in some types of cancerous tumors. Had Ratner not saved vials of vaccine, the source of this slow-growing strain would have been suspected but unproven.So Dr. Eddy not only made two huge discoveries (polyoma virus and SV-40), but she warned the scientific community *twice* about contamination of the polio vaccine and she was ignored twice![From the book The Health Century by Edward Shorter]( Stewart and Bernice Eddy's discovery of the polyoma in 1957 marked the real takeoff of theories about virus and cancer. It could be destructive like polio, but produce tumors at the same time. Although Stewart was later promoted within the cancer institute, she did not in her lifetime win the recognition she deserved. She died of cancer in 1976, Bernice Eddy remaining close to her until the end. "She was a forceful individual who did not let anything stand in the way if she could help it," said Eddy.This is an interesting story, but in terms of drama it's nothing compared to what happens next. At the same time in the late 1950s that Eddy and Stewart were producing cancers in animals with the polyoma virus, Eddy had sneaked back to the polio vaccine. "I did things on the side which I wasn't assigned to do," Eddy said. One of them was starting to conduct safety experiments on the polio vaccine in June 1959, from which she had officially been removed four years earlier. In observing cells from the kidneys of rhesus monkeys under the microscopethe kind of cell preparation from which the polio vaccine was being made by private drug companiesEddy had noted spontaneous degeneration, meaning that the cells would start to die without any apparent cause. She did more experiments with these cells, and on July 6, 1960, reported to her chief Joseph Smadel, that when she injected preparations from those monkey kidneys into hamsters, the hamsters got cancer. Tumors grew in newborn hamsters at the site of injection; probably a virus in the monkey cells was causing the cancer.The story that follows is such a sad one, partly because Smadel himself was a distinguished scientist, not just a petty bureaucrat...he was not pleased, just after assuming his new post in viral research, when Eddy threw this time bomb onto his desk: the possibility of a cancer-causing virus in the polio vaccine. In August he sat down with Eddy, went over her data, and dismissed the findings as "lumps." He thought her rumps unrelated to the degenerative changes (vacuolation) that other scientists had observed in the kidney cells of other monkey species, and he dismissed the possibility that the lumps, might be cancer or cause the disease in humans. He must have been very nasty at the time, for he later wrote to Eddy, "It is my recollection that I was not even diplomatic in telling you that you had no basis for either statement." This was not out of character for Smadel, who was generally known as brusque and authoritarian, although his earlier relations with Eddy while he had been at Walter Reed had been cordial.The Eddy problem landed again on Smadel's desk when, in October of 1960, she gave a talk at the New York meeting of the Cancer Society. At the meeting she described finding a cancer-causing virus in the monkey cells from which the polio vaccine was grown. Thomas Rivers of the March of Dimes Foundation was in the audience and later told Smadel what Eddy had said. Smadel hit the roof. "Smadel called me up," Eddy said, "and if there was anything in the English languageany awful namethat he could call me, he did. Oh, he was mad. I never saw anybody so mad. Smadel wrote Eddy a letter later that day forbidding her to speak in public again without clearing a written text of her remarks specifically with him. That was just the beginning.Eventually, Bernice Eddy lost her labs. In successive measures she was denied permission to attend scholarly conferences, her papers were held up, and finally she was removed from vaccine research altogether. Her treatment became a scandal within the scientific community and was discussed in Senate hearings.
<|endoftext|>The 1918 flu pandemic that killed millions [was partly caused by aspirin overdose]( a 2009 paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, Karen Starko proposed that aspirin poisoning had contributed substantially to the fatalities. She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the post mortem reports still available, and also the timing of the big "death spike" in October 1918 which happened right after the Surgeon General of the United States Army, and the Journal of the American Medical Association both recommended very large doses of 8.031.2 g of aspirin per day. Starko also suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a "perfect storm" of events: Bayer's patent on aspirin expired, so that many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the flu pandemic; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.
<|endoftext|>A weaponized form of Lyme Disease [was created and released]( on Plum Island:Plum Island is 10 miles from Old Lyme, Connecticut and a mile and a half off the North Fork of Long Island.Michael Carroll, an attorney, formerly a law firm associate of the late New York Governor Mario Cuomo, notes in his book [Lab 257] that Lyme disease suddenly surfaced in Old Lyme, Connecticut in 1975 and cites years of experimentation before that with ticks on Plum Island and discusses the possibility of an accidental or purposeful release.Lab 257 documents a Nazi connection to the original establishment by the U.S. Army of an animal disease laboratory on Plum Island. According to the book, Erich Traub, a scientist who worked for the Third Reich doing biological warfare, was the force behind its founding.During World War II, as lab chief of Insel Riemsa secret Nazi biological warfare laboratory on a crescent-shaped island in the Baltic SeaTraub worked directly for Adolph Hitlers second-in-charge, SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler, on live germ trials, relates Lab 257. The mission was to develop biological warfare to be directed against animals in the Soviet Union. This included infecting cattle and reindeer with foot-and-mouth disease. This became the mission, in a Cold War setting, at Plum Island.And, states Lab 257, The tick is the perfect germ vector which is why it has long been fancied as a germ weapon by early biowarriors from Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan to the Soviet Union and the United States.A source who worked on Plum Island in the 1950s, the book says, recalls that animal handlers and a scientist released ticks outdoors on the island. They called him the Nazi scientist, when they came in, in 1951they were inoculating these ticks. Lab 257 goes on: Dr. Traubs World War II handiwork consisted of aerial virus sprays developed on Insel Riems and tested over occupied Russia, and of field work for Heinrich Himmler in Turkey. Indeed, his colleagues conducted bug trials by dropping live beetles from planes. An outdoor tick trial would have been de rigueur for Erich Traub.Traub was brought to the U.S. with the end of the war under Project Paperclip, a program under which Nazi scientists, such as Wernher von Braun, came to America.Traubs detailed explanation of the secret operation on Insel Riems given to officials at Fort Detrick in Maryland, the Armys biological warfare headquarters, and to the CIA, laid the groundwater for Fort Detricks offshore germ warfare animal disease lab on Plum Island. Traub was a founding father, says Lab 257.
<|endoftext|>1916 saw [one of the worst polio outbreaks]( in US history. Originally blamed on "immigrants", a study determined that it was most likely caused by nearby Rockefeller Labs where a deadly "multi-virus" strain of polio was being developed.[More info about polio, including discussion of the 1916 outbreak]( it is a remarkable coincidence that a unique neurotropic strain of poliovirus was developed a few miles from an epidemic caused by a uniquely pathogenic strain of the virus...such an extraordinary epidemic requires an extraordinary explanation.[Here's a very informative video]( on the elusive history of "polio" and the polio vaccine, and [here's the slide show]( Dr. Suzanne Humphries used in her presentation.
<|endoftext|>The [contaminated haemophilia blood products]( tragedy resulted in thousands of haemophiliacs infected with HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970's and 80's.Perhaps the most shocking thing about the episode was that the products *continued* to be sold [even when they were known to be contaminated]( sparked controversy by continuing to sell contaminated factor VIII after new heat-treated versions were available. Under FDA pressure, unheated product was pulled from US markets, but was sold to Asian, Latin American, and some European countries. The product was tainted with HIV, *a concern that had been discussed by Bayer and the FDA.*To me, you can't simply dismiss this as the actions of a greedy company...the intention must be far more nefarious, especially coming from a company like Bayer.
<|endoftext|>The story of [Judyth Vary Baker]( is about as extraordinary as they come. It starts with a book by [Edward Haslam]( called *Dr. Mary's Monkey: How the Unsolved Murder of a Doctor, a Secret Laboratory in New Orleans and Cancer-Causing Monkey Viruses are Linked to Lee Harvey Oswald, the JFK Assassination and Emerging Global Epidemics.*Haslam tells a riveting detective-like tale that spans numerous decades, resulting in the publishing of his first book on the subject, *Mary, Ferrie and the Monkey Virus*. After Judyth went public in 1999, Haslam rewrote the book (as he finally had the witness for his theories that he had been lacking) and released it as *Dr. Mary's Monkey*.Haslam focuses on the macabre and unsolved murder of prominent orthopedic surgeon and cancer researcher [Dr. Mary Stults Sherman]( Sherman's body was discovered in 1964 in her apartment in New Orleans. However, the precise nature of her death wasn't released to the public for over 30 years. It was prematurely concluded that the killing was the work of a "sex-crazed lesbian" who conveniently was never found. Not surprisingly, it was never released to the public that Dr. Sherman's entire arm and right side were missing, exposing her insides. A superficial mattress fire in the apartment was blamed for her severe injuries, even though temperatures of thousands of degrees would be necessary to locally disintegrate flesh and bone while leaving the rest of her body intact. In addition, Dr. Sherman's heart and liver were stabbed, and the heart wound was inflicted while she was still alive. Curiously, her death occurred on the same morning that the Warren Commission first began taking witness testimony.Haslam argues that Dr. Sherman was engaged in a top secret project, ostensibly run by the well-known researcher and surgeon [Alton Ochsner]( and included the young Judyth Baker, David Ferrie, and Lee Harvey Oswald.Dr. Ochsner, who was fiercely anti-Communist, had ties to the CIA, FBI, and even the Mafia, and was part of the very real effort at the time to remove Castro from power, by any means necessary.It's well known that elements of the CIA and Mafia were actively engaged in trying to kill Castro. Their main concern was that a violent death could ultimately be traced to US intelligent agencies, potentially resulting in World War III. Eventually, a more stealthy approach was attempted: perfect a cancer-causing bio-weapon to take out Castro. Although cancer-causing viruses had been discovered a decade earlier, the idea of "inducing" cancer in an individual was still considered by most to be in the realm of science fiction.Dr. Sherman was actively involved with this project, as well as the one of the most enigmatic figures in JFK assassination lore, [David Ferrie]( Ferrie is perhaps most known today as being the first suspect of [Jim Garrison's]( infamous investigation into Kennedy's death.Amazingly, Garrison revealed in an interview with Playboy that he suspected David Ferrie and Dr. Sherman were somehow involved in a secret cancer project, however that little tidbit has largely been forgotten, and it seems even Garrison himself never realized the implications of this connection.In addition to being a defrocked priest and a pilot for the CIA and Carlos Marcello (the Mafia king of New Orleans), Ferrie just happened to be involved with Dr. Mary Sherman, one of the most prestigious female scientists in the country. Ferrie had allegedly developed an interest in cancer research. He filled his apartment with white mice--at one point he had almost 2000, and neighbors complained--and he wrote a medical treatise on the subject and worked with a number of New Orleans doctors on different means of inducing cancer in mice.He also lost all of his hair, and in light of his curious hobbies, this may have been the result of his dabbling with toxic chemicals. He was found dead only days after Garrison first accused him of being connected to the JFK assassination.Eventually the bio-weapon was more or less perfected, and it was subsequently successfully tested on (at least) one inmate at a nearby facility. The subject died in 28 days. However, it seems that their efforts were too little and too late, for the coalescence of interests that wanted to remove Castro from power had completely changed their directive and focused their sights on Kennedy instead. According to Baker, David Ferrie and Dr. Sherman were under the impression that they needed to hurry and created the weapon *before* their superiors got impatient and killed Kennedy instead.Lee Harvey Oswald was supposedly involved with this project, but more in the capacity of running errands and doing some of the dirty work, as he killed and dissected the cancerous tumors on the experimental mice on several occasions.Baker, although very young, had already established herself in the field of cancer research. While still in high school, she had induced cancer in mice faster than any public research being done at the time (one week). She attracted the attention of numerous prominent people, including Dr. Oschner, and she soon found herself being trained at the prestigious Roswell Park Memorial Institute in 1961.Baker and Oswald were hired on the same day at Standard Coffee, and then one week later they both were moved to Reilly. Their jobs at Reilly Coffee were covers for their actual activities. Baker, as the secretary, was responsible for clocking Oswald out to cover up his extended absences, and she still has numerous time cards for Lee with her initial "J" on the front.Anna Lewis, who was married to David Lewis, another well-known figure in JFK assassination lore, is perhaps the last living person who has gone on record saying she saw Judyth and Lee together and that they were lovers. Here is a video of [Anna Lewis]( for when things went wrong, Baker claims that a letter she passionately wrote to Dr. Ochsner doomed her future career in the medical world. She had been extremely upset when she discovered that the "volunteer" the weapon was tested on wasn't a terminally ill inmate as she had been told, but a perfectly healthy young man. Unfortunately for Baker, the letter she wrote to Ochsner ended up in the hands of his secretary, violating the secrecy of the "Project". This infuriated Ochsner and he abruptly terminated his relationship with her.After the project unraveled, Oswald (an intelligence asset) began to suspect he was being set up as a patsy for Kennedy's death, but that he believed himself to be part of a team that was going to try and "prevent" the assassination in Dallas. According to Baker, Oswald stated that his presence in Dallas meant that one less bullet would be fired at Kennedy. She also claims to have met Jack Ruby, who was introduced to her as "Sparky Rubinstein" and she was unaware until decades later that Sparky was the one who killed Oswald. Ruby and Oswald had apparently been friends for years. Oswald's mother had dated numerous Mafia men, including Carlos Marcello's personal driver, so Oswald had ties to the Mafia from a young age. She was also adamant that her son was a government agent and was framed for Kennedy's death.It's even been alleged that Ruby himself called the police station where Oswald would be killed and warned them that an attempt would be made on his life.Ruby's fate, however, was anything but merciful, as he died of cancer shortly after his incarceration. To make matters even more bizarre, Ruby actually claimed to have been injected with cancer while in prison! This was during a time when such a notion was considered ludicrous by the general population, but it fits rather ominously into the narrative of Haslam and Baker.It's possible that Ruby knew of Dr. Sherman's project, and he may have been aware of exactly *how* they induced the cancer: the subject would be submitted to high doses of radiation with an X-ray machine to compromise the immune system, followed by a series of painful shots.Ruby received this X-ray treatment in jail and then was given several shots from a mysterious doctor. When Ruby's cancer was examined after his death, it was observed to be an extremely aggressive form of lung cancer.Dr. Sherman herself likely fell victim to this conspiracy, as Haslam suggests that the secret linear particle accelerator in New Orleans that they were using to irradiate cancer cells was responsible for her extreme injuries. Something clearly went wrong while operating the machine, and she was hastily stabbed, while still alive, and her body moved to her apartment in a sloppy attempt to create a "murder" scene.For more information on Judyth Baker and her story, she is featured in part 8 of the excellent series [The Men Who Killed Kennedy]( Minutes was once set to release a special on Baker, but an order was given to immediately stop production on the segment and it was never completed. According to Haslam, the frustrated 60 Minutes team told him that they had spent more time and money on the story than any in the history of the program.

<|endoftext|>As both a biomedical and public health researcher, I have often tried to find a universal connection behind the prevalence of chronic disease and the health of our mitochondria seems to be the answer.The mitochondria are bacteria that live inside most of our cells and supply most of the energy currency, ATP, through a near motor-like system called Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) along the Electron Transport Chain. Healthy mitochondria elongate, and the surface area of the cristae, folds wherein OXPHOS occurs, increases, promoting more energy potential per mitochondria unit. Similar to cells, mitochondria can divide, move, and former networks in strategic locations near structures that require large amounts of energy.Furthermore, mitochondria are inherited from mothers. Giving a direct genetic line where metabolic disease, disorders, and energetic inefficiency can be inherited. Many pollutants, carcinogens, inflammatory agents, drugs, foods, and more, promote the production of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) and other DAMPs (damage associated molecular pathogens) which can easily cause structural damage to the mitochondria or mitochondrial DNA (it is more susceptible than nuclear DNA because bacteria have limited protection). As these agents increasingly affect a person, the ratio of healthy to unhealthy mitochondria can change, promoting disease states. Furthermore, the mitochondria in your eyes and brain can be completely different than those in your leg muscles or heart, a state called heteroplasmy (nuclear DNA is homoplasmy, same in all cells). Returning to the maternal inheritance: a proposed theory of maternal inheritance is the "mitochondrial bottleneck" wherein RANDOM mitochondria are transferred from mother to egg. So it's a chance game on what mitochondria will transfer to child, however if 50% of your mitochondria are healthy and 50% diseased, the chances of child inheriting disease is more likely.We have all heard of the "beer belly" or the person who just exercises their biceps and triceps but not their calves. What this phenotype comes down to is as the person exercises or drinks the mitochondrial energetic potential in these regions change so the person can support the mechanics of these structures. In the beer belly case though, the mitochondria in the gut organs become diseased and produce scant amounts of energy and cant process the rush of carbohydrates hitting the system, promoting fat deposition. A similar story occurs in the development of Diabetes Type II where the Beta-cells which produce insulin according to blood sugar eventually are overworked, desensitized and eventually chronically inflamed resulting in pancreatitis. The mitochondria in these regions are ravaged and beaten and end up contributing to the destruction of the region. Mitochondria additionally control the on and off switch for apoptosis (cell death) and can be implicated in cancers (immortal cells, the on/off switch is gone!)The connection between mitochondrial health and these modern diseases following the 1950s is infallible. However, indirectly, synthetic ways of life, the capitalistic societies we live in, and disregard for community health promote environments where mitochondrial damage is inevitable. The real conspiracy I am attempting to illuminate is the disregard for viewing ENERGY as source of disease rather than just MATTER. I consider this as logical, given life in a materialistic society, focused on body parts or organs being diseased, however these organs would not exist without ENERGY.
<|endoftext|>[Hilary Koprowski]( invented the first "effective" live polio vaccine, and used monkey and chimpanzee parts to make them.[Albert Sabin]( the other main producer of the polio vaccine at the time, analyzed Koprowski's "oral" vaccine and found that it was "unstable and contaminated by an unknown virus." In response, Koprowski claimed that Sabin was trying to discredit his work.As it happens, Sabin was also manufacturing a contaminated polio vaccine with a *different* lethal virus: [SV40]( to the [oral polio vaccine AIDS hypothesis]( 1957 to 1960, after years of tinkering with monkey kidneys and polio germs, Dr. Hilary Koprowski tested his own experimental polio vaccine on 325,000 equatorial Africans, including 75,000 citizens of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo.98% of the vaccine recipients were infants and toddlers. The youngest children received 15 times the adult dosage. Though Koprowski claimed he had the backing of the World Health Organization, WHO denied sanctioning the large-scale trials.In 1959, Dr. Albert Sabin reported in the British Medical Journal that Koprowski's polio vaccine used in the African trials contained an "unidentified" cell-killing virus. It was never identified. However, in 1986 the earliest known blood sample containing antibodies against HIV was traced back to 1959. The serum came from a patient visiting a clinic in Leopoldville.Koprowski's vaccine was not approved for human use, so it was discontinued in 1960 following the African trials. Thus, it was only administered to inhabitants of the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi--the precise area where high levels of HIV infection were identified by researched 30 years later. Furthermore, the AIDS virus is known to infect mucous cells, prevalent in the mouth. The African vaccines were squirted into people's mouths.
<|endoftext|>The CDC is a revolving door that has blurred the lines between Big Pharma and Big Government.In 2004, [CDC scientist William Thompson expressed his concerns]( that the agency was engaged in a coverup of the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism.Thompson attempted to notify his superior at the time, [Julie Gerberding]( 2004, whistleblower Thompson [wrote her a letter]( in which he warned her that he had sensitive and troubling data about the MMR vaccines connection to autism. He was shortly due to present the data at a major vaccine/autism conference.Apparently, Gerberding didnt answer the letter, and Thompsons presentation was canceled.After Gerberding left the CDC in 2009, she ascended to the position of president of Merck Vaccines. Merck manufactures the MMR vaccine.Interestingly, in December of 2014, Merck removed Gerberding from her august position and placed her in a new role, a role that never existed within the company before: executive vice-president for strategic communications, global public policy and population health.Did Merck make this move to shield Gerberding, to protect her from a possible scandal tying her to the 2004 MMR-autism fraud at the CDC? If there is a Congressional hearing, will Gerberding be conveniently unavailable because she is overseas tending to her new international duties at Merck?The flu vaccine is [another major cash cow]( for the CDC:The CDC employs straight PR lies [when it counts the number of flu deaths every year]( in the US.For example, Peter Doshi wrote a particularly damning analysis for the journal BMJ Online (December 2005), stating:[According to CDC statistics], influenza and pneumonia took 62,034 lives in 200161,777 of which were attributable to pneumonia and 257 to flu, and in only 18 cases was the flu virus positively identified.The CDC created one category that combines both flu and pneumonia deaths, assuming that the pneumonia deaths are complications stemming from the flu.This is an absurd assumption. Pneumonia has a number of causes. But even worse, in all the 2001 flu and pneumonia deaths, only 18 revealed the presence of an influenza virus. Therefore, the CDC couldnt truthfully say that more than 18 people died of influenza in 2001. Not 36,000 deaths, the usual PR statistic. 18 deaths.Doshi continued his assessment of published CDC flu-death statistics: Between 1979 and 2001, [CDC] data show an average of 1348 [flu] deaths per year (range 257 to 3006). These figures refer to flu separated out from pneumonia.This death toll is obviously far lower than the parroted 36,000 figure. But it would drop much lower, if you added the need to confirm the presence of a flu virus in those cases.The CDC is a PR agency.

All children presented with acute flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs that reached peak severity within 48 hours of onset...All had been previously vaccinated against polio-virus.In addition, [47,500 cases of vaccine-induced polio paralysis followed an oral polio vaccination campaign]( conducted by the GAVI Alliance, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Health Organization (WHO) in India in 2011.The oral polio vaccine was given to Indian children, despite the fact that in the US, the CDC had dropped the OPV from its vaccine schedule [*because it was causing polio.*]( to Neetu Vashisht and Jacob Puliyel at St. Stephens Hospital in Delhi:The charade about polio eradication and the great savings it will bring has persisted to date. It is a paradox that while the director general of WHO and Bill Gates are trying to muster support for polio eradication it has been known to the scientific community, for over 10 years, that eradication of polio is impossible.This is because in 2002 scientists had synthesized a chemical called poliovirus in a test-tube with the empirical formula C332,652H492,388N98,245O131,196P7, 501S2,340.

In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received.

<|endoftext|>The ultimate medical conspiracy is the historical fact that it has, for thousands of years, increased death rates while reducing birth rates and lifespan. For Pre 20th century medicine our modern official consensus recognizes this.  Modern medicine likes to take credit for the population explosion of the last century but in reality the cause of this is that bloodletting and completely excessive doses of poisons fell out of Vogue as the immediate response to every ailment..  Or in other words medicine was made slightly less lethal.
<|endoftext|>Everybody knows this by now, Cannabis was recognized as medicine by experts in the 1880's.From Dr. Beard (1889):**HEADACHE**: I have myself been a frequent sufferer from this disease, and have experimented thoroughly on myself and on others with nearly all of the well-known remedies and systems of treatment. My conclusion is, that sick headache is much more relievable and curable than is commonly supposed.Almost all cases can be relieved in less than ten hours, sometimesin half an hour. The disease is a very common one. It visits nearly every household.It is, moreover, a disease that patients are usually obliged to treat themselves.The plan of treatment which I propose, and which I usuallyfind more or less successful, is as follows:1. Begin treatment early, before the disease is at its height.This rule is as important in the treatment of sick headache as inthe treatment of a common cold. (See Common Cold.) Commencetreatment as soon as you suspect that an attack is coming on.Some persons can foretell when they are to have an attack forseveral hours in advance; others have very little warning.2. Take 1 or 2 grains (.06 or .12 gram) of citrate of caffeinedry on the tongue. Repeat the dose in half an hour if there is norelief. Some can bear 3 or 4 grains (.18 or .24 gram) at a dose.Begin with moderate doses. This is a wonderful remedy for sick headache. I have calledthe attention of many physicians to this, and their results confirmmine. Caffeine is easy to take, is not unpleasant, is not dangerousin moderate doses. It is the active principle common to coffee,tea, chocolate, and guarana. It acts in some cases, when just theproper dose is taken, with magical power. The only objectionto its use is that it keeps one awake if taken late in the evening.One can take it and go right on about the routine of business.Take a pill of cannabis indica (Indian hemp),  or 1/3 of a grain(.03 or .02 gram). Repeat in half an hour if necessary, or doublethe dose.This remedy sometimes succeeds when caffeine fails, or whencaffeine has worn out its virtue by long use.3. The following pill :   Extract of cannabis indica,  drachm (2 grams),   " "guarana, 1   scruple (1.87 gram),   Citrate of caffeine, 1 drachm (4 grams),Mix, and make into sixty pills.DOSE. -Take one pill and repeat the dose in one hour if necessary.TL:DR I present this as evidence of medical corruption coming from outside the community of Doctors; their recommendations sidelined by conspiratorial agenda. While I know this is mainstream now, it remains clear evidence that severe Medical Conspiracy occurred, and thus, probably *is occurring*.
<|endoftext|>[HIV = AIDS Deconstructing The Myth Of AIDS ]( research has failed because it has never really found the cause.Over **100,000** research papers published on HIV/AIDS and there was no direct proof that HIV causes AIDS. It took less money and scientific talent to land on the moon. We have spent over 40 Billion (1995, time of this movie) dollars already.What exactly is killing the T-Cells that allow opportunistic infections in?Who was first to say it was even a retrovirus? Dr. Robert Gallo. He failed to prove retroviruses caused cancer in his previous decades work. Also he had NOT submitted his test results (for HIV/AIDS) for peer review before an important conference telling the world that it was HIV that causes AIDS. Added to that, The Institute Pasteur in Paris claimed that Gallo's "AIDS" Virus was actually their discovery (LAV) they sent him 6 months prior to a conference in 1984. Dr. Luc Montagnier (who discovered HIV) has even stated "HIV might be benign."April 23 1984;The press conference that invented the aids virus. It was also stated they would have a cure within two (1986) years. As the Press conference was going on... ...the blood test used to detect HIV was being patented, which would earn large royalties for Gallo and his ilk.The previously mentioned test results were then published a week after this conference in Science magazine. When it was more thoroughly examined, "Only 44 of 93 AIDS patients tested had the virus (HIV) ~ less than half" Yet, Gallo claims in "further studies he could find HIV in 90% of AIDS patients tested." Dr. Peter Duesberg Ph D of Berkley (considered by some, the foremost retrovirus analyzer - first to map genomes of virus' etc) in 1987 put out a review claiming HIV is not causing AIDS. He also claimed HIV is an old harmless virus that has been in humans for centuries. Nobel Prize winners Dr. Walter Gilbert and Dr. Kary Mullis also question the validity of HIV = AIDS.Several of these men and women formed The Group for Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis. The letter they sent was rejected by Nature Magazine, the New England Journal, JAMA and The Lancet. It was only four sentances long."It is widely believed by the general public that a retrovirus called HIV causes a group of diseases called AIDS. Many bio-medical scientists now question this hypothesis. We propose a thorough reappraisal of the existing evidence for and against this hypothesis be conducted by a suitable independent group. We further propose that critical epidemiological studies by devised and undertaken." The Group for Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS HypothesisAfter it was rejected, the Group obtained more than the ten to 12 original signatures - it jumped to 30, than 50, 100, and than 600 (188 of which had advanced degrees). They have a website and newsletter of their own, but this Group is ignored by the media and publishers of mainstream magazines.10 Scientific reason why HIV does not cause AIDS;**1**) HIV (*like any other viruses*) is harmless after antibody immunity. The HIV test searches for the antibodies that are produced to subdue HIV. When a person tests positive to HIV they are immune to the Virus at this point. "There is no known diseases that ever reemerge to cause the illness after the antibodies have done their job."**2**) HIV does not kill the T-Cells it infects. HIV researchers use T-Cells to grow the Virus because T-Cells live compatibly with HIV. Retroviruses (unlike animal and other known viruses) do not kill cells, ever.**3**) HIV does not infect enough T-Cells to cause AIDS. HIV only infects 1 out of 1,000 T-Cells (and sometimes 1 out of 100,000). T-Cells can reproduce at the rate of 5% per day. HIV cannot infect enough T-Cells to completely shift the balance. Simple math~ **4**) HIV has no AIDS causing gene. HIV has no unique reason to cause AIDS. All retroviruses have only three major genes; GAG, ENV and POL and only six minor genes. 50-100 different retroviruses infect every healthy human body. All are kept under control by the antibodies. "HIV behaves no differently than other retroviruses."**5*) There is no such thing as a slow virus. HIV is said to take 10-12 years after infection to cause AIDS. This would give HIV "magical abilities" such as; Reactivating, Mutating, Migrating and Hibernating. A retrovirus has effects within days, or weeks (at the most 3 weeks) - all of them, including HIV. It is impossible for HIV to take 10-12 years to activate and cause AIDS.**6**) HIV is not a new virus, so it could not cause a "new" epidemic. Aids cases have increased from 0 (1980) to half a million (1996). It must be a new infection to cause the recent AIDS epidemic. Essential Logic: How old is HIV? and where does it come from? HIV is old (older than America) and should not create an epidemic now. HIV has been passed down through every generation for centuries without causing AIDS.**7**) HIV fails Kock's Postulates...which "are four criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a causative microbe (HIV) and a disease (AIDS)." The organism must;   1. ...be Found in all Cases of the Disease.10-20% of AIDS patients have no HIV at all.Only tiny amounts of the dormant virus are found.   2. ...be Isolated from the Host and Grown in Pure Culture.   3. ...Cause the Same Disease when injected into a new healthy host.Health care workers accidently infected rarely get AIDS unless they use recreational drugs and AZT (their cure...).   4. ...Must be Found Growing Again in the Newly-Diseased Host.**8**) AIDS has remained in it's original risk groups for over 12 years... when an epidemic strikes it affects small groups and then multiplies to the rest. If a disease does not spread...it must be caused by something non-infectious. AIDS Risk groups:  Homosexual Males 62%  IV Drug Users    32%  Hemophiliacs      1%  Transfusion Patients 2%    Total         97%If AIDS is truly caused by a Virus...AIDS patients not in the Risk Groups above should be growing above the remaining 3%. AIDS has failed to spread to the female population also. HIV Tests on US Army recruits from 1985-1996 show a spread of 50/50. Yet 9 out of 10 who develop AIDS is Male. More than half of the woman (and 80% of males) with AIDS use IV Drugs. AIDS seems to be more related to behaviour and certain medical risks than it is to HIV infection.**9**) The international profile of AIDS patients is inconsistent. Germ-related diseases affect the same demographics world-wide. This is not the case when American and African results were concluded;America: 90% Male 10% Female (97% in Risk Groups)Africa: 50% Male 50% Female (No Risk Groups)AIDS hits harder in industrialized nations (America and Europe) because it is believed that more IV Drug use is rampant. Dr. Duesberg even believes that the AIDS strain in Africa is a different one than in America. "Different as day and night."Philippe Krynem (French Humanitarian) posted in the London Sunday Times (October 3, 1993) "There is no AIDS, it is something that has been invented." After spending time in the so-called "epicenter" of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.**10**) AIDS occurs without HIV infection. Most people with HIV never develop AIDS. "The evidence in support of HIV is based *solely* on correlation." Correlation does not prove causation. If HIV is a harmless passenger Virus we should see: "People with AIDS not infected with HIV" and "People with HIV who are healthy and do not get AIDS." That is exactly what is happening. There are 4,621 (in 1993) documented cases where patients with AIDS do not have HIV.

<|endoftext|>Is there any way to reverse mitochondrial damage? I'm someone that has suffered from a chronic health condition that's associated with mitochondrial dysfunction - I know that recovery from this disease is possible, but I'm curious about whether mitochondrial damage is permanent. 
<|endoftext|>Most of what you're saying is true but blaming your beer belly on local mitochondria is just plain stupid. I'm a kinesiology undergrad and I know that no mitochondria are static in the way you're proposing. Having a beer belly can be much more easily explained by the hormonal factors associated with gender and motor neuron recruitment and patterns. More fat utilization in one area=more storage in that area.

<|endoftext|> The real conspiracy I am attempting to illuminate is the disregard for viewing ENERGY as source of disease rather than just MATTER. I consider this as logical, given life in a materialistic society, focused on body parts or organs being diseased, however these organs would not exist without ENERGY.I had/received this insight during an ayahuasca ceremony, but this paints it in a more scientific light. Fascinating. Can you share more of your thoughts & findings on this?

<|endoftext|>Nursing student who has worked for 5 years as a PCT here: I never got the flu shot until hospitals required them, and it still pisses me off. 1.) if a patient is admitted with the flu, I am required to wear a gown, gloves, mask, and sometimes face sheild to care for them. Why would I have to wear all that if the flu shot is effective?2.) why do I have to get the flu shot if I am going to be wearing all of this PPE anyway? I am exposed to way more infectious diseases on a regular basis than the flu, yet have never caught any of them or spread them to someone I know. 3.) the flu vaccine can cause guillain burre syndrome which paralyzes your entire body, I've had about a dozen patients in the past few years with this disease, a few of which were confirmed to be from the vaccine4.) the flu shot isn't even effective statistically, and one year was only 6% effectiveI am totally for vaccinating against deadly or debilitating diseases, but the flu is not one of them.

<|endoftext|>The 47500 cases of polio link doesn't work anymore, and it was removed from the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (my usual link for showing people  after the Ivory Tower applied pressure.The way back machine has it stored though:  India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Also, this info is great:  1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the principal if not sole cause of all reported polio cases in the U.S. since 1961** [44]. (The virus remains in the throat for one to two weeks and in the feces for up to two months. Thus, vaccine recipients are at risk, and can potentially spread the disease, as long as fecal excretion of the virus continues [45].) In 1992, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an admission that the live-virus vaccine had become the dominant cause of polio in the United States [36]. In fact, **according to CDC figures, every case of polio in the U.S. since 1979 was caused by the oral polio vaccine** [36]. Authorities claim the vaccine was responsible for about eight cases of polio every year [46]. However, an independent study that analyzed the governments own vaccine database during a recent period of less than five years uncovered 13,641 reports of adverse events following use of the oral polio vaccine. These reports included 6,364 emergency room visits and 540 deaths (Figure 3) [47,48]. Public outrage at these tragedies became the impetus for removing the oral polio vaccine from immunization schedules [36:568;37;38].

For obvious reasons, Heroin is no longer used as an anti-tussive.I do believe that cannabis likely has wide range of medical applications (particularly for pain relief), and more research should be done and made available, but I don't think a recommendation from 1889 is particularly strong evidence (at least on its own).

<|endoftext|>The CDC Definition of AIDS:Kaposi Sarcoma + HIV = AIDSKaposi Sarcoma - HIV = Kaposi SarcomaPneumonia + HIV = AIDSPneumonia - HIV = PneumoniaDementia + HIV = AIDSDementia - HIV = DementiaThis is their definition. If you have HIV with a certain disease, you have AIDS, if HIV is not present - it's the fault of the original disease. There is no HIV specific disease anywhere. Such a joke. This definition of AIDS "creates a near 100% correlation between the virus and AIDS." "This 'correlation' is not objective, or scientific and is *deceptively self-fulfilling*."~ as of 1993Estimate of Total HIV infected: 28,000,000? Total of **Officially** reported AIDS cases 1,393,649 (5%)HIV Infected without AIDS: 95%*Estimated *Total Aids cased: 7,700,000???Only 3% of Africans have AIDS with HIV. The other 97% are healthy and without AIDS (even though they have HIV).Some other claims by Dr. Peter Duesberg; "Aids is not infectious," "Not being spread sexually," "Not a threat to the public at large."The hypothesis is that "AIDS is caused by recreational drug use and chemotherapy treatments (AZT)." "IV Drugs are the cause of AIDS in 9 out of 10 cases." At this point (53min'sh) Duesberg shows a chart displaying the dramatic rise of AIDS cases per year compared to HIV. HIV is a flat line (for 10 years), unchanging. Figure it out. He then shows Cocaine and Heroine use applied to his chart, and the rise mirrors that of AIDS cases. But once again, correlation =! causation. Atleast in his examples, the facts are based on reason and science. He makes his case at 54 minutes very well.Nitrates used by homosexual men (poppers) as aphrodesiacs is extremely immuno-suppresant. Rectum tissue is also 1 layer thick (compared to the vagina's 3 layers) which allows for more for foreign protein transfers. These foreign proteins have also been proven to be immuno-suppresant. Also it is known that large amounts of Anti-biotics were/are used by homosexuals which, are as well, immuno-sppresent."You can take any group of homosexual or heterosexual men, HIV positive, but not using poppers, cocaine, heroin, or AZT and they will never get AIDS (Aka sarcoma, turbocuelosis + HIV etc)." ~ says Duesberg. During the AIDS scare AZT is passed in 1987 for use in killing HIV, even though previously it was "too poisonous for cancer treatment." It was tested on animals and deemed "too toxic for use in human beings." AZT is a DNA Chain Terminator, highly mutagenic and randomly targets bone marrow (where Lumphocyte Immune Cells are being made...the very cells needed most by AIDS patients), Kidneys, Liver, Intestines, Muscle Tissue, the Brain and the Central Nervous System. "AZT causes AIDS defining diseases. It was designed to kill human cells."Check out the rest from around ~1:05:00 on.

They are always with you, this I know.What the medical establishment tries to do is become a middle-man of grief by selling you a false remedy.

<|endoftext|>Unless you are doing something that is easy to check, it's unlikely that someone will actually do the experiments again. So if you fake those results, you can get a paper published quite easily.Some fields are inherently much easier to cheat with, and basically all the softer sciences are full of p-hacking and low sample sizes allowing shitty results.But even in harder sciences like physics, some retard that caused clocks to be desynchronized manage to publish faster than light neutrinos. We're at a point where basically only a few papers can be proven right correctly easily: pure mathematical papers, using automated systems that can check your proof, and computer science (though that's kinda math as well I guess), since the cost of running an algorithm is moderate.Now obviously for theoretical physics, the big shit that breaks previous laws is going to be doubted, so other people will do experiments to confirm the results, but the paper still often manages to be published first. For medicine though, you are likely out of luck and big pharma can definitely fake the results of some experiments.I also talk from experience, in my case I was asked no proof of my results or anything, as long as it's not news breaking nobody is likely to check. I put honest results because I have ethics, but I definitely see how easy it would be to fake them, especially if you have grants or graduation hinging over it.

You can also purchase CoQ10 and A-L-C separately but the PQQ combination is a pretty good coverall: Articles for further reading: you probably already do but in case you don't I would follow as strict a dietary regime of fermented foods (ie. kefir, sauerkraut, kombucha tea) +++leafy dark greens, avoiding as much as poss. anything inflamm. and increasing consumption of things rich in anti-inflamm. properties such as turmeric, garlic, ginger etc...vaping or using cannabis, CDB and hydrating+++ with clean water.The Wim Hof method of breathing would be of great value too I would imagine which is basically forced deep breathing the length of your focused period of breathing you can increase as you develop the technique.TLDR - increase the density and specific intake of orthomolecular/macro/micro nutrients, increase clean hydration+++, increase focused respiration+++ and get decent sleep while attempting as best poss. to eliminate inflammatory agents in your life/diet.This is by no means exhaustive or professional advice this is what I find works for me but could be tweaked/improved no doubt.
<|endoftext|>Mitochondria have the DNA structure of a bacteria and often are compared to *Rickettsia*. But, yes, they are certainly organelles that animal cells are codependent on. In a sense these "bacteria" hold the noose around or necks though.
<|endoftext|>I believe the idea is that, since cells themselves are basically the evolution of a number of symbiotic microorganisms, the structure of mitochondria is similar in function to bacteria therefore it may be the best term available to summarize its lifecycle.
<|endoftext|>Travis Christofferson's book "Tripping over the Truth" talks about this theory and the history of how cancer came to be thought of as being caused by genetic mutations.

<|endoftext|>Yes, Seyfried is a pioneer in this field. The amazing thing is that mitochondrial medicine has much to do with preventative medicine. Hopefully we can see a shift in ideology regarding this. There is a famous study where mitochondria are actually used as "bombs" (their typical mode when apoptosis is triggered) to destroy cancer cells through reactivation of suppressed apoptotic signal. ref: *Design and Synthesis of a MAO-B-Selectively Activated Prodrug based on MPTP: A Mitochondria-Targeting Chemotherapeutic Agent for Treatment of Human Malignant Gliomas*, Baskin et al. 2015

<|endoftext|>What I like to remind people is that the word Pharmacy is derived from the word Farm, where back in the good old days, the remedies were found at the local farm to help the sick and ill... I see eyes brows raised when I mention this.Again work in Health Care, the amount of people i see carrying in a bag of medications, I mean some people are taking 10-18 different meds, all mainly Medicare / Medicaid / Tricare insured patients. These people are so fucked up they believe they are lucky to be over treated and the hands of Doctors who are pushed by the Pharmaceutical companies. 
<|endoftext|>You are right, I would not want many treatments mentioned in that (1889) book. Being pre-antbiotics, he often mentions "try this and if that fails, then maybe this..."My point as it applies to the topic is that there was (a now famous) medical blackout of Cannabis-as-medicine in the 20th Century.Dr. Beard further comments that headache affects "every household" and that people are "obliged to treat themselves".So, we have had a hundred years of "take an aspirin and call me in the morning" (Bayer again!)

<|endoftext|>What evidence do you have that we are living longer? Please, I would love to be wrong about this. But when I thought about it, I realised that I was never shown empirical data to prove we were living longer. I was just told over and over again that 'life expectancy has risen', like an Orwellian mantra.Two legs bad, four legs good.
<|endoftext|>He's trying to red-pill the average population on how many people are brainwashed into accepting a life of slavery with hopes of a grand pension and retirement when the prospect of retirement is an illusion. People blindly accept that we're living longer without questioning it, without asking for evidence. If we're told from a young age that we're living longer than ever before, we just accept the fact as a truth. In his metaphor once the cows are finally old enough and worked hard enough for their big payout and retirement, they're led to the slaughterhouse and killed. 
<|endoftext|>What is your point? You think your undocumented, anecdotal observations at one cemetery prove that people are living longer today? 
<|endoftext|> These errors are made by the actual healthcare providers and not big corporations, so it is something that will be fixed, as those who provide healthcare USUALLY actually care about the patients and their well being.If it was up the providers, there would be no errors at all.
<|endoftext|>Being the No. 3 cause of death I rather let an AI to check my vitals, body and give me a diagnosis than a physician (maybe even surgery one day). Don't get me wrong, some people really care and work an insane amount of hours, but i'm pragmatic about results.
<|endoftext|>Wouldnt this number be inflated anyway though? I have no numbers or data for this, but anecdotally, if someone has an illness or injury that would kill them, and they get treatment, more often than not the treatment would work out and they wouldnt die, so it drastically lowers death rates of the disease. But if theres complications and the person dies, no matter what the disease or injury was, they would all be grouped as medical errors? Ive also thought that saying cancer is the top cause of death is just as disingenuous, because there are hundreds of different types of cancers that arise for thousands of different and very complex reasons that have both environmental or genetic origins (or both). Cancer is just the big overarching term for when your cells forget how to kill themselves and keep multiplying, but its not one disease, its more like a characteristic symptom
<|endoftext|>So true that you have to grieve and medication robs you of that lesson. I have a personal theory that this is why the veterans of the Viet Nam War are the most connected to the debilitating PTSD. They used opium heavily throughout their trauma and therefore never processed it properly.

<|endoftext|>I don't know, I can see it. Have you ever done the math on how much blood a patient actually gives for testing during an admission? It's more than one might think. A young patient can handle this no problem, but if you have an elderly patient who is already borderline anemic, and stick them in a hospital bed for 2 weeks, it seems to me like you could definitely pull off a lot of iron.
<|endoftext|>I've worked a lab too. What do you say about this?  the case of blood draws, the volume of blood drawn is significantly increased by unnecessary testing, resulting in higher rates of hospital-acquired anemia. is highly associated with changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels for patients admitted to an internal medicine service and can contribute to anemia. This anemia, in turn, may have significant consequences, especially for patients with cardiorespiratory diseases. Knowing the expected changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit due to diagnostic phlebotomy will help guide when to investigate anemia in hospitalized patients. findings indicate that reducing blood loss from phlebotomy could limit the development and severity of hospital-acquired anemia. **This could be accomplished inexpensively by using smaller blood tubes, such as those made for pediatric patients**, filling standard tubes with less blood, relying more on stored serum samples, or simply reducing unnecessary, scheduled blood tests, according to the authors. I got to work a lab, I've seen the little belt fed pockets that contain samples that are like 50 x less than the vacationers they draw from. Your argument doesn't support you, it supports me.
<|endoftext|>Have you ever tried to fill a pediatric tube?Did it all the time. Now, there are new ways of testing that resemble glucometers that I'm all for that also use finger stick with good efficacy. I would gladly see these replace standard vacutainers.Yea, but most hospitals don't want to buy new equipment when what they have is working.
<|endoftext|> Further, anemia isn't even recommended to be treated by transfusion until it drops below something like 7 g/dL because of the risks associated with transfusion. At the two places I worked we transfused at 8.5The hospital blood bank does not send that many units to the floor.Not true.[Approximately 36,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the U.S]( are not 36,000 stabbings, shootings, and car wrecks every day in the US. These are mostly units of blood going to people whose H/H is low because of phlebotomy.

<|endoftext|>The rise of invisible illnesses in that area What exactly are invisible illnesses?Also, had a family friend who got a bad case of lyme disease and it was mis-diagnosed for *years* as MS. She is still dealing with issues from the lyme disease and it's been close to 10 years since she was diagnosed with it, probably closer to 15 years since she was misdiagnosed with MS. Lyme disease aint no joke. 
<|endoftext|>d121212 is correct. The major ways are: proper diet according to your needs, exercise, and supplementation (COQ10, other "cocktails" which contain enzymes or vitamins, even metformin has been shown in lower doses to assist)Depending on the type of disease you have: primary or secondary, the clinical outlook varies. Primary mitochondrial disorders/dysfunction are typically derived from mother and are often full scale deletions of portions of mitochondrial DNA that relate directly to proteins on the electron transport chain. Imagine a portion of the "circle of energy" (circular mitochondrial DNA) breaks, almost the like the ouroboros breaking.Secondary mitochondrial diseases are lifestyle induced and consequences or comorbidities with common chronic diseases and inflammation. Primary mitochondrial dysfunction can be readily tested through genetic testing, however secondary dysfunction is often a web of nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA that is harder to detect and can be reversed! There are a few upcoming therapies for primary dysfunction, however the treatment is ideally applied pre-conception through maternal screening. For example if a mother believes she may carry a mitochondrial disease, she can have the nucleus of her egg be transplanted on a donor egg with healthy mitochondria (the "three-person baby" phenomenon). The mitochondria has very little to do with developmental phenotype besides providing adequate energy and so I do not see it as a three person baby. 
<|endoftext|>Thanks, I appreciate the insight. I'll look into this further, but I'm glad to hear that it should be possible to reverse damage. 
<|endoftext|>Thank you for this info! I appreciate the advice. I'm familiar with CoQ10, but that's the first time I've ever heard of PQQ. I've got to get my diet back on track, but I was eating a lot of raw fermented foods and ginger before. I'm going to add them back in, along with some more of those anti-inflammatory foods. I also am getting an RO filter installed at my apartment, so I will have clean water shortly. Wim Hof is something that I actually looked into for a long time and researched. Ultimately, I wasn't really comfortable pursuing it, but I did begin taking cold showers/ice baths without the breathing component. I'm in the FB group and I follow any new developments/research involving it, so it's something I might add to my regiment in the future. 
<|endoftext|>I'm just a medical student and my knowledge is limited and I can't give medical advice, but if you want to PM me I'll be happy to share whatever limited knowledge I can in the spirit of mutual empowerment.
<|endoftext|>yeah those darn international yoga corporations destroying the world with their greed, their insatiable desire for getting a 12th yacht.
<|endoftext|>21 days in a row of yoga. And I was the last guy to even think about doing this before a month ago. Its life changing. 
<|endoftext|>Homeopathy may be quack science, but if "medicine" is more harm than cure you are better off with a placebo.Rich people went to homeopaths, because outcomes were better for many things if you just took a placebo, up until just the last few decades.
<|endoftext|>In health care as well. 18 meds is common, double that is common. Most of the chronic disease we see can and should be treated with food first, medications last, but almost never are.
<|endoftext|>I am pretty certain that the military are some of the first ones to get experimental vaccines. Like, first human trial type stuff. Also, do not forget that many of the military bases have VERY nasty water in their supply. I heard of a lawsuit against Camp Lejeune for a lot of sercice members and their families having much higher rates of disease / cancer. I need to look it up for details.  
<|endoftext|>Hey friend, I'm sorry to inform you that you've been shadowbanned by the reddit admins, which is unfortunate because you seem like an honest and legitimate contributor.As a /r/conspiracy mod, I can only approve your comment and inform you of your predicament, sorry :/I recommend you contact the reddit admins ASAP...good luck!
<|endoftext|>Thats all well and good, but that video that linked is literally factless. Its a diatribe on conspiracy. Go ahead, watch it and tell me he offers any proof of *anything*. He just talks and talks about the retirement age being a hoax, but doesnt ever say how the life expectancy hasn't changed. Is it the average age? No actual medical advances? Less death from simple maladies like pneumonia or diarrhea? I mean, there must be a basis for why he thinks there is some sort of hoax or misinformation, but he doesn't delve into it! Frustrating and a waste of 7 minutes. 
<|endoftext|>Here is a link too the CDC page.  is a good PDF in there that shows the steady increase of the age that people are dying. Personally I do not consider a random YouTuber who presented little to no facts and thinks quoting George Orwell will make his point any better. Can you provide any factual data that people are significantly younger?? I found an article that noted a decrease of 0.1 years, but unless that keeps up for many years I do not consider it significant.
<|endoftext|> an average, more people are living into old age(60-70+), its people not dying young from preventable disease, accidents, war, malnutrion, etc, that are raising the average. There has always been people who lived into old age, just far less.I think science wise we are on the verge of extending peoples lives beyond the natural cap of about 70-80 years.
<|endoftext|>So you link a YouTube video with literally no evidence but you can't do a 2 second Google search that would show you literally countless piles of evidence? Do you discredit all sources of this evidence?
<|endoftext|>Do you live in a capitalist country? Your retirement is entirely in your hands. Unless we have a breakdown of society/more collapsed banks. They are fucking with Social Security in America too, but that doesnt mean that you need to be among the people led to the slaughterhouse. The fact that there are old people strugglling to survive is heartbreaking. I wish that the government wouldnt be trying to fuck them more. Sadly, its one of several issues that doesnt get enough coverage. Again though, if you prepare now you dont have to worry about this, for yourself at least.I repeat: **Your retirement is *completely* within your hands**
<|endoftext|> 1900 a 30-year-old male could expect to live to 65, today they could expect to live to 78 late medieval English peerage, "At age 21, life expectancy was an additional 43 years (total age 64)."A 21-year-old member of the English aristocracy could expect to live to age 64 in the 1200s.It's a complete myth that we're no healthier today than in other ages. We live longer and die less of sickness. And lots of people *did* drop dead from illness or childbirth back then.
<|endoftext|>no. quite the contrary. I was backing up your life expectancy hoax conspiracy with my anecdotal observations. this cemetery had dead people from recent times and people who died roughly 80 years ago and they all died in similar age groups and none of the age groups are long lives. my point was that in this one case study my findings suggest that all these people even in quite recent of times all die between 24-66 at the oldest which would back up your claim that we are not 'living longer' I don't know why you had to be a dick but your comment was quite dickish. fyi when people are agreeing with you don't be a dick and try to argue with them. kthanksbai
<|endoftext|>Maybe. Vibration therapy is used by therapist.Sorry this might be a little long. I accidentally may have found a frequency that seems to have ended my FMS overnight. I have had chronic achy pain for 40 years. Not joints just fascia. I literally thought everyone hurt until sitting in a class on fibromyalgia while in school. I never responded well to meds ( or wasn't willing to put up with the side effects). I usually took a tramadol & just kept moving. 2/16 I ended chemo and started a drug that gave me joint pain for the first time ever. 12 months later I stopped it almost unable to walk. My son races cars and we had just bought a large car hauler. Because I could not sleep I climbed into a little bed over the generator . I slept the first time for 10 hrs. When I woke up something was different. The achy pain was gone. A very strange feeling since I live with it everyday. It took 4 months to get the other medicine out of my system and get rid of the joint pain but the familiar aching has really never returned. Sometimes I actually missed it because it was apart of me. I have laid on it a couple of times since but really just because. I have had another reaction to a different medicine so I have about given up on all of them. I have told several drs and they don't know what to think except not to stop. These are drs. That know my history and now I have stopped all but reflux medicine. I was taking meds for chronic migraines but have since stopped them with no problem. ( 20 or so a month).  I hope this wasn't confusing. I wish I knew how to tell what frequency it is. 
<|endoftext|> Could we make it ourselves?Indeed we *can*!  you search you can find plans etc onlineSadly, the Propaganda Big Pharma have used to 'teach' Joe Public 'what to think', has been successful in indoctrinating the 'people' into believing that *only a doctor* has 'the knowledge and skills' to treat people's diseases With *drugs* made by them which can *only* be obtained on prescription are *the only* and *right way* to 'behave' when it comes to 'treating *all* diseases' Big Pharma *are "The* Ultimate (legitimized) Dealers" and the CIA are their 'black market' counterparts. This method of "control and prescription" has been a fabulous method for keeping their customers committed to 'coming back' to their 'brand'! OTOH, what are known as well known *successful* alternative medical treatments, are shunned and vilified by the 'traditional western/allopathic' model of medicine, I.E. acupuncture and 'traditional Chinese medicine' using herbs Or the use of macrophages to treat bacterial infections OR devices like Rife's 'resonators' The 'business methods' used by these ruthless companies is well developed and will continue to oppose *any and all* 'competition' to *their* product. Oil companies have done the same thing for the past 100+years *suppressing* ALL information re: ''alternative energy generation/collection systems" BUT, thankfully the internet has been a Huge facilitator in the advance of Ideas like Rife's (and Tesla et al) and hopefully our future *will include* such technology as scientific developments put the old 'biases' of "conventional medicine" to bed. The medical establishment is a stubborn beast and slow to change! e.g. although it *was clearly demonstrated* in 1986 that a *bacteria* (Helicobacter Pylorii) *caused* stomach ulcers and was easily treated with conventional medications (antibiotics and antacids) ... even twenty years later And I wouldn't be surprised if some doctors *still don't* know about it!**In Fact:** *many* 'doctors' were unaware of this information even *10 yrs later* in the 1990's and some even later! Some maybe not at all!  Even though Big Pharma products are needed to treat it they didn't promote it at all! (Pharma sales reps often keep drs 'up to date' with "the latest" medical news and treatments) Bottom line, when A.I's like Deep Blue begin to make *much better* ''diagnosticians'' that a human doctor who make many precribing errors. Ergo, correct diagnoses (instead of 'educated guesses') will begin to 'subdue' much of the inaccurate and "over prescribing" of Big Pharma's products currently occurring worldwide will stop! (I'm not holding my breath but!)
<|endoftext|>all i saw in my admittedly cursory look was glioblastoma, but the effect on mitchondria implies it would have an effect on a few others. the real trouble with cancer treatment is that there are a lot of ideas that show promise but when we get them into bigger better trials they almost always disappoint. what gets me excited is the possibility that we found out why. it looks like our gut bacteria have been eating cancer drugs. if thats really true and is common with many of the treatments weve tried then we might soon be able to go back and make a huge number of these drugs that failed human tests work, and we might be able to get results with lower doses of the drugs we already use. this is where i want to see money go.
<|endoftext|> believe in the concept of mental illness (i do not)As someone who suffers from OCD, can I ask you to explain why? I see no other way of categorising it.
<|endoftext|>Why don't you believe in mental illness? I understand if you don't believe homosexuality or any other condition isn't a mental illness but it's a little weird to not believe in mental illness at all. 
<|endoftext|>Common sense in the ICU said that we pooled blood draws and only drew as much as we needed and to call the lab to add on tests with extent blood instead of resticking people. The studies showed a correlation between length of stay in the hospital and H&H levels and they account this to be in because of phlebotomy sticks. But, it doesn't say what contributing factors are taking into consideration (e.g.- kidney injury leads to decrease in erythropoietin production and results in decreased blood marrow production and therefore, a decreased H&H or that an increased production of inflammatory bodies from an infection can decrease RBC production). Certainly we want to remove as little blood as possible that's needed, but there are other factors at play in determining anemia causes
<|endoftext|>Yeah, why wouldn't they care? This makes no sense? What possible motive could a cabal of scientists have for covering this up? Do you have any idea how science works? Scientists aren't partners, they're competitors. By and large their strongest desire is to prove other scientists wrong. If any scientist can actually prove a link between vaccines and autism they would shoot to the top of the pantheon of scientists. How could you possibly orchestrate a conspiracy like that in such a competitive environment? This is as absurd as suggesting that all the sprinters in the world have been conspiring to let Usain Bolt win.
<|endoftext|>Chronic illnesses that don't have any visual symptoms. ME, FIBRO, CFS, COLD, EDS etc are all invisible illnesses. My aunt was bit by a tick and is now allergic to all mammals.

She carries epi pens now. 
<|endoftext|>Oh I've been meaning to add to this and then saw your reply/comment. Coffee enemas. Sounds far out/a bit suss to suggest from a complete random over the internet but I would consider it a huge, crucial addition to the above in terms of allowing your body to fully release a lot of the toxicity you carry around. Real easy to DIY no drugs or major medical/scientific knowledge needed either and info abounds on the www.As far as I'm aware there's no deep or mystical psycho-spiritual aspect to Wim Hof's method but I guess he sourced a lot of it from Eastern influences but essentially I think it is just yoga/applied/mindful breathing and is comparable to Groff's "Holotropic" breathwork. At it's extremes I would imagine they could allow OBE/astral experiences tho. Hyper oxygen saturation is a good thing for most people with their postures and hypo-breathing norms.
<|endoftext|>Maybe the flu shot isn't about the flu at all? Maybe it is a vehicle for testing things. Especially now as easily as big data can track your health and everything else about your lifestyle, it *would* be the perfect vector for human experimentation.
<|endoftext|>Per the CDC, it's one of the only vaccines to still contain mercury  Check out the Simpsonwood Transcript where a conference of scientists got together to discuss mercury in vaccines (because of the amount of reports from their patients) since the levels exceed safe levels (any amount shot into the blood stream does).  conference is what "helped" remove mercury from (most) vaccines and replaced it with aluminium (because of their findings and debate). Aluminium is no better and there have been no tests that show the effect both mercury and aluminium have on the body with combined.
<|endoftext|>Agree 100% Work in health care in the US and have done for 16 years, it's all a load of me bollix with that Flu shot bullshit.
<|endoftext|>This is such a fallacy, I personally believe in medicine but if you think it's harmful that's your perogative. My only confusion is how that justifies homeopathy - even if medicine is harmful, how is literal superstition any better. Find an alternative medicine with ACTUAL science behind it like drinking green tea and excercising regularly or some shit, don't use homeopathy and don't encourage others to do so, it's just misinformation.
<|endoftext|>That is a link. It is not proof. Tell us **which part** of that link you found most convincing. You can't, because you haven't read it - you have simply google searched and posted the link. You are proving the point being made.
<|endoftext|> I think science wise we are on the verge of extending peoples lives beyond the natural cap of about 70-80 years.lol that is what the TV keeps telling us, 'medical breakthrough on the horizon'. They call it **programming** for a reason.
<|endoftext|>I asked you if you had any evidence. When did it become so offensive to people to ask them for evidence? And when did 'just google it' become an argument?I don't know how long people are living. The video in question makes the same point: everybody believes we are living longer but nobody seems to have any evidence. Your 'just google it' is implicit proof of the very point being made.
<|endoftext|>Well, minus the 15% of what you earn that the government takes from you to wisely invest so you don't just spend it on a junket or an exciting new vehicle or something.

That's an amazing story ... imho you should do an IaMA or something about it ... I think you're correct in 'guessing' a 'connection' between that generator's effect on you and it would be well worth seeing if anyone else has had a similar experience Sometimes I actually missed it because it was apart of me.Lol, I actually know what you mean! I had a terrible back pain for over a decade which was 'cured' with surgery, and I too *kindof* 'missed it' when it was gone, as, it *was* a 'part of me/my day' and affected *everything* I did! IME people who 'feel this way' have been through a 'personal hell' and escaping from it seems kind of 'surreal' ... like something's *missing*! Which it *is*! I guess that's another demonstration of how well we/our bodies can adapt to all sorts of things
<|endoftext|> Why don't you believe in mental illness?i don't believe in mental illness because i regard mental illness as a metaphor which has been taken literally for so long that people regard it as an objective fact. to illustrate what i mean, consider the following parable:*susan told anthony that jan was hot under the collar. anthony immediately got out a thermometer and began measuring the temperature beneath jan's collar. moments later, he perplexedly announced that he could find no evidence that susan's assertion was true.* I understand if you don't believe homosexuality or any other condition isn't a mental illness but it's a little weird to not believe in mental illness at all. to keep things country simple: i regard homosexuality as an unfortunate tendency, homosexual actions as sins, and belief in mental illness as credulous.
<|endoftext|>That sounds pretty reasonable, and like something an astute nurse would do, but as someone who has worked ICU, Cath lab, OR, and ER as an RN, I can assure there is nothing more uncommon than common sense.
<|endoftext|>Of course it's just an anecdote, but I've known a lot of people that have been patients in the ICU, and the only ones that needed blood transfusions were with the ones with blood loss from trauma.I had a relative that suffered trauma from her husband, and didn't realize til 2 days later when she passed out that her spleen had ruptured. She had a shitload of transfusions.
<|endoftext|>It is the most amazingly frustrating thing in the world to watch someone's H&H drop the longer they stay in the hospital. "Oh, it's dilutional," yeah sure, not if their platelets and everything else didn't go down with it. Can't believe I never thought of iatrogenic blood loss.
<|endoftext|>I've worked as a circulator nurse in the OR, there are very few types of surgeries where blood loss is significant, when we do orthopedic surgeries we have surgical tourniquets. It is still the phlebotomy. I've already provided you links showing you it is the phlebotomy.

<|endoftext|> why don't they care? $$$ the rich want more autists as they are easier to control, more compliant, less violent. It was done on purpose, same as flouride in water and plastics in food,
<|endoftext|>Thanks for adding that. I've actually heard about coffee enemas before, it's just something I've never wanted to try for obvious reasons haha. But as I start improving my health, I will re-consider that. For Wim Hof, the main reason why I didn't opt for it is that I wasn't comfortable with the huge adrenaline spikes it causes. I'm a little wary of tinkering with my endocrine system in that way. But I do know it can have major health benefits and it is something that I may take up in the future. I'm hoping there will be more research studies coming out soon.
<|endoftext|>Well, it is a vehicle for testing things. Among other things, testing theories and techniques for achieving compliance with advertised messages. (It being a yearly campaign with very similar goals and execution every year, and nice measurable endpoints for success or failure, it is an ideal experimental platform for developing the field of propaganda.)
<|endoftext|>I personally believe in medicine as well, but I have no illusions over how harmful medicine was in the 1750s when homeopathy was invented. Considering that medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death, even modern medicine can be quite dangerous.If a serious medical error hasn't happened *to you* that's fine, that's your prerogative to have blind faith in medicine. However, as someone who works in hospitals, I don't.
<|endoftext|>You're misunderstanding them. They aren't defending homeopathy, they're saying if homeopathy does nothing -- which you agree with -- and the medical treatment does actual harm, then you're better off doing nothing, i.e. homeopathy.
<|endoftext|>sorry to hear that =/I do think you need an email address to get your account restored, but I could be wrong about that.
<|endoftext|>I did read it... I can't link a PDF on here but the one titled "Life expectancy by age, race, and sex, 1900-2012 United States Life Tables, 2012" apecificly Figure 1 on page 5. check it out and let us know what you think. They are using actual mortality data to produce this. The burden of proof is not on me here. You are the one that needs to provide factual evidence to support your claims, because it goes against what everyone else already believes and knows. A YouTube video of a guy with an accent is not factual evidence. Although I don't actually expect you to provide any evidence, maybe just another YouTube video, which doesn't count as evidence in my book. Or you just won't respond because you can't find any evidence and would rather just believe what you want to believe. Also what is the motive behind this "Conspiracy"??
<|endoftext|>awww just as I thought. No response from /u/Step2TheJep yet he seems to be active on this post in the recent hour. What is wrong? You said up above you would love to be wrong I was never shown empirical data to prove we were living longerI provided you with actual data....
<|endoftext|>Tell us **which part** of that video you posted provides any information refuting official statistics. Go ahead. You are so deep into your own brain that you post a link thats *worthless* and then challenge someone else to provide proof otherwise. Then when they do, you say That is a link. It is not proof. Tell us which part of that link you found most convincing.Like...for real? Are you okay? If you were informed on the subject, you'd be able to discuss this in depth here in these comments. Instead, you play some game where you are trying to get other people to research for you?I read the .pdf he posted. Did you? It certainly has information in it that refutes your point. But wait, what is your point? You haven't said anything useful, and even worse, the video you posted is seriously underwhelming and doesn't directly refer to anything factual about **any** age study. He just hammers the Australian govt. for increasing the retirement age and describes how people are upset, while using Animal Farm to draw parallel's. Seriously man, don't post shit if you have **no basis and no ability** to back up what you post.
<|endoftext|>Do you know what plasma protein GDF-11 is?How about Regenokene?How about the latest stem cell research?None of that will be on the evening news. You have to go to Germany to even find people researching these things. Hows that for a conspiracy? Other governments are seriously taking huge steps, but American Universities and research teams are hampered by US law. Stem cell research should never have been fucked with. But I'm just programmed to be duped into believing this research, right?
<|endoftext|>Your point is literally that that video has no evidence, and all other evidence is questionable as well. But that we should 'be looking into it'.Fucking lame dude. 
<|endoftext|>I guess that's a good point, but I've never seen any evidence to the contrary, and frankly I don't see a motive behind lying about something like that. But I'd be open to reading any sources you might have
<|endoftext|>Yes that is how I feel. I have hurt for 40+ years but really felt lucky that I never had joint pain and I was so use to it that things like childbirth was snap. It is really strange for it to be gone.  What is an IME. I don't really know much about Reddit.  But their is a therapist here in town doing vibration therapy but it is standing and at 20 minute intervals. 
<|endoftext|>I don't have blind faith in medicine. I just have blind faith in homeopathy being bullshit. Because it is.
<|endoftext|>That is "life expectancy at birth." It's okay to use that in some arguments, but not for arguing that we need to increase retirement age. You don't want to count all of the people who died shortly after birth because those people didn't get to retire. In today's world, everything is safe. We don't have children working in coal mines and factories, we have all kinds of rules for driving, safety standards everywhere. When someone says "we need to increase retirement age because people are living longer," what they are essentially arguing is that retired people are more fit and healthy today, they can do satisfactory labor at 65, and live more years in retirement, which causes a burden on the system. You only want to compare people who lived to 65 in 1900 and life expectancy of people who are 65 today. You can probably find that somewhere and I wouldn't be surprised to see that retirement-age people are living longer today because fewer people smoke, fewer people worked in shitty factories as kids, etc. Once a person reaches 65, how long should they live on average?
<|endoftext|> But I'm just programmed to be duped into believing this research, right?No, you might have evidence. Let's find out. What is your evidence?
<|endoftext|> It is mathematically impossible for it to be the phlebotomy.And yet you've read three peer reviewed published studies showing it is the phlebotomy.\\\_()_/
<|endoftext|>Of course it is. It's still a shitload better than leeching and mercury (which was top-of-the-line care when homeopathy was invented).Even in modern medicine, placebo is better than treatment sometimes.
<|endoftext|>Did you mean to reply to /u/Step2theJep ?? Cause I think we are on the same side, in saying that he has yet to provide any data other than a narrator video of some australian complaining about the retirement age. NO data about life expectancy. Clearly this guy is a shill trying to discredit other conspiracies. 
<|endoftext|>Yet you have not shown any empirical data that we aren't... Why do you even care so much? This isn't really even a conspiracy. What, are you worried you aren't going to live as long as 'they' say you are?? The biggest factor in how long you will live is yourself and no one else.
<|endoftext|>Wtf? Evidence for what? Look up GDF11 and figure it out for yourself, I'm not here to teach you about it. I've clashed with you twice today. From two different parts of this thread. In both you are doing the same lame shit (Burden of proof, challenging others to present evidence and not presenting any yourself) that is indicative of shilling. If you are a shill, and some random internet user like me is out-arguing you with ease, then you suck at your job. Fuck you and the zionist pigs you work for. They should do a better job recruiting. 
<|endoftext|>Like I said I am open to being wrong! But do *you* have any sources I can look into? Or are you just going to ask pointless questions?
<|endoftext|>I do know that in The US the life expectancy for certain segments of the white population declined for the first time in recent history-mostly due to suicide and drug overdose. But I'd like to see real data on this, it is very interesting. I can't believe that video went on and on and he didn't even come close to stating facts or data on the subject-like what?
<|endoftext|> I will concede that, with new information that was not presented in your articles, intensive care patients do lose enough blood to cause iatrogenic anemia.Okay
<|endoftext|>Yes I have seen the information you posted, and it is very interesting. But 1/10 of year is not a "conspiracy" as the OP would like us to believe. There is no power or group trying to make us die sooner, this discussion of life expectancy doesn't even belong on this sub in the first place.

<|endoftext|>So ill type what I've researched that relates to this roundtable. First I would like to start with the dogon tribe in Africa. They go way back and are believed to have originated from Egypt. Anyhow, in the 1930s some anthropologists visited them and asked some questions, they got on the topic of astrology and were astounded at some of the things they heard. The dogon told the anthropologists about the Sirius cluster back when many thought it was just one star they also compared the size difference accurately between the two stars and claimed that sirius-b was a white dwarf with a 50 year orbit around Sirius-a, they also knew about Uranus and Neptune. Now we come to find out later that all of theur claims have been verified. Again they made these claims before we even knew sirius b existed. Even the orbit of Sirius b comes out to be 50.1 years exactly. Obviously the anthropologists asked where they learned this astrological knowledge, and they said it was given to them by our creators, the nommo/nummo. They depict them as fish like humanoid beings which coincidentally are similar to depictions throughout other cultures, especially mesopotamian cultures. The rest of the creation myth aspects weve learned from them are pretty interesting, but all of this brings me to the enki enlil aspect. Watch or read Mauro Biglino if you have not yet heard of him and are interested in this stuff. Mauro was a prominent translator for the Vatican and some of their most ancient texts. He translated the oldest versions of the bible. Whats interesting is the interpretation, he was only allowed to interpret the words in the way the Vatican wanted them translated. When he translates the words the way he believes they were meant to be read the bible takes on a whole new meaning. Mauro is not a Christian and thinks the new testament is mainly fiction and that the old testament is a first hand account or diary of sorts from people that were living through an alien invasion/enslavement of mankind. The idea is that humans are millions of years old as a species and when earth was tiamat it got struck by another planet or ravaged by space war, and this species(elohim/annunaki) was on the losing side of the battle and got stranded on earth. The story in the bible also suggests the elohim altered our DNA while they were here. I've even read theories that the elite believe they descend from these bloodlines and that's why they have a divine right to rule in their minds. So all in all I would strongly suggest you all look into Mauro Biglino as well as the nommo and the dogon tribe, sorry if this was poorly put together, dont usually make this huge comments lol Edit:  to translated discussion by mauro biglino, 6 part series the other parts are linked in video)
<|endoftext|>Copy paste from older thread.Whether it be Planet X, Nibiru, Nemesis, whatever you want to call it, I don't understand why the 'conspiracy' subreddit is so quick to call it bullshit.Let's look at the indicators.- Every ancient civilisation leaving writing and legends about cosmic cataclysms being a regular thing. Some of them even going so far as to have their whole society revolve around tracking them.- NASA going from 'Planet X is bullshit' - 'There might be a planet x' - `There is a planet x we just don't know where it is yet' - 'Our sun might have a binary twin'.- Compelling evidence from whistle-blowers and investigators that billions have been spent over the last few decades building underground bases/cities in the USA and all over the world.- Revalations, Mayan astronomy, The Law of One all indicating that the next one is around this time.- Solid archaeological evidence continuing to surface of previous cataclysms (Hancock)- Increased erratic behaviour of natural disasters and climate change, with evidence that the magnetic field of large celestial bodies influences these things.Now one of these points isn't cause for concern. But all of them, when viewed together, seem to indicate that this threat is real and it's coming. And here we all are arguing over bullshit, calling each other shills, and labelling everything a psyop.
<|endoftext|>For starters, I've always been fascinated by the parallels between the ancient Sumerian epics and the theories of some astronomers like [Tom Van Flandern]( idea is there used to be a Saturn-sized oceanic planet between Jupiter and Mars (Tiamat) and it was destroyed in a cosmic battle, leaving behind the asteroid belt, comets, and possibly other objects like "Nibiru", Ceres etc.Van Flandern traced back the paths of scores of comets and found they converged at that location roughly 2 million years ago.Considering that we are in the process of reevaluating everything we thought we knew about the timeline of human history, it seems highly plausible that such a major event in the solar system would have been recorded in our most ancient lore.As for how the planet "exploded", that's a whole different matter...
<|endoftext|>If I have a general *belief* on human origin, this is it. I dont preach it and I dont necessarily believe every detail of it, but for the most part I just think this makes sense mostly because Ive always felt, almost instinctively, that we are an introduced species. The summary of it is that the Annunaki landed on earth at Euphrates River and colonised the first settlement of Eden. Their *mission* here was supposedly to mine gold to fix their home planet atmosphere. However the work was tough and environment didnt suit them and so they genetically created man - an Annunaki-great ape hybrid. We were to be their labour force - not too smart to question our creators but not too dumb so that we couldnt complete complex tasks. At some point they left earth and left us to our own devices. As primitive hunter-gathers we survived. At some other point in time they returned to teach us civilisation and they left again, forever. Where I think the strongest evidence of this (or something close to this) are;  in ancient texts, including the bible. in ancient culture including Sumerian, Aztec, Egyptian, Peruvian, Incan, Australian Aboriginal, and Easter Island. Sitchen transcripts.  Pye research (see Lloyd Pye). [Here]( is Pye at his best in my opinion. Stay with it. Its a bit strange at first.  in that humankind seemingly stepped away from nomadic, primitivism, and almost within a generation learnt all the sciences and social sciences. global megaliths which I could talk about all night, but specifically their alignment and positioning. [This]( is easily my favourite video on the topic (buckle in, its mind blowing). elongated skulls and otherworldly skeletons. I found [this]( to be fairly comprehensive on most discoveries to date while remaining reasonably objective.  the lack of a missing link of human evolution.  humankinds [fused chromosome 2](  and as I said above, the simple fact that I just believe humans are an introduced species.Anyway thats me for now. I cant wait to read this thread as it fills up and contribute more. EDIT: Added some links. EDIT: Stumbled across [this]( video on mummified aliens last night. 
<|endoftext|>I am extremely discouraged to see that this has not even been mentioned here in this sub... Nibiru has already been pretty much established as a scientific possibility. No one really talked about it besides a few publications. Appalled that no one here remembers those articles. There is no speculation about it being a conspiracy. enough credibility for ya? :)For those of you who still disbelieve, this is as real as it gets.
<|endoftext|>I already posted this on a different subreddit. Anyway this is titled: Possible Geologic Effects on Earth due to Nibiru fly-by. First I've asked myself, what are the known and possible effects of the moon on Earth's present existence as we know it? 1: Ocean Tides 2: Axial tilt allowing for variable seasons through each part of the globe 3: (Theory) - According to [this National Geographic article]( lunar cycle may play a role in Earth's volcanic activity. &nbsp;Assuming a brown dwarf will have a gravitational pull exponentially greater than the moon's but at same time be much, much further away, I wildly speculate the geological effects will be somewhat 5 to 10 times greater in each of the 3 "effects" I've listed. &nbsp;Based on Zecharia's Sitchin 3600 year Nibiru orbit/flyby interval and assuming the Minoan eruption of 1600BC (circa 3600 years ago from present) was the last occurence, these were notable supporting geologic effect: 1.) BBC: [Giant wave hit ancient Scotland [3600x2 = 7200 years ago]]( 2.) As a result of the fly-by, Greenland (for argument's sake) may end up having a longitude similar to where southern Canada is at the present; thus Greenland may allow for more arable land during the "summer time". The closest "coincidence" supporting this theory of a major axial tilt, is that the Sahara dessert was once a plush green grassland with river's flowing through it. Unfotunately I can't come across a solid date for it; here's a article by [the smithsonian]( 3.) And of course the [minoan eruption]( around 3600 years, that supposedly played a role, in Europe's first (as we know it) civilization, long predating the Greeks, the sea-faring (thalasocracy) Minoans ( Interestingly another sea-faring civilization sprung up after this catastrophe, and are credited with gifting the Greeks and Roman our [phonetic alphabet]( we take for granted. &nbsp;I'm no where or anywhere near a qualified geologist, but when you have mainstream academics, claiming the [yonaguni monument]( is a "rock formation" you gotta follow the coincidences and come to more logical conclusions. If one has link or book, theorizing the effect of a second sun/large orbital body's geologic effect while being relatively close to earth it would be appreciated. When typing "What if jupiter was closer to earth" in search, I only get photoshops of jupiter in the night sky.
<|endoftext|>Most interesting to me about Sitchin is the idea that the Annunaki needed gold to spray in their atmosphere to protect them against global warming..He described Geo-Engineering / Chemtrails just with gold instead of aluminum in the 70s. Did the Sumerians really know about ancient extraterrestrial chemtrails? What does it mean for what we see in the sky today?It's all very weird to me.
<|endoftext|>Big fan of the Nebiru/Zecharia Sitchin theories (that's why I based my sci-fi series largely on them). What's amazing is all the parallels and coincidences you find between ancient cultures. Of course there are the big ones like the pyramids, the creation myths, the importance of snake symbolism. But there are also the smaller things like the commonality of twelve in ancient cultures: I don't know if this stuff is true, but it's fascinating to consider how it could all potentially fit together (which a lot of it seems to). And as a writer, it's allowed for a lot of fun world-building. 
<|endoftext|>This is the Hidden Hand perspective.Disclaimer:This was not written for you. This was written by an Illuminati insider, for other insiders who had questions. These insiders came from lots of different programs and projects within the structure and after leaving were finding out that they all had been lied to just as much as the rest of us. So questions were submitted, and this blog was written as the answers.Shane held many positions within "the Illuminati" where he was taught very much about their system. When he left, he started meeting others who had left programs and projects who were starting to realize that they each had been told their own version of the truth, and that none it was actually the truth. Shane started providing them with answers to questions. To make it easier, someone suggested he put up a blog. So the blog is written by a guy in the know, for others in the know. It was never meant to be public, but got discovered when he mentioned the Blue Avians once. And the rest is internet history.However, and I can't stress this enough, the blog was used as a teaching instrument. It has a start, a method, and an end. It is meant to be read from the beginning, in order, a step at a time. Like any learning course, you need to advance one concept at a time to understand the bigger implications and meanings. Calculus won't make much sense if you haven't taken algebra. Start at the beginning, read one entry, and let it soak in for a day or two. And don't skip the comments, they are just as insightful, if not more, than the entries themselves.A word of caution though, it's one of those things that can be pretty heavy on your mind and soul. So tread cautiously but purposefully down this path if you choose. There's no going back.From [The Ruiner Blog]( most confused name this writer knows.*As it has been presented to the public, this word simply means alien or extra terrestrial.Others believe that the Draco are in fact this race.*With a slight variant on the name,* the Annunaki, a race that created one of many versions of humanity, does indeed exist. Their story is much older than the most recent interpretations suggest. The most recent is a case of impersonation, by the Draco.Many elements of this translation are correct and many are incorrect, but the source material itself is a Draco creation.The word meaning "alien" has caused several races to address themselves as Annunaki when interacting with humans, confusing the name. A true race, with a very similar name, is being used as a model by the Draco.The true Annunaki race lives on Nibiru. The Draco do not. These Annunaki once created a human species utilizing an older hominid from earth, the Draco manipulated an already existing human species.Many have received contact with races who call themselves Annunaki and are then forced into arguments with people who know these translations as being a Draconian creation. This is unnecessary. The truth is in the middle.This is a race of humanoids who look like us in a larger size. They are benevolent but apathetic or self-centered and they check in on this planet often despite having no authority beyond that gifted to them by the Draco. (This is changing of course)They will have dealings with us again, as the transition sparks a brand new cycle.Their true name is connected to the planet they come from and is not entirely dissimilar to the impersonated name which has become known also as alien.*Names, names, names..*Annunaki is not their name truly, and other races besides them have called themselves this. The Draco used both their name - with a slight twist - and their image. One of many clever little mind fucks.The Draco have also completely erased the presence of some very close friends of the Annunaki.  Many older versions of humans also associate with them often.Apathetic? They are not cruel, very kind, but they do not meddle. They leave others to their own business, these days.They do seem to contact those of you who have had close encounters with the Draco, which shows a slight bit of willingness to push back and assist. Yet they also have made some terrible, although honest mistakes when interfering with other races, and therefor they take a slightly stand-off approach to most other planets.*~We often find acceptance of the names that our enemies give to us in this physical reality. Funny that.~*Nannun- Anu - Iunaki.. Annunaki.**Some more background*** Atlantis was a ship. An alien mother ship filled with many races that landed here very long ago, integrated with the humans here, and a city and then culture grew around the ship.* Enemies of these aliens eventually found them, and a terrible war broke out in this galaxy.* A large earth-like planet that was between Mars and Saturn was destroyed.* Earth as a planet was "reset" and the humans and alien refugees from the war continued to live here but under very difficult conditions for a long time.* It was in this traumatized state that the Draco arrived.* A deal was struck where they were given control in exchange for help. It was a trap, and is the root of our control system today.* The Draco Empire: At the top of them all is the King. Anu. He had many sons. Two are known to you surely, as Enki and Enlil.* The Draco are not very creative, but they are masters at borrowing other's stories and writing themselves into it. * The Draco have perverted all the ancient writings and materials we have. The Sumerian Tablets, the Ra material (Law of One), Ancient Egypt, The Emerald Tablets. You get the picture.* This doesn't mean we should disregard the materials. They have much truth in them, otherwise you wouldn't attached to them and the hook wouldn't work. It's good to explore all materials, just don't build a belief system out of any one.* Everything dealing with the Annunki took place even way before all of the above.
<|endoftext|>"Woke" is knowing you are the source of all existence. "You are the One, Neo." And then learning how to co-create your reality back to harmonic intervals instead of the disharmonic chaos you birthed yourself in. This is God's Video Game, where you are one of the many Avatars of Conciousness. We are just now learning how to *truly* and beneficially affect the quantum field/matrix. This matrix is not the "enemy", nothing is truly the "enemy" because we are all the same thing, playing on different "sides" of forces. This matrix has just been heavily minced with mis-truth and illusionary distractions, which are fun unti you hit a certain point, as humanity is now. We are transcending into a higher Octave of existence, where negatively-oriented, self-serving traits such as greed and manipulation etc can not exsist vibrationally. We are watching the transition now, just the beginning. How it plays out is directly up to you and your quantum assumtions of the future-presence. We are all the "ONE" so we each have our own "path", yet we all end up at the same spot: The SOUL seat. Sole, Sol, One, "Son/sun of God". You are that One., "Believing" =/= Knowing, which is why religions are a poor perversion of this truth. Placebo can not be manufactured. Faith cannot be "hoped for". You will know when you know. Decided to post this and see what resonates, or which belief systems I have offended, and how I can help fellow humans dissove their own personal prisons. We are different 'Cells' of the same existence. Can one (or a small majority of) braincell(s) cause a cascading effect on others in a beneficial, logical, and truthful way? Look up the 100th monkey effect and see how it pertains to human consciousness. On a small scale, It's like changing the plasticity of your brain, One group of braincells understands that starting a new, healthier habit will be better in the long run, but is faced with the overwhelming discomfort/pain of the other braincells that have to change/grow/adapt to the newer, healthier paradigm. Which is why habits are so hard to break and create. our human brain is a microcosm of our collective mind. Only need a few persistent braincells to start the domino effect on enlightenment, and the surrender of lower-logical structures/assumtions of reality, so they can be "washed away/transmuted" into "higher octaves/higher levels of order". Thus the "death" and "ressurection" of humanity.Just seeing what resonates, this is all I got for now. Thanks for reading 
<|endoftext|>I've long felt that instead of looking for "ancient astronauts," we should be looking for ancient humans.Any evidence I've seen for the former seems theoretically consistent with the latter, and an advanced collection of humans guiding the development of less advanced human societies seems far more likely than alien visitation.

He thought there was an advanced civilization before Sumer before the last big glacial melt in what is now the Persian Gulf and was accumulating funds to perform a shallow high resolution seismic survey in the Gulf to look for the ruins when he passed. He did not publish much of his material in this area because it was unfashionable amongst his colleagues. There is a small amount still on his preserved web site including this paper: [Shoreline reconstructions for the Persian Gulf since the last glacial maximum by Kurt Lambeck]( anybody knows of his students pursuing this work I would be very interested to see it.
<|endoftext|>Simplest research exposes Sitchin, just like Erik van Daniken, as Rockefeller stooges. I am disappointed in the inability of this sub to shake these poisoned theories off and see clearly. Is it so hard to see that the entire UFO agenda and alien origins of man are Hollywood driven? This crap will lead you nowhere at all. It only induces into your mind inferiority of humans, and this is the aim.
<|endoftext|>I have been hoping for this topic for a long time. Please read my user history. I have seen a black cube UFO. Zecharia Sitchin translates that the Archons or Annunaki, flew around in black cubes. I have seen a black cube UFO. If anyone ever sees one, please report it in my subreddit, r/BLACKCUBEUFO. Thanks!

I do not really believe in nibiru in the way we accept it. I'm thinking maybe a traveling ship , so large its considered a type of planet. Maybe, multi dimensional.

What I really wanna talk about is the first link in the list of round tables - the Archon nonsense, presumably written by the exact same people who hired Sitchin. You are currently living in virtual reality, or more precisely a consciousness-created construct. The Hindus call it "Maya." When the Bible tells you that the real world is Heaven, which I hope is obvious - again it's telling you that where you are now is all a test.There ARE no Archons - or, more accurately, YOU are the "Archons."You were created "In The Image Of God," meaning given the power to Create Reality.This is why so much effort is expended to fill you with fear, lust and greed - so that you generate negative reality.You have to realize that you are far more powerful than the people doing this to you. YOU are connected to God's Creative Force - YOUR power is INFINITE. THEY do not have it - which is why they have to resort to rituals and so forth.They fear the day you find out all this.I guess that day is now. :)By the way, you are now concluding Day 26 of the collapse of evil worldwide.More will be happening shortly.

<|endoftext|>I highly suggest the Earth Chronicles by Zecharia Sitchin. It's a great alternative source that can be used to compare to other sources. At the end of each Earth Chronicle book he comes to some fantastic conclusions.In the first book, the 12th Planet, he posits that their is a binary star in our system on a huge elliptical orbit. Those from this planet have enslaved and altered us for their mining operations. All fascinating stuff that he goes into great detail. In the second book, Stairway to Heaven, he discusses the story of Gilgamesh. How he believes he is part divine (alien) and wishes to return to the stars where they originate. It's a story about how Enkidu (an AI/Robot) and Gilgamesh make their way to a rocket ship and try to leave Earth.Wars of Gods and Men details many of the battles that took place between humans and their slavers. It goes into the drama between Marduk, Thoth, Enki and Enlil. Their lineages and the actions they took.The Lost Realms is fantastic. Sitchin says that Thoth left Egypt and came to start the Meso and South American Civilizations. Talks about the pyramids, alignments and their mythologies. He also lines up at the end of the book how there are two myths discussing the same event from two sides of the planet. In the Bible it is said there are 22 hours of day and in the Americas, it was night for 22 hours. He tries to pinpoint when this occurred and if it had anything to do with Niburu swinging by.So many more book in the series and so much more depth. It's a fantastic read and actually is where I started in my journey. I was trying to world-build a game/story and here I am almost twenty years later deep in the hole.
<|endoftext|>Nice, there is a lot of info (theories) in here (about niibiru and enki/enlil) and im sure some of it is true but just how much is there disinformation about this and why ? Is there a bigger secret behind all of this... i wonder what could it be.

<|endoftext|>"Anyhow, in the 1930s some anthropologists visited them and asked some questions, they got on the topic of astrology and were astounded at some of the things they heard. The dogon told the anthropologists about the Sirius cluster back when we thought it was just one star - - -"If I understand this part right, you suggest the modern science did not know about the cluster - or Sirius B - prior to 30's.Afaik: Sirius B's existence was anticipated by calculation 1844 (F. Bessel) and it was visually observed first time in 1863 (Alvan Clark). Thirty years later, in 1893, a group of French astronomers visited Dogon areas in Mali during their solar eclipse expedition that lasted more than a month."1930's some anthropologists" refer to works of Griaule and Dieterlen, who've seem to been unaware of the earlier expedition. In a oral culture of the Dogon, there have been 40-50 years of time to pass any information they possibly got from expedition team to next Dogon generations. Including, at the time, the latest astronomical information about the double nature of Sirius. IMHO: No doubt astronomy and Sirius were important for the Dogon culture. Perhaps because of this news of Sirius were welcomed and eagerly shared forward during the decades before Griaule and Dieterlen visits.In 1970's Griaule's and Dieterlen's works were re-popularized by Robert K. G. Temple who expressed the actual and initial claim about the extra-terrestial aspect. Something Griaule, nor Dieterlen never mentioned.Later there have been discussions about possible confusion Griaule and Dieterlen may have had, mainly concerning what actual stars the Dogon were referring to, Sirius or Venus or what. It is proposed that the oral heritage varies even amongst the Dogon people themselves.I did not write this in order to disturb your interesting discussion. Just wanted to enlighten the subject with another, perhaps more plausible, point of view. Hopefully you may build up a better theory on updated facts, something Temple so far never managed to do.
<|endoftext|>sacred symbols of the dogon is a great read, basically it describes how egyptian hieroglyphs contain references to string theory (dogon written language is similar to egyptian, but the difference is that the dogon still have an oral tradition whereby the esoteric meanings of the glyphs are explained, giving us insight into the deeper meaning of egyptian texts).
<|endoftext|>Great post. [Here's a link]( to one of Biglino's books translated into English if anyone is interested in reading. In it he translates the original Hebrew text literally into English, free of dogmatic or symbolic interpretations, which yields some very interesting results.

<|endoftext|>All of those bullet points can be countered by understanding orbits. It is absolutely impossible for a planet to orbit the Sun in such way that we can't see and be on a collision course with us. ?NASA going from 'Planet X is bullshit' - 'There might be a planet x' - `There is a planet x we just don't know where it is yet' - 'Our sun might have a binary twin'.This is just bullshit. NASA has not claimed anything remotely like this, except the first statement. Keep in mind that this does not take into account the fact that we can infer the existence of celestial bodies from their gravitational effects and nothing makes us think Planet X exists. This theory is about as mathematically sound as the Earth being flat. Grouping this "conspiracy" with the real deal only hurts the movement. That's why we should shy away from it. "The CIA is doing stuff behind our back" - good conspiracy. "A planet we never saw will hit us and destroy all civilisation" - bad conspiracy. Lastly, even if the planet exists, there is nothing we can do to prevent the end of the Earth. There is no need to panic now, when we can panic when we will actually see Planet X with our naked eye.

<|endoftext|>I always thought that saturn and Jupiter were planets ravaged by war. Saturn hit Jupiter with a weapon that drove deep into Jupiter's core, creating what we know as red eye and destroying all life on the planet at the same time by making the atmosphere unlivable. Jupiter on the other hand retaliated by hitting saturn with a weapon that vaporized its surface and unstablized it's gravity. This lead to debris floating out into orbit and forming the rings we see today.

Maldek. The destruction of that planet also caused the downfall of Mars which had it's own civilization at the time. 
<|endoftext|>Some researchers have suggested that the "monsters" depicted in ancient Sumer (and elsewhere) where actually genetic hybrids created during these experiments.The modern "pig" is also said to be created from combining wild boar and human DNA.
<|endoftext|>Side Question:There needs to be a distinction between interbreeding and genetic manipulation.By definition if two creatures can interbreed and have a viable offspring (which is not sterile i.e. mule) they are technically the same species. The term "extraterrestrial" means not of this earth, not necessarily alien. So in theory there could be humans who live their entire lives on other worlds. In this scenario the only leg up they ever had on us was knowledge / technology.Alternately if we could suppose that these "creators" were non human and used something more advanced than their cock & balls to genetically engineer humans. Then there is the added twist of not only engineering humans, but imbuing the humans with part of their own DNA spawning a new race like the The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Although this hybrid theory opens up another never ending blood chauvinism where people compete for who has the most dragon blood or wtvr.
<|endoftext|>The Pye video is *required*. Also it's fun to watch. The joke about Tyson is great. A pity his book isn't in print.
<|endoftext|>Ok so what ive been thinking through my research is we were created by a species and then visited numerous times afterwards by other species that had a hand in altering our DNA at different points in our history. Which would explain the periods of rapid brain growth in humans over different periods of time. Also what do you think about hollow earth theory and how the elites tie back to our alien origins? Idk I feel there is a possibility they are hiding in plain sight or maybe right under our noses. Or the theory that over time they had to interbreed with humans and maybe the annunaki at present are a shadow of their former strength idk you seem to know alot and id love to bounce some questions off ya
<|endoftext|>Are you talking about the elongated ancient Egyptian skulls? I just saw something showing how it was trendy to band skulls from birth to give them that shape. 
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the awesome link collection. Currently working my way through all of it.Can you elaborate a little bit ob the fused chromosome 2 aspect? The wiki page seems to be broken at the moment and I couldnt find anything interesting so far. 
<|endoftext|>That blog was a very interesting read! It's nuggets like that one that keep me wading through the sewer that is this sub :). Thanks man! 
<|endoftext|>Well that blog is a hell of a rabbit hole. I read the first ~70% of it including many comments (which I advise anyone considering to read it to check out, because they contain more writings from the author than the actual blog posts). I can't help but notice that he contradicts himself on something so fundamental that it discredits his entire story. So I find it hard to believe. Very interesting and enlightening nonetheless. He is either the GOAT whistleblower or a brutally sophisticated larper (or maybe just batshit crazy). 
<|endoftext|>Is this the same guy that posted on ATS for a few days a handful of years ago? It sounds like him, I'll dig into the blog now.
<|endoftext|>Im with you I love reading about this stuff. Happen to have any links to similar threads youve enjoyed?
<|endoftext|>Okay Im pretty deep reading this, does it ever change from him just talking about how much he hates Obama?
<|endoftext|>Glad someone said it. All this hype about aliens and technology is right on the tracks of The Great Deception. God bless!
<|endoftext|>I'm happy to find a counter argument but the few examples I've looked at on this site don't seem to properly refute Sitchin with any demonstrable authority.How do we know who's translation/interpretation is correct without being an expert in ancient languages?
<|endoftext|>Is it so hard to see that the entire UFO agenda and alien origins of man are Hollywood driven?Well, it's not that simple. Hollywood places real things or concepts into it's movies and disguises it as entertainment. On some level, they are trying to get people to think that alien origins are fantasy (by associating it with entertainment 1st and foremost). Alien origins are real but good luck piecing the story together. Most people are not capable of this.
<|endoftext|>THANK YOU! This really needed to be said. There are so many out there running around with false information and false beliefs due to questionable sources. Even the Annunaki themselves debunked Sitchin. &nbsp;The Gnostic stuff is pure garbage and I've seen how it's affected people. People love following and believing in fantasies because it's something for them to fight against. 
<|endoftext|>We were altered from fish state.We evolved from the fish state. Ancestor of humans were 3-4ft tall and lived either on the coast or in the water near the coast.
<|endoftext|>Definitely not adamantly opposed, I'm spiritual in my own way. But yeah ive seen the book of Enoch, there were other books removed from the bible by the Vatican. There is an overwhelming sense of manipulation, especially apparent when looking at how much the catholic church has to spend on lawyers to defend the pedos also ill definitely look into that book!
<|endoftext|>That would make sense seeing as how mauro translates pre Hebrew texts, because as he explains, most of the important events of the old testament occurred before Hebrew existed as a language. For example, Moses did not speak Hebrew because it did not exist at the time.
<|endoftext|>Zecheria Sitchin was into the occult.Have you guys seen this video concerning the validity of the Hyperlinked nature of the Bible and it's uncanny ability to predict world events hundreds of years in advance, including the birth, entry and death of Christ?Even though it was written over a period of 1500 years by over 40 people?Maybe we should pay attention to what it says...CHUCK MISSLER: Extra-Terrestrial Message
<|endoftext|>Just noticed that myself lol, this is the theory that has been interesting me the most. And I think you're right there's something here
<|endoftext|>Some historians believe that the hieroglyphs are more metaphorical than straight up this and that. For example a relief of the pharaoh catching birds with a net could be translated into the pharaoh catching his errant thoughts (bird's representing thoughtforms). Hieroglyphics are far more complicated than most think.
<|endoftext|>Just edited the link into my post, super interesting to watch! And you can tell he knows exactly what he's talking about
<|endoftext|>Yeah, true or not there is something to these nummo myths and ancient translations of texts. Like I said we won't know until we know, but I personally believe whatever we learn, humans have had a long interesting relationship with probably multiple different alien species and were most likely seeded on Earth by a race much more advanced then ours. It sure will be exciting to see what unfolds in this age of Aquarius! 
<|endoftext|>If you find this interesting watch this: is one of my all time favorites to watch. Clif High is an amazing person and has many opinions that have completely broadened my perspective
<|endoftext|>This is just bullshit. NASA has not claimed anything remotely like this 
<|endoftext|>Do you at all know what you're talking about? Have you seriously never heard of a highly eccentric Kepler orbit? Do you understand how comets work and why we only see them on specific time intervals?Do you seriously not read the news and see NASA saying there are gravity signatures of a large celestial object much larger than earth located outside of our solar system?You don't even seem to understand the basis of the stories of antiquity he mentions. Show me where they state that it actually collides with earth every X amount of years. They infer that it passes near us every X amount of years and that it's presence sparks geological events (ie; earthquakes, impact events caused by asteroids that pass through with it, etc....or in the Sumerian's case; visitation from the Annunaki)
<|endoftext|>I got that from his book, *Dark Matter, Exploding Planets & New Comets*...he completely revolutionizes our approach/understanding of gravity.It's an incredible book!
<|endoftext|>Van Flandern was a highly respected astronomer, and numerous discoveries are credited to him.What gives you the authority to be so dismissive of his work?
<|endoftext|>Ive also heard the pig thing. Which is alluded to when Christ sends the legion of demons into the pigs. 
<|endoftext|>I'm in a place where rodeo and 4H are still active, and I know lots of farmers who would laugh at that pig statement.But my perspective on human DNA manipulation after diving into this stuff for the last 20 years, and interest for ~30, leans more to stoned ape theory than this, though I like to read up on it. My personal feeling after spiritual exploration and psychonautic experimentation is that there are primal metaphors in all this Archon stuff that deal mainly in the inner struggle, metaphorically our "rise from the mud" or our exit from the cave. Celestial Mythos and the ever-expanding history of humans, Oannes and the Apkallu brotherhood spreading knowledge gathered over millennia by different groups - all that, and what we'll continue to find actual evidence of is where I place my "faith."
<|endoftext|>According to what Ive read it was both. Humans were first created from alien/primate gene splicing. We were created sterile but were given the ability to procreate some time later. *Side note: this is an alternative translation to original sin in the bible where Enki allowed for humans to breed when it was forbidden.*Once established as a species, the Annunaki took our women as mates creating a second new species, or supposedly the Nephalim.
<|endoftext|>I dont know anything about hollow earth, however Phillip Schneider claimed we have an existing subterranean alien species living here now in the Tall Greys. I dont know how much credence should be given there though. I think he was debunked as a liar. There are stories of Annunaki-human breeding though. Forgive me the source right now (probably somewhere in Sitchens writings), but the idea is supposed that Annunaki became attracted to our females, developed relationships, and bred with them. This is where the Nephalim supposedly came from. It even goes as far as claim that upon departure of earth humans were supposed to be eradicated with a great flood but an argument ensued and, with Enki as our greatest advocate, it was agreed to leave us alive.
<|endoftext|>The question would be 'why was it trendy' it could have been merely aesthetic with no other motive like chinese foot binding or it could have been a status thing based on an already existent class of people who had such a shape naturally. We know in more down to earth(heh) scenarios people absolutely do go to great lengths to alter their bodies and those of their children to more closely resemble more high status and powerful people in society. ie. the complicated history of hair straightening in the african american community and skin whitening in societies that came under colonial rule by white europoeans. I'm sure there are many other cases of people modifying their bodies to look more like colonizers or rulers for various reasons. 
<|endoftext|>The Peruvian elongated skulls have a larger cranial volume than we modern humans do as well as a different dental formulation from us, which are supposedly unique to each species. I'm on the trolley right now so i have no web, but i'll post links later.
<|endoftext|>All other primates have 24 pairs of chromosomes except for humans which have 23. Our chromosome 2 is a much larger, fused chromosome of two others which contains 242 million base pairs and 8% of our total DNA. Its argued that the fusing of chromosomes cannot occur naturally, and is an act of intelligent intervention. Theres a lot of debate about this though and its pretty complex. You basically need to be a geneticist to really understand it. I do my best to read both sides of the discussion but admittedly, Im way out of my depth when I start reading about telomeres and gene sequencing etc. 
<|endoftext|>Actually, the situation has changed recently.Here is a post I made once in response to a question asking why all the pedo stuff is coming out now. It explains some and link at the end for more.Tl:dr: Draco gone now, only Illuminati left, and they are fighting each other.A couple years ago the Draco empire left. They were running the shit and had many projects and programs setup to generate certain powerful human emotions because they used the energy it produced.Since they left many of those projects and programs shut down because there was no need for them anymore. This doesn't mean it has stopped, just lessened. But as a result, more and more of it is getting exposed. Its more complicated than just that, but you get the general idea.(Asked to elaborate...)Apparently, the Draco built the control system on this planet. The human elements of the structure is what we'd call the Illuminati or such. They're the minions that do the bidding, but it was always the Draco calling the shots.When the empire left, they handed over control to the Illuminati, who immediately began fighting each other in the power vacuum. You can see this playing out today with all the different factions of the Cabal fighting and exposing each other.So, they were harvesting our energy. The Illuminati were very much caught up in all that, but not so much getting the same benefits the Draco were. So when the empire left, there wasn't as much a need for it all. I don't think I need to describe it all, we're all very familiar with the sick shit that's been going on. So with those types of programs dissolving, the truth of what's been happening has started being used against certain factions. Also people trapped in that crap are more free now to come out than before.There's also another layer in between that really strange. They're called the parents, and they were the interface between the Draco and the Illuminati. They are mostly gone now too, but still a problem for us.I just posted a nice write up that describes more of what we can expect. Check it if you're interested. Feel free to ask questions.
<|endoftext|>So glad you're enjoying it. I think it's by far the greatest rabbit hole out there. The kinda thing that can affect your view on all the other rabbit holes.I've read it several times over the years and always find more connections and understanding of references or concepts I didn't get before. Good stuff.Can I ask what the contradition is you see? So few have read the blog it's hard to find people to talk with about it :)
<|endoftext|>Yes. But apparently not all reptilians are Draco though. I use to think the names were interchangeable but I guess its more nuanced.
<|endoftext|>No, not the same. And this is a different perspective and concept all together. He's not trying to disclose things to people like us, he's answering questions from people on the inside.Hope you find what you're looking for :)
<|endoftext|>Check out the nag hammadi codices. They contain the apocrypha (books removed from the bible) and more.. Including fantastic works like the hypostasis of the Archons and on the origins of the world. These are the texts of the Gnostics who as previously mentioned believe Yahweh to be a counterfeit mimic of a God. Check out "not in his inage" as well.. A wonderful write up on the Gnostics and their history.
<|endoftext|>Yeah, im not religious myself, but like you said im in touch with the spiritual side of things...The gnostic gospels from the Nag Hammadi library that were discovered this past century are another good example of religious texts that were censored. The Gospel of St Thomas is a really good one
<|endoftext|>It just means when they landed in the ocean they stayed there, and created a city. I don't believe they are fish gods. They wear fish like armor, or clothes, but not actually fish people. The annunaki look like much larger versions of you, and I.
<|endoftext|>Your view of Moses is incorrect friend. And I'm not sure how his earlier language experience would be an excuse for errors regarding Hebrew texts...
<|endoftext|>Is prophecy being fulfilled, or are powerful men manipulating world events to make it appear so? I think the later. The Templar sect in the masons are manufacturing the end of the world. Will you accept this end as god's return, (nothing we can do about it), or not fall for it ( and do something about it). 
<|endoftext|>There was a Star Trek, next generation like that. They met a race that spoke in metaphors. It was a weird one at first, but a brilliant one with multiple views.Battle of Tanagra. When the towers fell. Wow, it's been ages.
<|endoftext|>What is the Planet X conspiracy though? I thought it was something about it crashing into us in 2012. Do you guys believe the one NASA wrote about will crash into us? 
<|endoftext|>he completely revolutionizes our approach/understanding of gravity.Could you do a small summary? There are two leading theories in how gravity works and I haven't heard of a third one and would like to hear about it. 
<|endoftext|>Awesome, thanks for the info. I definitely think there's much more to this than meets the eye. Its like religion is made up of many half truths due to the masorets controlling the interpretation of the bible
<|endoftext|>You were right though, it can weigh pretty heavily. The claim the Ra material was another manipulation is probably the hardest thing for me to digest. Ive put a lot of stock in that one, I just don't see how any negative spin could outweigh the benefits that the Ra materials provides people with. I am also curious to see why the guy, and a few others, have a beef with the New Age movement, more specifically what they think it is doing to continue to illusion. It's a shame it was written a few years ago. On that note the odd predictions the guy made about 'the wave' haven't seemed to pan out with drops its credibility a bit.

<|endoftext|>Well one minor discrepency is when he talks about his background. He says he told his parent's about his "summer programming" at "his aunt's" house. They respond by accusing him of lying and saying he drove his aunt insane. His mother is a supposed ex-member of the 13 bloodlines. She is obviously in the know. Why would she treat him that way?The big contradiction though is when he talks about the universal law of free will (or whatever he calls it). The Draco's are not violating it because they recieved permission from earlier generations of mankind and also are informing us (subliminally?) about their plans through various means. Our passivity supposedely indicates consent. Unfortunately no one besides us have the right to stop them. Their violations of free will and natural laws are handled by the universe not a galactic police force or legal system. In those courts what they are doing with this planet would be considered frowned upon but still technically legal.So they are supposedly not violating our free will. But he says one (or more) of the life extension methods used by the parent's involves babies. He doesn't state what they do with them but one would assume they are taking their blood and/or harvesting energy from them. Whatever they do to the babies I can't imagine how a baby could consent to this. Passivity doesn't really indicate consent when it comes to babies. In fact it's reasonable to say that if a baby starts to cry when you do your business with it, that would mean you are violating its free will. It has no other way to communicate its unwillingness to participate.He also says he was offered a job to telepathically influence people's actions. How is that not a violation of free will?How is MK Ultra mind control programs not a violation of free will? Even if consent is given at the beginning of the process, one would imagine that intense torture would cause the affected person to beg for it to stop. At which point free will is violated if the torture is continued.Also I don't see how one being could give consent for the actions performed against another, even if our social and legal norms tell us that's the case (e.g. parents, ancestors, legal guardians). I'm sure there are more discrepencies regarding free will (and perhaps regarding other things as well) but none come to mind right now . I would have to give the material a second reading. Perhaps my understanding of the actual mechanics of free will is just flawed but I can't see how any of these things don't violate free will.
<|endoftext|>Hmmm interesting. I guess like Humanoid, Reptoid or Reptilian can just be another category that extends throughout different civilizations that isn't limited to one specific one.
<|endoftext|>Wonderfully, actually...It's a little hard to explain - I've found my research synchronicities point in this direction... not to say that ALL Egyptians, Canaanites, Basque, etc were aliens/survivors. Just the leaders who raised them out of the darkness, so to speak.Truly it looks like a sea-faring network of cities world wide collapsed in a flood and those less civilized or uncontacted peoples before who lost everything and were forced inland, made these more advanced people (giants?) their first kings and gods... but it's literally always those same civilizations and peoples coming up...
<|endoftext|>I'll second the Pnutmaster comment. Basque, Berbers, and Gaels are Atlantean refugees. Blond/Red -haired, fair skinned, blue eyes and using a language that has no Indo-Euro roots.Wondering the connection between Tuatha De Danann and the Gaels.Interesting the presence of "Dan" in that word (Lost tribe of Dan).
<|endoftext|>Ive heard of the Gnostic gospels before but ill have to look into them much deeper now, thanks for the further reading material!
<|endoftext|>It's kind of like not having punctuation, you can read what it says, but there is no possible way to know exactly what happened without that punctuation.When you translate between twoblanguages, there are sometimes words that don't directly translate. Germans might have one word to convey an aversion to socialization, where as in english, it would be the name of some behavioral disorder. It would also convey a label, rather than a meaning.Language is pretty cool, and incredibly complex when you start moving between them.
<|endoftext|>"To do this justice, we have to understand that the Hebrew language was passed on as cononants, and they have no idea what vowels were inserted.Vowels are the meaning. They give meaning to the sentence, paragraph, and in order to know this Hebrew would have had to exist at the time.At the time of Moses, Hebrew did not exist as a language and all scholars/academics know that.So, the bible is not an accurate thing, but is actually someone's opinion. The opinion of a certain powerful family took precedence over everyone else's. Of course that family was located in the Holy Land because coordination was going to have to take place between religions to some extent.There are words where up to 70 meanings could be ascertained depending on the vowels."
<|endoftext|>God Uses Men for his ends like he did Cyrus, Nebuchanezzar, Hitler.Also, Ezekiel 38 has yet to happen, and while Damascus is a ruinous heap, looks to me like it hasn't become "desolate" yet. (Isaiah 17:1)Remember, the ones pulling the strings behind the scenes will usher in and worship an apostate conqueror as their new leader of religion & world government.For me, nothing more makes sense, considering this is all a war on God & Jesus Christ, an attempt to rewrite history.The longest Con in human history, perpetuated by the same people; and worse...the Fallen Angel known as Lucifer/Satan. Verse reference for Burden of Damascus.
<|endoftext|>It's kind of both. Astronomers around the world keep finding evidence of another planetary body that interacts with our solar system, even NASA admits it's there. The conspiracy part comes into it because the more you read into our ancient history, the more indications there are that periodically our planet is affected by other celestial bodies to a cataclysmic degree. This knowledge is hidden from people for the reason of various adgendas. As a side note, it may not hit us but the magnetic effects of celestial bodies passing close to one another means huge geological turmoil on the surface of our world. 
<|endoftext|>Google chemtrails and Nibiru.Do you really think they would tell us??Not until the wealthy and powerful are safely hidden in their doomsday bunkers! Why would they tell us? They would rather cover our planet with "clouds" and fog until the last possible minute....
<|endoftext|> Do you guys believe the one NASA wrote about will crash into us?There are no "you guys". Just a bunch of randos like you and me alongside several hundred bots. 
<|endoftext|>Wasn't it the sumerians that wrote that the planet is full of creatures that come to harvest humans when the planet comes near? A culling would reset the world, giving it 10000 years to build up again for the next orbit.
<|endoftext|>Just heard of this, but I guess it stands to reason a big enough planet with an orbit like that could bring some dangerous friends along for the journey 
<|endoftext|>2 main theories of gravity: 1) Masses exert a pulling force on other masses and move toward each because of this force (Newton) 2) Masses exert a "deforming" force on spacetime and other masses are caused to move by this deformed spacetime (Einstein)
<|endoftext|>Nope...on the fence about Sitchin personally, but I do appreciate his work and how it's fueled great discussions like this.If you want a more scientific approach to this topic, I highly recommend *Dark Matter, Missing Planets & New Comets* by astronomer Tom Van Flandern.Fascinating stuff!
<|endoftext|>If you figure out the vectors and momentum of an object in a frictionless environment, you can quite easily project where its heading and also reverse the clock to see where it's been. Rewind 2 million years and they end up in the same spot. Strange?What's hard about that to understand? 
<|endoftext|>I think so. I think the modern religions are books translated from cruciform and Hebrew, which were translated from Aramaic, which were translated from the first stone carvings, which told the story of aliens landing on earth and creating mankind. The repeated misinterpretation has lead us to a story of a god in heaven when its original meaning was probably something like, visitors from the stars. The best example of this that I can give is how Sumerians depicted gods. Their symbol for gods (plural) was that of a flying, hovering thing, similar to a gliding bird which flew but did so specifically without flapping its wings. This was interpreted in Hebrew as the word spirits, which we translate today as the word god (singular). Hovering, flying thing = Spirits = God (or some variation of that). I must stress, Im no expert and I have no source on this. These are just my personal thoughts. 
<|endoftext|>I definitely think there's much more to this than meets the eye. Its like religion is made up of many half truths due to the masorets controlling the interpretation of the bibleLet me know what you think about these 2 videos. Both nice and short enough. I think you'll enjoy!
<|endoftext|>Yeah, I hear ya. He had a good quote once in an interview where he said, "The truth shall set you free, but first it'll piss you off."It is quite the rollercoaster. In regards to all our materials being corrupted, he's made the remarks more than once about not throwing out the baby with the bathwater. He understands well that its difficult to come to grips and made sure to emphasis that lots of truth is still in those materials. Focus more on the concepts and less on the details, that's where they mostly muddy the waters. I don't know the Ra material other than the lectures I've heard or stuff from Wilcock, so I can't comment much about it. Just be wary of any parts that have you giving you power to someone else or putting others above you. Mostly they would twist things in way where you end up relying too much on another authority or getting constricted into closing out other ideas or beliefs.Which is mostly where concerns about the new age stuff come in.  It can be trouble if people are waiting for some higher power, aliens, or spirit, or whatevs to change things or fix things for them. The new age type stuff where arch Angeles are coming "soon" to enlighten us or ascend us or were gonna go to 5d, just you wait, no need to do anything, just wait. I know that's a terrible generalization, but you get the idea.Funny, kinda sounds like his "wave" talk.Although, I do wonder a lot if all the craziness happening in the world now has to do with it. I don't know, but I think about it a lot.Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts. Its great to have others to discuss this with.
<|endoftext|>So, I'd like to add a piece to the 'free will pie' as it were. There's the idea that, there exist multiple levels of reality above us and that there's actually an elaborate pre-incarnation process that goes on before a soul actually ends up incarnated. This is where the really nasty alleged free will twist is said to happen and actually, if even remotely true, gives us the association of devils with contracts and even the very concept of souls being stolen.Basically, the idea would be that in order to incarnate on a planet you have to make an agreement with whoever rules that planet on the level that oversees such decisions. The entities in charge of earth, being general assholes have a particularly nasty setup in the contracts they require of souls that want to drop in and spend some time on our lovely sphere. The biggest one, however is the one having to do with memory. Basically, everyone or almost everyone 'agrees' prior to reincarnation to have their memory wiped and lose all knowledge of all prior existence or history and conscious knowledge of any pre-existing agreements that have been made this is coupled with a bunch of other agreements that involve 'agreeing' to being subject to the risk of free will violations while physically incarnated. So, that right there allows a tremendous amount of leeway with what's done to people down on the surface because they 'agreed' to a whole bunch of ball and chain clauses that limit them without even knowing about it. 'The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he doesn't exist' if you will. Allegedly, that by itself isn't really enough to for some of the nastier free will violations, but the next part involves tricking or convincing people to do things actually 'of their own free will' so that the authorities upstairs can point to those actions in order to get permission to do what would otherwise be 'against the law'. Then there's the really wild idea of soul capture following death. So everyone's memory is wiped prior to incarnation and then all their life they're indoctrinated and programmed into false belief systems, when they die they end up in a situation that most aren't prepared for and things show up and try to trick them into agreeing to things they really shouldn't be agreeing to. Apparently, there's a whole process for retrieving all past memories etc. and people get caught before they can do it, fed a bunch of bullshit about karmic debt etc. and convinced to agree to reincarnate with all that that entails. You end up with a weird recycling system where people aren't ever actually able to comprehend what's going on because they've been denied access to the full picture and an elaborate system of smoke and mirrors has been erected to trick them into agreeing to things they shouldn't agree to. Since this all technically started with free will agreements in the first place, the nasty tricks are allowed because the nasty tricks where agreed to at least in principle.Of course you also have weird ideas like people actually being multidimensional entities where parts of them exist outside of time as we understand it, so under that framework the person down here on earth or even a newly disincarnated soul might very well just be a tiny fraction of a larger personal structure that primarily exists outside of the weird shenanigans alleged to be going on down here on earth with earth as some sort of really really fucked up game that's a bit of a puzzle to resolve from the higher points of view, but a game none the less.
<|endoftext|>Well said my friend. I think it would be great if all peoples and non-peoples read your statements about free will.I spent a lot of time pondering this concept too, not sure I understanding it any better yet. But my feelings on the matter are right in line with your comments. As for the author of the blog, Shane, he feels the same as you do. That what the Draco were doing is a violation of free will, and in many ways, just like you pointed out. This is why he could never fit in with any of their programs and projects. It's why he got moved around so much and was given the moniker "the ruiner". His conscience always got in the way. From what I've gathered listening to his interviews after, it seems nobody "out there" was really aware of the details. The "legal" aspects of it were similar to how we have a House and Congress and Judicial system, but behind that is a sinister and hidden force always doing dirty deeds in the dark.It seems recently at lot more attention has been focused on our planet and I've heard him speculate with others that it might even be part of the reason the Draco left, because word was getting out of what they were really doing.As far a Shane's family, I also can't imagine his mother wouldn't understand what was happening.

<|endoftext|>I've read Sitchin's work, but it's been a while...but basically that the highly eccentric kepler orbit of planet X allows them to visit earth on a time interval and that all sorts of shit has gone down when they do so. They essentially had engineered/created humans as robots/slaves to mine for them at one point.The 'culling' i think is mostly tales of impact events and floods that coincide with planet X, which now mainstream science admits there is evidence of periodic flooding that triggers mini ice ages, likely from impact events.

<|endoftext|>Not everything is a trick. You're supposed to incarnate without any memory. That's what gives life meaning. The true trick is influencing the newly incarnated with making the wrong choices. That's why a lot of this revolves around the media, entertainment industry and so on. 
<|endoftext|>Truthfully, a lot of it relates to the proto-basque cultures and how they intertwine with similar civilzations around the same time.There has been a LOT of forgery regarding Proto-Basque digs... and just, the name shows up so often in my research but I haven't spent a lot of time on it yet. I should do that :\For example, I was going to not post this yet and went back to the article I was reading and came across this in it:"Genetic DNA analysis can trace the ethnic tribal lineage, and thereby land of the origin, of a human being. Native American tribes contain four distinct DNA groupings, designated A, B, C and D. These groupings are found in Asia but not in Europe or Africa. While 96 percent of all indigenous natives in North and South America fall within A, B, C and D, there was a mysterious four percent, dubbed Group X, which could not be explained.Type X subjects were not found in the vast majority of tribes, including none in South America. It was also determined Type X subjects arrived in North America 10,000 to 38,000 years ago, later than the other groups. By far, the highest concentration of Type X in Europe was found in the Basques, a race of Caucasians who live in the Pyrenees Mountains between Spain and France. And the highest frequency of Type X in the entire world was found in the Berbers, a race of Caucasians who live in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco in North Africa. The Basques and Berbers have long puzzled anthropologists, linguists and historians because they dont seem to fit into their continental surroundings.nephilim3However, independent researchers of the Association of Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.), followers of Edgar Cayce, have come forward and made a few observations of their own. Known as the Sleeping Prophet, Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) is considered by many to have been Americas foremost psychic. Throughout his lifetime he performed over 14,000 readings while in a self-induced trance. Although delving into many subjects, 8,976 of his readings, transcribed onto 900,000 pages of notes, were devoted to medical problems, a majority of which were resolved, often advancing current medical technology." follow the waves of the universe, that is how you hear the real God of all and thus, find truth.You just taught me as much as I taught you ;)
<|endoftext|>Fair point. One thing I have noticed, up here in Canada, is that the geoengineering sprays are usually deployed near cities, toward the sun, at sunrise and sunset. Seems suspicious to me. Why near cities, and why target the rising and setting sun?I believe 100% that chemtrails are to prevent us from seeing anomalies and thus our panic. Also, the sun's azimuth has been off for years. Sun rising and setting too far north or south. They can't hide this with their silly sprays. How classy of them.
<|endoftext|> Lizard people/demons/planets crashing into us seems like too much.Welcome to the internet. How long have you been around?
<|endoftext|>tbh, it sounds far stretched, but not to crazy when you begin to read the bible and gnostic texts. I was never religious, but the more I read these old texts, I understand where all these theories are coming from that deal with the supernatural, aliens, lizards and soul trap things.

<|endoftext|>Basic idea is that it used to be a paradise and people came here all the time for tons of reasons, then new management took over and no one new came here except for the very stupid and the very brave. The few who managed to figure out a way to get out even from under the veil of ignorance probably weren't particularly keen on coming back given the risks.Supposedly, there are also people who come in given the risks because they're part of an effort to weaken the system and assist in changing management. Presumably, things like Bodhisattva would be the types of entities that would drop in despite circumstances.
<|endoftext|>I think you're right, but a. there's degrees of possible loss of memory. You can imagine a situation where the loss of memory is less profound than ours is and b. you can see how if such a process isn't explicitly put on lockdown to prevent meddling it could be hijacked. You can have a hypothetical situation where the re-incarnation rules are different for different domains and ruled by different interpretations of whatever universal law is the overriding determinant of what is and isn't allowable. The fact that we're stuck down here in ignorance makes us easy pickings for anyone who knows more of the big picture than us and is interested in hindering the rate at which we discover it either way.Also, there's like a thousand narratives and counter narratives so I was just sharing one wild one I'm fond of because it makes things even weirder than the trite we incarnate here because we want to be here one, which is technically true if free will is a thing, but figuring out how free will could be twisted into something decidedly un-free is an interesting thought experiment, at least for me.
<|endoftext|>So you mean reading religious text lends credibility to these theories? Or just understand where the mindset comes from? Where do these texts get their information from?
<|endoftext|>So how exactly does the fact that the population has gone from 1 billion to almost 8 billion in ~130 years fit into this equation?
<|endoftext|> So you mean reading religious text lends credibility to these theories?If the premise is "everything in the bible etc. is real, not fiction" then, yes! I'm still not religious and a believer, just to make that clear, my argument has nothing to do with my own beliefs.
<|endoftext|>"The Fellowship has been described as one of the most politically well-connected ministries in the United States. The Fellowship shuns publicity and its members share a vow of secrecy.[8] The Fellowship's leader Doug Coe and others have explained the organization's desire for secrecy by citing biblical admonitions against public displays of good works, insisting they would not be able to tackle diplomatically sensitive missions if they drew public attention." group is the actual power in the Executive Branch right now, not Trump. Understand "The Fellowship Foundation" and you will understand the current White House. Some reading:[One of the earlier mainstream media investigative pieces on the group]( excerpt from Jeff Sharlet's book about the group's relationship with Somalian dictator, Siad Barre]( a bipartisan group, Hillary Clinton called the group's leader, Doug Coe, her spiritual mentor.]( more, but the media generally doesn't talk about the group outside of liberal media talking about Fellowship/Republican sex scandals.

<|endoftext|>A meaningful and complete contribution to this subject will be tricky and long and there will (always be) naysayers and detractors, so let's dive right on in: (hmm, where to begin...)Let us take a look at the distribution of a [little possessed DNA grouping, called Haplogroup X]( The Eastern Band of Cherokee have, for some time now, insisted upon Middle Eastern ancestry and though testing of THEIR people yielded low percentages, so did testing in the current middle east.It is as if, a sea-faring race of original Canaanites was in the Middle East prior to everyone else who lives there now and they came or moved to America and are now almost extinct... hmm... curious.[What do their legends tell us of their origins then?]( hmm I see... 23 tribes, some of the largest ones - all insist upon giants inhabiting this land before them... well that's okay, *pre-historic man was stupid, yep they were dumbbbbb...they thought the enemy was a cool guy so they painted petroglyphs of them as 15 feet tall and eating all their people. Yup.. they were dumb..*Or and lets be honest here... do you really think pre-historic man knew nothing of truth or importance and everything he told us of his life was a lie?So if we are WILLING to consider that there may be some veracity to these legends, let's look at the overall picture of what we find in America, to begin to build a case.Well, the most prominent and common feature we find are [hundreds and hundreds of burial mounds]( Yet some of these mounds are too large for just burials - in the case of [Monk's Mound]( the base of the structure is almost equal to the footprint of the Great Pyramid. In the case of [Poverty Point]( we find a city built atop/between/around the mound site. (As an interesting note, that we will get to later: some of these burial mounds show intense weathering and deposition of sea-based minerals and markers. Some are also in the middle of rivers, swamps, lakes - remembering of course two things:1) Climate, geography and the shape of the land change over time2) Pre-historic people were NOT stupid. (I always ask people "Why build a sunken city... no one would do that in a time where very survival was your own responsibility... it SANK... people are SO brainwashed into non-rational thinking these days it's almost sickening.)These geological changes seem to imply a different landscape at the time of their building. Now some can be explained as plains that became swamps a few hundred or thousand years ago, fine.In the case of [Lovelock Cave's Duck Decoys]( the last time the area had any meaningful body of water to fish from was [12,700 years ago]( Not to mention they were dug from a strata of soil dating between 10,000 to 15,000 years. The Paiute natives of this area tell of their army chasing the last of the Giants into the cave, setting the entrance aflame and firing thousands of arrows into the cave. From the cave, beneath layers of bat guano were found burnt brush, many arrowheads and a strange donut shaped stone with 365 notches carved on the outside ring. Evidently an 8 foot 6 inch skeleton was found under the guano by the Paiutes but they buried it and refuse to reveal the location - because they claim the Giants are their ancestors!!!! Curiouser and curiouser. The reason for the war was apparently that after having taught the Paiute and protected them, they began to devour them? (World wide claims hold that there may have been two races of giants: red haired, friendly ones and black haired cannibalistic ones.) In prolonged sun exposure, very dark hair can attain a ruddy, rust colour. Perhaps they mistook one for the other and paid for it in blood?In an attempt to gain extra information from the Paiutes, (one researcher was extorted for at least four figures, just to film [Pyramid Lake]( The Pyramid Lake [petroglyphs]( were determined to be between 10,000 and 15,000 years old. It becomes slowly clear there is some kind of gate-keeping occurring here.Even the strict religion of science cannot fully accept the [Baring Strait Crossing Hypothesis]( saying and I quote: "There exists a number of theories for pre-Columbian trans-oceanic migrations into the Americas."To counter the scientific ineptitude of this theory, the [Kelp Crossing Hypothesis]( has been suggested. "In the Perspective, Erlandson and his colleagues argue that early Americans followed Pacific Rim shorelines from northern Asia to Beringia to the Americas, then continued to migrate through the Americas along the coasts  not through the ice-free corridor that the Clovis-first theory suggests."If you return to the map of the mounds, however and the distribution of Haplogroup X. **The conspiracy is: the wrong sea-board and the wrong people at the wrong time!**Though my explanation has been MUCH simplified (I could write DAYS worth of the evidence I have discovered and how it all webs together to support this, but no one wants that.) I believe the GENERAL idea is becoming clear.A respected red-haired race of stature, ORIGINALLY From the middle-east and nearly completely unrelated to those who live there now... mound-builders who lived BEFORE AND AFTER a world-wide flood, hm... where have I heard that before...?I hope you enjoyed my (again) **GROSSLY OVER-SIMPLIFIED** (due to time and space and attention constraints) (and the fact this is the first time I have tried to articulate the WHOLE idea in one breath) explanation of why I love the topic of Ancient America.**BONUS** If you got this far you deserve a treat. So here you have it, in good old Q fashion:Did the Natives ARRIVE and find people already here or were they the children of the original inhabitants?Why did Hitler call the Native Americans "Honorary Aryans"?Why did he go berserk when he began to excavate in the Middle East?What museum exhibit was Saddam planning to open?What famous leader, hated by the current rulers of the world did Saddam call/have himself painted (literally) as?What was taken from the Iraq National Museum?When the war begins, I know EVERYONE is gonna break into the museum, go past the on-display fakes, blow the hinges off the vaults and steal the real artifacts.

<|endoftext|>Anyone know the obsession with death and rebirth in freemasonry or other societies? Is this something an initiate must undergo, at a certain degree? Something where you are physically put to sleep and awaken after 3 days, or something along these lines?If the great pyramids were not actually just burial chambers for kings, but actually temples for initiation, I can understand why there are constant mentions of tombs. Initiates were put to sleep and "reborn" upon awakening. I listen to a lot of rap music, especially the older stuff (90s to mid 2000s), and as a genre rap is very anti-occult and anti-secret society. Constant subtle mentions of occult beliefs and worship. The thing is you have to know those beliefs beforehand to catch on. They always seem to mention sleep, usually claiming they never sleep. They usually reference the classic nas line of "I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death". This implies they would never join and undego such a ritual. I've heard this numerous times. Jadakiss and styles P on the track "banned from TV". Cam'ron has the verse before these two where he says "Rich faces, sick places. See my story is 6 thousand, 6 hundred and 66 pages". Then jadakiss and styles P have lines shortly after saying "do they dance with the devil when they sleep?", as well as "it's the shit that they kick in your ear, when your soul drift in the air". There are many more.Any ideas?

Here are some things that come to mind and that all have to do with the topic of mystery schools and the development of one's deeper aspects through them.  This has always been an interesting video to check out regarding Freemasonry and mystery schools. The man speaking is one of the past grand commanders of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. It is interesting about how he goes into the idea that we have untapped powers sleeping within us and that these ancient mystery schools helped the individual bring forth these faculties through their own inner development:Part 1-  2-  here is a neat video with a man named Elmer Green and he was a scientist who was working with people in training them how to control autonomic functions of the body with their minds and their imagination, and he also tested several yogis of India with scientific equipment he designed with the help of the team he had: excerpt is taken from Beyond Biofeedback by Elmer & Alyce Green, 1977 Knoll Publishing Co., Chapter II: Self-regulation: East and West, pp. 197  218: anyone here know about Franz Bardon ? He was a Czech occultist with an interesting background and story. A bit of a biography of the man that was written in part by his secretary. Some say it is not an accurate depiction of the man due to embellishments by the secretary, but the story is interesting and touches on the idea of secret societies with members who have extensively developed mental abilities and use them for either "good" or "bad" depending on their own natures: a lot more where that came from but its late.

<|endoftext|>There is a passage apocrypha, 2 Esdras 13:40-47 that many believe refers to the lost tribes crossing the Bering Strait into North America:"these are the ten tribes that were taken captive from their land in the days of King Hoshea, whom King Shalmaneser of the Assyrians took across the river as a captive. They were taken into another land, but they made this plan for themselves: They would leave the multitude of the nations and go into a more remote region, where the human race had never lived. There they would be able to observe their customs, which they hadnt kept in their own region. They went in through the narrow passages of the Euphrates River. Then the Most High gave them signs and stopped the flow of the river until they had passed. They made a long journey through that region for a year and a half, and that region is called Arzareth. They lived there until the last time, and now they begin again to return. The Most High will once again stop the flow of the river so that they can cross."Legends say this was one of the sources that led Columbus to look for the New World.

<|endoftext|>This makes me think of the Book of Mormon. Very interesting considering Joseph Smith's alleged ties to freemasonry."The books from First Nephi to Omni are described as being from "the small plates of Nephi".[51] This account begins in ancient Jerusalem around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named Lehi, his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the Babylonians in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the Arabian peninsula, and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship." Mosiah 1 discovered a people who had left Jerusalem with mulek, a son of Zedekiah (see Jer. 52:10; Omni 1:12-15; Hel. 8:21), and King Limhi's messengers found a record of the extinct jaredites, the Nephites learned that they were not the only people God had brought to the Western Hemisphere. to the Book of Mormon, the people fled across the ocean on unique barges and established an ancient civilization in the Americas. The book of Ether's mention of "elephants" and "narrow neck of land" has led some to conclude that this civilization likely spanned from the Midwest to eastern states such as New York, where not only fossils of ancient mammoths have been discovered in abundance, but in many Native American accounts describe Niagara as the narrow strip of land which literally translates to "the neck" [reference?]

<|endoftext|>Since when is 8 feet considered a separate species of giant? There have been verified cases of humans with that height. I thought when people here talk about ancient giants they meant 20 foot tall like Gilgamesh. 
<|endoftext|>I like to keep my mind open to everything but thats a lot to wrap your head around. That being said, your red haired and black haired giants theory intrigues me.Since it's semi relevant, have you ever looked into the "lore" behind the book of Mormon? The book was supposedly translated in a John Dee fashion by treasure Hunter and Freemason Joseph smith in the early 1800s. The book is a history of ancient americans who came from Israel and colonised Central America (debatable). The original ancestor of these people, Nephi, is always described as "large in stature", and his bloodline eventually is whiped out by another tribe.Obviously, a lot of the book has been debunked by anyone not brainwashed by the current church authorities (see precolumbian horses/wheat/steel). But maybe Smith was on to something? It's not far fetched to believe he was into the occult, so it could be possible. He was also obsessed with ancient egypt, and tried to translate some burial scrolls but failed miserably according to modern interpretations.

<|endoftext|>Your comment about the pyramids spurred a thought in my head. I've read a theory about the pyramids being used as devices that could project the consciousness of an individual out into the universe/to another planet. Couple this with the records of supposed ancient pharaohs who ruled for tens of thousands of years... What if Egyptian rulers were projecting consciousness of themselves at death into the mind of their heir at their inheritance of the throne? That'd effectively have an "individual" ruling for hundreds of years. 
<|endoftext|>rap is very anti-occult and anti-secret society. Going to have to disagree with you on this one, especially regarding rappers today.There's a rapper named Xxxtentacion, who came up with a rapper named Ski Mask the Slump God. They had issues with each other, and Ski Mask claims that X said that Ski was "supposed to be sacrificed". A pornstar friend of theirs (not a very reliable source, I know) said that X "sacrificed X's soul".Then you have Lil Uzi Vert who is constantly playing off occult themes. Although I think this is a stretch, people have pointed out how much his name sounds like Lucifer. On his recent album (and really first major release) Luv is Rage 2 he has a song called 444+222. [This]( is the default cover for the album, but he also released the version [without the Off White tape on it.]( You can see all sorts of symbolic imagery that was previously covered, such as a goat head, a snake intertwined in arrows, and a halo above his bear backpack. Furthermore, he's shown depicted with bat wings on the corners. This isn't the extent of Lil Uzi's use of occult symbolism, but rather just a look at the uses of it on this album. Another example is the rapper Z-Ro who recently retired. His final album called "No Love Boulevard" has a song called "Devil In Me". Here are some relevant excerpts.   If I woulda signed that contract, I'd be richer than rich  But when they say die, I'd have to die face down in that ditch  (Everybody wanna try, to bring out the devil in me  What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D)  If I attended that ceremony, I'd be better off  Find myself a celebrity, but I'd be forever lost  (Everybody wanna try, to bring out the devil in me  What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D)    What good is it for me, to gain the world but yet lose my soul  I woulda been a millionaire, since 20 years old  I wouldn't have had to pay, for all of these diamonds and gold  Just sacrifice one of my people, I ain't really knowThere's a lot more to take from [these lyrics]( but these few excerpts show him referencing shady record deals with something more to them.Finally, my last example will just be a [link to a post]( I've made in the past which shows what I believe to be (alleged) use of blackmail in the music industry (although could be explained as just some odd sexual thing). I wouldn't say any of these examples prove that rappers are involved in this type of thing, but it at the very least shows how often it is that rappers like to reference it.

<|endoftext|>Transcripts:
<|endoftext|>Listening to this was an extremely formative experience for me when I first started conspiracying over a decade ago...thanks for the link!(and happy cake day!)
<|endoftext|>I hear that the teachings and traditions are pristine but the lodges today are infested with pedos and power mongors
<|endoftext|>I was thinking a lot could be bots but maybe it's a mixture of both. The ones who have long conversations are the ones who are masons. While the bots are the ones with a single comment and never replies. Just a idea.
<|endoftext|>Most shills are just low level Masons trying to work their way up the ladder of initiation. They also don't get paid and are doing it as part of their dues to the lodge.
<|endoftext|>Part of Ben Franklin's intelligence network. Chapter 10 of [How the Nation was Won]( explains how Franklin infiltrated the aristocratic and secret societies of Europe to buddy up to the elites. This was a cover for the American Revolution which was supposed to be like all the other controlled-opposition jobs, but ended up being a true revolution because it was planned out decades in advance.
<|endoftext|>There's a profound connection between groups like this, the American Revolution, and even the Bavarian Illuminati (all had their origins in 1776).In fact, the first state to declare Independence (Rhode Island I believe?) did so *days* after the Bavarian Illuminati was founded.Also, the history of the Revolutionary War is woefully incomplete without studying Freemasonry.The book *The Temple and the Lodge* by Baigent and Leigh reveals some fascinating tidbits about cooperation between Freemasons in *both* the British and American forces, especially the officers.
<|endoftext|>And low, the Sage sitting under the great seething Oak whispered his first lesson to the masses. I invoke the great power of the goddess of poetry. Speak in me muse, through my tongue speak. Tell of truths yet unknown, unveil the. And the words of the goddess rang through the sage. No longer a man. Now a vessel. Gaze unto thy navel no more. Look up into the world. We have entered upon the last age of man. The Kali Yuga. The iron age. Nothing is sacred in the last age. The age of the material girl and the death of the goddess. The age where only material things have value. Our ancestors once held notions to the level of gods. Justice, Victory, Courage, Death, and Love, all gods. Or held the the level there of. Gods in the sense that they are above man. We no longer have any gods in this age. Just the false idol of the dollar. Apotheosis of the lowest cast. The money making merchant. Shunned are the true priests, the bards. Sunned are the courageous, the warrior the protector. Nothing is sacred under the rein of those who rule by usury. Not, divine right of victory.Upon the mad presumption of Nietzsche, God hath died. Mad at the time but after the horrors of the last century we can see that in the abyss we are alone. He said that if you stare into the abyss of reality long enough the abyss will stare back into you. And that is why we are all gathered here in this sacred grove. We contemplate the death of god. The rotten body of god withered from the cross. Now a century on even the cross does rot. Buzzards pick at the glorious host. A communion of his flesh for the scavengers. Our western god has succumb to a Promethean sky burial. What can be done you ask? Rekindle the fires of your ancestors and they will tell you what must be done. Rekindle the fire within yourself. Become who you are.
<|endoftext|> Anyone have good summary links to initiation rItuals?[This might be of service](
<|endoftext|>The CNP has come up more than a few times in my research due to the number of overlapping Fellowship members and ties to foreign government evangelicals. The membership is secretive, so it's really difficult to research either the CNP or the Fellowship. :(
<|endoftext|>Thank you! There are many problems with the test chapter stylistically (art and writing) that I hope will be ironed out in upcoming chapters. The research on the main project is pretty difficult and time consuming, but I had to do one short story from my research to see at least a little something done with all that work. When I saw several Ben Carson staffers move to Trump's campaign, then the Mike Pence VP selection, I started picking up my research again after taking a couple years off for "life stuff."
<|endoftext|>You mean a document from the intentionally secretive group which says exactly that? No. I just have the same massive evidence of associations that most conspiracy theories have. I'm pretty concerned about the documented evangelical domestic and foreign policy agendas, coming out of the non-religious, secular businessman's office. I hope many Christians are concerned about that as well, since mixing business and politics with religion has historically yielded terrible human consequences. 
<|endoftext|>I added the link to show it is a bipartisan group. The bit about the liberal media largely focused on Republican sex scandals is my criticism that [they don't cover this group outside of Republican sex scandals.]( If you search the group online, the majority of mainstream news articles laud the group, except when covering Republican sex scandals (a favorite topic for some reason). I personally wish corporate media would report more on the bipartisan militant actions the group is tied to, [like Kony 2012]( But the corporate media supports shit like militarizing dictators when both parties agree, or any military action really. It is something Democrats, Republicans, and the corporate sponsored media agree on, so the news of ties to dictators, genocides, civil wars, coups, drugs, and more "shadowy" activities... does not get wide coverage.  
<|endoftext|>More fun to make people think!!!No, I wasn't reffering to a specific artifact, Hitler discovered the Aryans were the ORIGINAL Canaanites: NON HEBREW Semites, who founded Babylon - who were kicked out of their own homeland when the Exodus passed through. They were the original holders of the ancient knowledge we all seek - and had it appropriated: along with the title/history of "Semites", their land, culture, gods, stories and destiny.[Saddam had himself painted as one of these original semites: Nebuchadnezzar]( [Bonus](
<|endoftext|>I was skeptical about Giants, until I came across this: an hr long, but I found it interesting there are multiple burial sites from 2500 bc across the US of men and women over 8' tall, most buried with trinkets and inscribed plates. The video has a Mormon slant, but there was a lot of good information to it, which pretty much covers what you stated. 
<|endoftext|> ancient societies that predate the Egyptians. The Egyptian mysteries are the last place that the history is very easy to track. There are various legends dating to before the Egyptian mysteries and even before the flood, such as the Brotherhood of the Snake, masonic connections to Nimrod, Tubal Cain, and Enoch, but we don't have much to go on.
<|endoftext|>Smith was telling the same story everyone else involved in the mysteries has been saying... whether or not it is TRUE and not just a fabrication to legitimize their "blood line rule" or whatever, remains to be seen.Edit: Excellent reply by the way, thank you! You would probably enjoy the works of [Josh Reeves]( if you want to look more into this stuff... (his up to date page is [here]( but the fan page has is his earlier works)
<|endoftext|>So, you dislike giants, so my whole post is disinformation? Someone's bias is showing.So, you know the ultimate truth of everything then? Tell me.
<|endoftext|>Obviously the word giant isn't the same in any language so you're logic with language makes no sense.. 
<|endoftext|>i don't know i am waiting for Allen Greens next book to come out even if the dude is a total fraud and its all bullshit (which i do not believe it is at all) it is so good. 
<|endoftext|>Shakespeare was not a real guy a crazy school of people hid super intricate codes for us to find later hidden in the works of Shakespeare. Shakespeares tomb is filled with mysterious items and we want to open the sucker up and have a look at them. the guy from the video has worked for years decoding Shakespeare and has found that there are a lot of mathematical shit in the codes. including the distance to the sun the distance to the moon the etc etc its sooooo good watch it. 
<|endoftext|>interesting. do you know which of the 33 degrees you vow yourself to secrecy on the penalty of death?
<|endoftext|>A ressurected or ascended figure is central to many religions. Osiris, Jesus, Mithra, Hiram Abiff, others. It's probably directly related to The Nile River's flood and dry cycles and the sun coming up. Is it all different twists to the same legend?Most of the mystery religions teach some variation of the dying and resurrecting god. These tend to center around explaining the seasons (Persephone) or fertility magic (Baal), but the deity is generally brought back by some kind of sexual act.While the details may be similar, the explanation of the story in the Bible is dissimilar. The sacrifices in the Torah are done to atone for moral guilt of humans. In the New Testament, the god dies as an atonement for all of humanity, the "Lamb of God," with God not sparing his own son as he spared Abraham's son.
<|endoftext|>That's kind of what happens in Tibetan Buddhism and the line of Dalai Lamas. Then again, Tibetan Buddhism has Dzogchen, also known as Tibetan Dream Yoga. You learn to have lucid dreams and astrally project. Projecting your consciousness from your body is a valuable skill to learn. You stop believing in death and you stop identifying with the body.
<|endoftext|>yeah ive heard the same of pharohs ruling for thousands of years through john Anthony wests studies. thats a cool idea, you got me thinking now too. i heard the capstone would be used to project some type of light into the sky. was that light the consciousness in some form? also have heard of their obsession with the star Sirius. it has importance in freemasonry too which has a connection to the egyptian mystery schools. maybe that was the death and rebirth they were obsessed with. they were obsessed with death, and had the book of the dead which they were taught while alive to be able to know what to expect in the afterlife, and maneuver it successfully. 
<|endoftext|>He's talking about Nas, Jadakiss and Styles P whike you're talking about Lil Uzi Vert and xxxtentacion. Hes talking about rap, not this new garbage they sell as rap
<|endoftext|>I haven't heard 1 song from any of the guys you mentioned. I don't consider them rappers. These young guys have all sold out and sucked the devils dick. Only a select few have stayed true (j. Cole, kendrick). All these mumble rappers are trash. Nas told us in 2006 that hip hop is dead. I'm talking the legendary classic rappers were anti occult, with maybe biggie being an exception 
<|endoftext|>ok. here the Game's version off of 'Dreams' from the Documentary album. "They say sleep is the cousin of death. So my eyes wide open, cause a dream is a kin to your last breath." I dont think hes referencing letting his guard down. sounds more like trying to stay "awake" than be sleeping. 
<|endoftext|>Just gonna hop on this comment, but if anyone is looking for free books online about occult and secret society stuff check out /r/Alexandria 
<|endoftext|>A theory I subscribe to is the fairs were part of a conspiracy to cleans all traces of the antediluvian society. Funny enough there will be one this year in Astana Kazakhstan the Masonic capitol of the so called nwo.
<|endoftext|>We don't have them in the US anymore because congress outlawed it; the host country/city foots the bill like when you host the Olympics and we don't want to pay. They still happen every year, I think it was in Milan a few years ago.
<|endoftext|>Oh it's all good figured out what God was showing me. Took me a while , God sure is patient. You are right brother. It's all coming now. It's not going to be the end of the world but more a cleansing and a fresh restart.
<|endoftext|>Praise the person who transcribed this. I disliked watching video / audio of his radio shows. I hope they had an audio to text program otherwise that must have been quite the process. 
<|endoftext|>haha more like theyre shutting down to clean all the cum off the walls wherever they banged those poor boys. might take years
<|endoftext|> The book The Temple and the Lodge by Baigent and Leigh reveals some fascinating tidbits about cooperation between Freemasons in both the British and American forces, especially the officers.Yes. That's the best source I have found on the topic and it does a good job of showing how the masons were all working together under the assumption that the American Revolution was going to be a controlled blowing off of steam. It wasn't, however, because Washington and Franklin had planned out a real revolution decades in advance.The Bavarian Illuminati was one of their projects. It was exposed because it was supposed to be exposed to create division, chaos, and confusion among the Freemasons in Europe.
<|endoftext|>Baigent and Leigh use sources which are known to be hoaxes and they treat them as accepted history. Basically they are clickbait whores. If you want well researched dope about high weirdness in early America this might be the book you want: Upstate Cauldron Eccentric Spiritual Movements in Early New York State Joscelyn Godwin To make a long story short after the Revolutionary War the new American government decided all the Indian tribes who had allied with the British had to vacate far west fast. This left lots of room for people to homestead. They thought the land they were colonizing was empty. It was empty of people but it was not really empty. Almost every single fringe religious movement of the 19th century (there were hundreds) traces back to this area roughly Albany to Buffalo. Did it ever occur to you that the angel who revealed itself to Joseph Smith was actually a pissed off Indian spirit who tricked the holy fuck out of him? Well that never occurred to me until I read Godwin's wonderful book. (I am not claiming that was what actually happened. But it never occurred to me that is what might have happened until I read this book.)[Link](
<|endoftext|>Southern Poverty Law Center released the CNP's [membership list](
<|endoftext|>2017 for me was almost nothing but "life stuff" so I understand and hope that it worked out alright for you. It happens and helps shape us into who we are meant to be, whether we like it or not. 
<|endoftext|>You claim Trump is controlled by The Fellowship and that his Vice President is a member of The Fellowship.Those are just really huge claims and it'd be nice to have some kind of tangible evidence to back it up.
<|endoftext|>Have you ever wondered why Columbus sailed under a Templar flag almost 200 years after the Templars were supposedly abolished? Of course, he didn't *admit* to having secret maps that showed the New World.
<|endoftext|>Could be wrong but I believe British Zionists were already writing about the Canaanites/Phoenecians being the true Aryans. Check out L.A. Waddell. 
<|endoftext|>Its a tough pill to swallow. I ignored giant stuff for years and thought I was open minded. I have just recently begun to scratch the surface. Still have no opinon but am keeping an open mind. 
<|endoftext|>According to Manley P. Hall, Sir Francis Bacon wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare, possibly with the help of Edward Devere, and other Rosicrucians.
<|endoftext|>Sirius rises directly above The Nile right before or at the start of flood season, bringing life giving water and ressurecting a "dead" region.
<|endoftext|>Honestly, that's a really close minded view of hip hop and not one I'd expect from someone who is (seemingly) open minded enough to discuss conspiracies.There are lots of great new school rappers, and you can say J. Cole and Kendrick have sold out just as much as any other rapper (J. Cole did the whole typical label shit with his first album, Kendrick is reselling his album as a "collector's edition" with the only difference being the track list is in reverse). Furthermore, calling anything "mumble rap" is just an excuse to be ignorant. Plenty of so called "mumble rappers" are perfectly understandable, and even if you couldn't understand them that would still be stupid to discount them because of it (do you think all music in languages you don't understand is stupid?). 
<|endoftext|>Nas calls himself a prophet. Secret society or not fuck him and the lifestyle all those mother fuckers help perpetuate. 
<|endoftext|>Hey friend, I'm sorry to inform you that you've been shadowbanned by the reddit admins.As a mere /r/conspiracy mod, I can only see your shadowbanned comment, approve it, and inform you of your predicament.I recommend contacting the admins ASAP and good luck!
<|endoftext|> A theory I subscribe to is the fairs were part of a conspiracy to cleans all traces of the antediluvian society.I would love to hear more.
<|endoftext|>Ive never come across this theory before but it sounds interesting and plausible. Can you point me to any research, anything in fact, where I can start? Maybe because we live in the internet age I have an information bias, I can search and find a treasure trove of data, but the very concept of a World Fair blows me away and seems like something that is so overt and strange there has to be an underlying reason. 
<|endoftext|>That book sounds amazing, thanks for the rec, both of you.[Here]( is a link to pdf if anyone else is looking. 
<|endoftext|>Thanks for that! This is from after the last time I looked into the CNP and definitely will be read soon. :)
<|endoftext|>I posted a video link of [Jeff Sharlet stating that Mike Pence is a member of the group]( that he wrote a [couple of books about.]( I did not say that Trump was controlled by the group, I said that the Fellowship is the actual power in the White House. Trump holds the title of President and the people around him do the heavy lifting. One of the earliest articles I have about the Fellowship is [an interview Jeff Sharlet did soon after living with some of the group for a few weeks.]( This may give you some idea about them, and there is more online if you become interested in the group.Jeff Sharlet dug through this unorganized collection to write his book:Brief Description:Correspondence, reports, financial records, minutes of meetings, reference files, clippings, newsletters, and other materials relating to the work of the Foundation (also known as International Christian Leadership) which involved developing small-group prayer fellowships, especially among government, business, and academic leaders. There is a great deal of information on the annual presidential prayer breakfast in the United States and similar events in other parts of the United States and in other countries. Also documented is the group's involvement in various community development, patriotic, and personal growth projects. There are restrictions on the use of this collection.Vol.: 592 boxes (DC; 240 cubic feet), Audio tapes, Films, Negatives, PhotosThe group's documents from 1937 to 1988 are available at the [Billy Graham Center archives in Wheaton, Il.]( , but that stuff is not online, unfortunately, and it is unlikely to contain anything about Mike Pence that long ago. Jeff Sharlet's book is largely based on research done in the archives, interviews with high profile members, a month long stay among them at one of their exclusive properties, and the large amount of work an investigative journalist does for a multi year long investigation. If I can think of something better than that tying Mike Pence to the group, I'll come back and post it, but it's unlikely. All I can really say is to read about the group from multiple sources, weigh your opinion on Jeff Sharlet's knowledge of the group, and decide from there I guess.Edit: I will come back here sometime soon and post some more links and commentary since this subject did get a little more interest than it usually does here. Thanks for not taking what I say without question; I will try to explain this stuff better in a more detailed post! 
<|endoftext|>No, Ive not wondered that, because the documents of the time describe Columbus using a banner with a green cross and the initials F and Y, not a Templar cross. Also worth noting that Columbus was from Genoa, whose flag was also a red cross on white background. Furthermore, although the Templars were destroyed, those in Portugal were reconstituted as the Order of Christ, inheriting the wealth and status of the local Templars and acquiring Papal recognition in 1319. Wheres the source that Columbus flew a Templar flag, anyway? I cant find even a non-reputable source for this online. 
<|endoftext|>Whatever it is they possess that is the birthright of all people - even if there is no secret at all... (ie: no more than men lying (all the way to aliens/god/magic etc))
<|endoftext|>Your logic does not address native American accounts of the men of giant proportions. They don't call them giants, so why are we discussing the English language history of the word giant? It's irrelevant to the ideas being discussed.
<|endoftext|>j cole has comoletely sold out. he admitted it. he did it under jay z who was his connection. he turned the lights on for him, allowing him to run his own Roc Nation label, which has a lot of popular artists. some you might not even expect, like shakira. but as j cole said, "you have to play the game, to change the game." hes doing it for a good cause, in the long term.if you can clearly understand those mumble rap songs, listen to jay-Z, 'Do It Again' from his vol. 3... album, try to keep up and tell me what rapping is now, compared to what it originally was. in terms of the skills required to be the best in the game as jay-z is. they call themselves rappers, but theyre not doing the music the gangster rappers did. like how theres classic rock, and grunge rock. theres gangster rap which is anti occult. and theres mumble rap to dumb down society probably as a plan developed during the recent commercialization of rap music by the tptb, to destroy the rap industry. 
<|endoftext|> his song released in 1999 called "New World", off the album Nastradmus. he predicts what the world will be like heading forward into the year 2000 and beyond. one of the many many many things he predicts is "the rich get tickets to visit mars, while the poor people starve." elon musk and boeing in 2017 have just announced theyre racing to mars. elon musk owns telsa, and rich people buy his cars. so these rich people might also buy his tickets to visit mars, if he decides to sell this type of transportation. and theres a lot of poor people and probably will be for a long time comingi think if there were more people like him around the world, earth might be a better place. havent you heard what the world would be like if he ruled it? doesnt sound too bad 
<|endoftext|>don't have my ideas in order, very much a work in progress theory. I post tangentially related material to my sub r/CulturalLayer the researcher Martin Liedtke also agrees with this concept and if you can ignore the silly name of his show most of his research into history is very thought provoking i'll leave a link bellow. 
<|endoftext|>im certainly not the only researcher who thinks theres something weird here. this dude puts out some amazing research you can follow my research at r/culurallayer
<|endoftext|>[Columbus flag]( Same pattern as the Templars, just a different color. Just like how the Templars in Portugal reconstituted as the Order of Christ, but kept much of their secret knowledge.Look into the explosion of seafaring knowledge that happens around Prince Henry the Navigator, when Portugal is supposedly a poor backwater of Europe. They were finding islands all over the Atlantic, beginning with Madeira in 1420, as if they had a rough idea of where everything was. By 1488 they had reached the tip of Africa, 1498 India, 1500 Brazil, and 1542 Japan.
<|endoftext|>"I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollarsThey criticized me for it, yet they all yell "holla"- also jay-z 
<|endoftext|>What about his silly name "Lied"tke? What the fuck? To be completely honest these names of people that make public "waves" are so bizarre. Just like: Reality Winner  her full name is "Reality Leigh Winner"What the fuck? Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  Tzar"naevAwww, no, they didnt!  Edward SnowdenSnowed in? Are they telling us something? Maybe they want us isolated and fearful of being spied on. (Think intentionally "leaked" documents for guiding the mind of the herd.)It's all a show, folks. (Sounds like something the brilliant Bill Cooper would say. The "local" (?) police seemed to have killed him for it)
<|endoftext|>One interesting thing I'll add quickly is that I was researching an obscure-ish international religious NGO (because I thought it seemed scammy) for a few months, going through their own publications and researching the things I found there. The research starting becoming more than a mere "scam" as I was noticing many links to the military industrial complex, political institutions, banks, oil companies, etc. Then I found Jeff Sharlet's book and there were so many of the same connections I had independently made via different research and documents. It was pretty surreal. The NGO I was researching is just one organization in "The Family." I will write about that unnamed NGO sometime in the not too near future.Also, as far as "traditional conspiracy theories" go, the closest I can think of is "The Octopus" conspiracy theory that an [independent researcher was writing a book about when he "died mysteriously."]( I say this because when I first read about the Octopus in some articles online, I was well aware of everything they mentioned because of my own independent research. That and some [crazy Wayne Madsen articles about the Fellowship]( creep me out, as an "independent researcher."  
<|endoftext|>Madeira was known even in ancient times and appeared on maps for nearly a century before being discovered by the Portuguese. Even then, it wasnt formally mapped and discovered until two ships were blown there by storms. Hardly the mark of a grand conspiracy. As for the exploration of the African and Indian coasts, the Portuguese literally just coasted along Africa until they reached the end. Once to the eastern coast, knowledge and maps of India were available. Local knowledge also allowed them to find Japan. First landfall in Brazil was also by accident and the land was initially believed to be an island (and was in fact named as such at first). You act like the Portuguese just got into a ship and sailed directly to these new, unknown destinations. But this isnt true. Their discoveries built upon each other, and exploration was slow and methodical. The discovery of Brazil was dependent upon knowledge of the Canaries and a fort established on the African coast. Explorations of the western coast of Africa were done step by step, each voyage going further than the one before. Im sure none of this will mean anything to you. You think it was mystical Templar knowledge, despite there being no evidence of such - fine. But the history is there for you to learn (and if you dont trust what is taught, most of the primary documents still exist) if you want. 
<|endoftext|> In the eyes of a historian, the Paiutes annihilated a rival tribe and mythologized them into fearsome, cannibalistic giants.You are assuming that a certain claim is proven and shared by others, when that isn't the case. Specifically, you believe that most ancient stories about phenomena that are not currently observable were fabrications.There are several examples I can give you that prove that this approach of scoffing at ancient stories has done history a terrible disservice. The most obvious example is the assumption that stories about an ancient flood (coming from hundreds of different cultures) were made up. Recent evidence has shown that there really was a worldwide cataclysm after a comet impact roughly 12000 years ago, and this includes 1000 foot-tall tsunamis and extensive flooding.Another example is the dismissal of stories that the Egyptian pyramids were tens of thousands of years old. It was long assumed that the Egyptian pyramids were built by Khufu about 4500 years ago. As real scientific investigation has been done, it has become clear that the pyramids are much, much older, as evidenced by water erosion on the surface.In other words, it's not a good idea to assume that all of these stories are myths, rather than legends or in some cases being fairly accurate depictions.
<|endoftext|>do you have any more information about the hidden information in the "names" that make it to the public? I am very interested in this. 
<|endoftext|>Lol no the flat earth British partI tried to write Self post recently explaining the memetic nature of flat earth I think some people understand
<|endoftext|> Madeira was known even in ancient times and appeared on maps for nearly a century before being discovered by the Portuguese. Even then, it wasnt formally mapped and discovered until two ships were blown there by storms. Hardly the mark of a grand conspiracy. That *is* the conspiracy. The Portugese had old maps, which is why they knew where all of the islands were. The "blown off course by storms" is a cover story, just as looking for a route to India was Columbus cover story, when the reality is that the ancients traded with the so-called New World, and this knowledge was eventually concealed during later times.You think it was mystical Templar knowledgeOnly mystical in the sense that it wasn't widely known at the time. Not that they were using telekinesis or something.
<|endoftext|>Don't you get it, man? Some tribe fought another tribe and won, but because ancient people were so stupid they consistently depicted them as giants who ate people as a metaphor for how ferocious they fought back. But obviously the tribe that won were more ferocious to win against them. That's why they depict themselves as... Uhh... Normal looking people? Wait a second... 
<|endoftext|>No, sorry. These are just the ones that were bizarre enough to recall when I came across Liedke. I suppose Ob($)ama could even be considered a candidate for the list...
<|endoftext|>History. Which is more likely, that a backwater nation locked in constant warfare to retake the Iberian peninsula suddenly became the world leaders in navigational technology, or that they had some kind of information that wasn't available to other nations?
<|endoftext|>Check out this book by Freddy Silva: "First Templar Nation: How Eleven Knights Created a New Country and a Refuge for the Grail". Plenty of evidence in there. Great book, and very well researched.
<|endoftext|>Sorry, I thought the sarcasm was obvious. Should have put a /s at the end there. I know there's been blatant obfuscation of our human history and where we come from and who else we've shared this earth with. I was just using my comment as an example to show how stupid the assumptions made today with regards to ancient man are. 
<|endoftext|>Considering that:- Portugal had completed its Reconquista in 1249  - Portugals discoveries largely followed those of Spain in the New World (Brazil wasnt discovered under *after* the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, obviously after Spanish ships had proven the existence of a New World)  - Portugal was far from a backwater nation in the sixteenth century  - There is no evidence of any hidden knowledge influencing their explorations, Templar or otherwiseYes, Ill say that the mainstream version is much more likely. Seriously, do you have any shred of evidence? So far your evidence has consisted of a flag, incorrectly identified as a Templar banner, and a leading question. 
<|endoftext|>Check out this book by Freddy Silva: "First Templar Nation: How Eleven Knights Created a New Country and a Refuge for the Grail". Plenty of evidence in there. Great book, and very well researched.
<|endoftext|>Banking as a whole is parasitic. Many financial institutions make up rules that are impossible to follow to charge fees to customers left and right. When they fail to generate enough profit from these shady practices they resort to explicitly criminal activities. David graeber makes a great point about how crucial banks are to our society when comparing the strike from bank of America workers to the time when the NY garbage workers went on strike. It took no time at all for the city of NY to fall into chaos as trash piled up everywhere and people noticed a large impact on quality of life. When bankers go on strike no body notices. We could have a system that lends to those who need it for essentially nothing which would be much more efficient, instead we have a system where we have to pay money to access our own money via ATM.I think Peter Joseph hits the nail on the head when talking about how unnatural these institutions are to the state of nature. There is no reason to have such a thing except for robinhood in reverse.Also; Citigroup hand picked Obamas cabinet members
<|endoftext|>If we the people started our own NOT FOR PROFIT bank. we could be free by the end of the week.everyone agrees to have their wages paid into the co-op.loans, mortgages and credit cards at 1%all profits paid to all with an account as a dividend share.its so easy, the point is that banks are set up for the soul reason to extract wealth via usury. this is why usury was unlawful illegal and immoral.but when you have bankers who make the laws you are fucked. all that is really needed is the masses to get good enough at maths to realize they are being robbed blind.  but thats hardly going to happen at this rate.plus you need to have a banking license to set up a bank... and guess who issues them.....  doh
<|endoftext|>I feel like the idea of American "sovereignty" is sort of tangential to this whole topic. The same people who cry about "sovereignty" are usually first in line to sell out to foreign banks.no bloated military - no stupid foreign wars - no national debt - real sovereigntyIs that likely to happen? Let's just say I'm not betting on it.
<|endoftext|>1. In a public company, the shareholders own the company. Shareholders care about one thing above all else, getting a return on their investment. This includes the average joe with a 401k or who invests savings in the stock market. When the owners of the company want a return on their investment, it means they employ their employees 'CEO' and other managers to pursue profit above all else. Profit is what makes a company's stock price go up. This is important because it shows that 'pursuit of profit' is actually structurally built in to the system in this regard. Therefore it is incorrect to assume that those who are pursuing profits are all greedy and evil. This current structure needs to be changed, but this is outside of the discussion for the time being.2. Federal Reserve has been printing money in a way that is unconstitutional. This needs to stop. It's the world's currency.3. Oligarchs, politicians, lobbyists, and investors hide their agenda by using complicated webs of proxy and shell companies that can make it nearly impossible to link back to the original person or group. This is how money is often transferred and accountability is avoided. 4. Govt. budgets are not what they seem. Often times money or resources from departments you would least expect are actually used to add money to black projects. This is in addition to the $40-$80 billion annually that goes to black projects. Other ways of raising money for black projects are stealing drugs from terrorists and selling them on US streets (CIA) and getting the federal reserve to print more money illegally.5. One World Government has one aim and that is to transform earth into a slave planet ruled by a handful of elites. There is no other way to see it. That is what it is. It would seem that movements with seemingly positive intentions like 'global warming' and 'globalization' have either been hijacked by NWO and are being used to push their evil agenda, or they were lies from the onset.6. The shadow government controls the deep state and the deep state controls the media, entertainment industry, and many in government.7. The deep state enforces its secrecy with blackmail. This means that the morally corrupted and easy to control are selected for positions of power. They use satanic cults, pedophilia, abuse, murder and other illegal acts performed as rituals for several important reasons, one of which being creating blackmail opportunities. Brainwashed manchurian candidates (mk ultra) are used in positions of power as well. They are the evil guys who say one message, but in reality do the exact opposite.
<|endoftext|>The New World Order is essentially "the" conspiracy. All other conspiracies that are perpetrated by this global crime syndicate, are essentially miniature steps toward accomplishing the ultimate goal. This is the wet dream of our defective and sadistic ruling class, and it always has been. 9/11, Iran Contra, Geoengineering, big pharma, planned obsolescence, and all the NSA spying and illegal wars are all "steps" toward this grand conspiracy to essentially take over the globe and install a global dictatorship where the elite are gods and have total control. This full length documentary by Jason Bermas woke me up. Don't listen to the people criticizing the documentary simply because Infowars produced it.

<|endoftext|>As it stands, the banks own our economy. People talk about the lack of bipartisanship in our government but it is clear through the way our politicians serve, that they serve the same people with the same policies. They are sold to the banks and major organizations for the purpose of feeding money into the system that "feeds the beast" i.e. the Cabal to provide them with all the power and resources they want. The system is built to serve the system.For example in the media, as we know, there are only a handful of people who own most of the media. These conglomerates work with each other to ensure that the major media stays in their control through major mergers. Those major mergers are all brokered by the same investment bank, Allen & Co. who ensures that the merger weaves out of the way of anti trust laws as well as ensuring that everyone makes a profit, especially Allen & Co. who take a chunk of the merger money as well.This is shady enough, but where it truly gets interesting (and gets more to the point of this discussion) is in the people Allen & Co employs, as well as the assets they have aquired.Currently Allen & Co employs former senators Bob Kerrey and Bill Bradley and most notably their Managing Director is former CIA director George Tenet, manufacturer of the 'War on Terror'They maintain a place on Coca Cola's board, the own major portions of Alphabet and Twitter. It has owned Columbia Pictures. They have irons in nearly every single fire in the market. They employ everyone from former government employees to former sports stars. They essentially pull the strings in the media and yet they are only a bank, and not even a well known bank but a very secretive bank. They are terrifying and they likely have ties to every media coorporation in the world, and financial ties to hotel, beverage, social media, telecom, film, and telivision markets just to name a few. They are a household name among the elites and they lead the way in the total coorporate consolidation of the global market, which is one of the greatest proofs of a Globalist Cabal.

<|endoftext|>I'm just going to copypasta from [a comment]( I put together over at /r/ConspiracyII.I've spent years since being the man with the boots kicking doors down trying to pursue the truth of the global big picture.I am increasingly convinced, by following the evidence, that the primary instigator against the US has been the British elite. (Not ignoring the Vatican/Jesuit, other issues though) I'm going to skip the citations which often bog down and just give the summary.[comment too long so this section will be in a reply below]In essence, the monarchy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and supranational bankers never forgave the US for the revolution, and recognize that as the only country founded on the principles of indivdualism and natural rights, it is the primary threat to their desire for a centralized new world order of globalism (that will be painted as a benign savior, but they will control it from the shadows). Therefore, the United States is the primary target of the NWO now that we have successfully toppled almost every opposition country in the world. These people think and work on much longer time-frames, so delays may happen (for example, Wesley Clark's 7 nation list was supposed to happen in 5 years, but it took ~17), but rest assured, once we are over extended enough, weak enough, probably through the last few wars that "need" to happen, the real attack on the US will begin. Syria is only a precursor for Iran war. Korea is the precursor for China war. Muslim extremists in southeast asia are likely to be the warmup for both of those. Instead of being a relative cakewalk though, as Afghanistan and Iraq were, this time the design will be similar to the Brisbane line "bleed-out" strategy. Vietnam level KIA/WIA, in order to get rid of our hardest combat men, most likely while escalating the miltarism of the police and other domestic agencies in preperation.
<|endoftext|>It's out in the open that a relatively small group(s) of very wealthy people in positions of power aim to dominate the world. Is it still a conspiracy if the masses are too dumb down and apathetic to understand this fact? "The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world." - Carroll Quigley-------"For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn't. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations -- One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared "ammunition" in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support. The UN is but a long--range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One--World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. The depression was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank." - Curtis Dall-----"For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as "internationalists" and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it." ~ David Rockefeller-------"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson." - Franklin D.

<|endoftext|>I agree with the problem, but not the solution.How do we have a system that lends to those who needs it for nothing? There would be no incentive for people to lend, and plenty of incentive for people to exploit. There would be nobody facilitating the transaction since they are not getting paid. How do we get past that without incentives?The problem here is not interest rates, its how most businesses are a mutated form of pyramid schemes, especially the finance industry. At the lowest level, you have your relationship managers, insurance agents etc. Pushing bad products and loans to people who don't have the ability to pay. But the system is in such a way that these agents get incentivized doing so.

<|endoftext|>I feel like you're making two independent points here.. Excuse me if I may..1. Modern citizens lack sufficient civil interest to understand how their votes, taxes and general complacency only fuels the fire that burns freedom. Yes. And people on the whole lack the conscious powers to understand true and logic fallacies - let alone their own potential - I'm applying broad dollops of artistic Liberty to your point here but with this framing then yes I agree  .. However ...2. American sovereignty is somehow tangential to the story of banksters and their oligarchic rise to one world domination. On this point I disagree - America is the story. Maybe less as we look forward. But the Rise of bankings global class is etched into American history. Not just the rise of modern financial Titans but also the primary cultural battleground for civil takeover. You see America dared to dream. In America that underlying dream was freedom. To be a Republic free from church or state totalitarianism yes but especially to be free from the banking malaise. America grew from independent currency - Colonial Scrip and despite some funding of unrest, much foundational infrastructure was borne from independent banking, so much it caused the Civil War, motivated generations of iconic American leaders and bonded generations of pioneers. Example is the Bank War -  - a popular enough rally point, to fight off a second concerted effort of putting a Central Bank into Americas heart. Enough by the way to keep that particular beast at bay for another 80 years until the creature came back from Jekyll Island. The wider point being that American people have always fought banks. It's deeply ironic now of course that America is a weapon wielded by Wall St. Ironic yes. But tangential - absolutely not. Fuck the War on Terror. Control of Money is America's biggest battle. Always has been. And unfortunately most Americans find it hard to swallow the fact they've been on the losing side of this one for over a century now.
<|endoftext|>The same people who cry about "sovereignty" are usually first in line to sell out to foreign banks.My history is a bit rusty. Refresh my memory. Which foreign banks did Thomas Jefferson sell out to? Jefferson:"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."And surprise, the top 1% own 95% of the wealth.

<|endoftext|>  1812 - British invasion  1839 - First opium wars to soften Asia up by British.  1841 - British instigation of Mexican-American war due to desire for the territories.  1854 - British used Americas power et al to force Japan to open up.  1856 - Second opium war as part of long term British takeover of China strategy.  1860 - British backed confederacy through infiltration of masonic and KKK orgs to try to divide and conquer us. Russian Tsar sent fleets to protect us against British backed invasion. (an army was amassed on other side of mexican border. )  1890s - Spanish American war where British covertly armed and funded the US as an ally in a ploy to decrease the animosity Americans had for them. (Maine false flag)  Late 1800s through early 1900s - Some of the American Indian wars (most the east coast, Hudson bay ones) secretly backed by British.  1899 - Phillipine war triggered by British globalists Paris Treaty  1900 - Eight nation alliance against China as test of alliance style entanglement of US into war.  1909 - Normad Dodd indications that Cecil Rhodesian group planned to infiltrate our education system and state department in preperation for getting us into war, which King Edward the 7th setup by creating the triple entente. This is the primary place the Rothschild Zionist banking group comes in, because Edward the 7th gave gave zionist bankers access to the court (court jews) in exchange for profits.  1910 - Edward 7 dies unexpectedly, throwing small wrench in plans. Rhodesian/Rothschild group carries on. British backed Japanese annex Korea as part of coming propup of Russia/Korean enemy.  1913 - Woodrow Wilson elected on the promise of not taking us to war. His handler, Edward House, and his handler, Sir Earl Grey (yes the tea), manipulated him into the war.  1914 - WW1 starts as planned  1916/17 - America dragged into the war, while bankers funded Nazis and Bolshevik revolution (and killed the Tsar and his family in revenge for his father Alexander III thwarting the 1860 plan) British use likely false-flag Zimmermann Telegram to bring US into WW1 on the heels of the Border war.  1939-45 - WW2 as continuation of WW1. British sought to make American losses great in the Pacific so at the end of the war there would be a balance of powers. (Brisbane line pushed by Churchil along with the island hopping strategy, which McArthur saw through and ignored, instead creating the leapfrog strategy, leading to the defeat of the Japanese at Guadalcanal.) Don't forget war plan red in which the US knew Britain might become an enemy.  1949 - British globalists used Kissinger et al to support Mao as the new communist enemy against the nationalist Chiang Kai-shek. British backed New york bankers and Harriman group funded Stalin as part of the coming cold war, intending for Stalin to push the north of China. One telling fact is that the British were one of the first nations to recognize Mao's government and started sending him supplies.  1950 - The British, looking to cut the US down since the Pacific play didn't work as well as intended, got the Korean war kicked off. The Harriman group pushed Truman into Korea, and they tried to setup McArthur by giving him inferior forces and supplies (likely in revenge for his thwarting of the pacific bleed-out strategy), but McArthur's strategic brilliance ended up winning despite him being setup to fail. Since instead of weakening the US, the "win" (hard to call it that with so many casualties), in Korea actually strengthened the US, the British started playing double and triple spy games in London to further foment the cold war. Using groups like the Cambridge 6 (everyone knows of the Cambridge 5, the 6th man was Victor Rothschild, and many more than just that), to leak information to the soviets as part of the strategy. (they were triples because, on the surface they were British agents, next layer they worked for KGB, but underneath both of those were working for the Monarchy and oligarchs, creating plausible deniability for the British.)  1951 - Through the leaks of this group to Mao, Mao knew when to commit massive forces to Korea in the third phase offensive.  1958 - Lebanon Crisis the first inklings of the coming cold war, anti-communist justification for interventionism.  1961 - Second inkling of cold war via Bay of pigs as inevitable type of offshoot of organic Cuban alliance with Soviets (no first hand British involvement as far as I can tell)  1963-75 - British setup of Vietnam (Laos/Cambodia) conflict (which they tested on the French) culminated with the assassination of president Diem, with the help of the CIA/MI6, with Henry Cabot Lodge participating. Despite this, Kennedy resisted the entanglement, but was conveniently assassinated himself exactly 20 days after Diem, which gave the pre-controlled LBJ the presidency so the globalists could push for escalation. The British officer Sir Robert Grainger Ker Thompson was one of the main strategists advocating for escalation, even before JFK was shot, and was supposedly the worlds first expert on counter-insurgency operations (COIN) due to his success in Malaya. Robert McNamara, SecDef, later wrote a book which verified that after JFK, Thompson was the single most influential person pushing LBJ into Vietnam. He advocated for an occupation style strategy (one of the first references to a "hearts and minds" strategy I've found) with many US boots on the ground in the south. The South Vietnamese defense minister recognized the real threat as the NVA and their infiltration along the Ho Chi Minh, and recommended a fortified line from the DMZ into the edge of Laos to block the Ho Chi Minh, giving the south Vietnamese army the breathing room they needed to take civic action in their own country (as opposed to foreign occupation), and if the NVA massed to attack the line, US amphibious landings could quickly counter and destroy them. Thompson condemned this plan, likely as part of the British plan to further entangle and weaken the US in pursuance of "the balance of power", because in the end, the south lost due to exactly that, a cross border invasion of the NVA. The Viet Cong was in essence, a diversion. Did I mention Thompson was a close friend of Kissinger?  1982-89 - Libya bombing, Grenada, Panama, Lebanon - all extensions of the cold war or wars to protect Israels (Rothschild Zionists) interests.  1990 - First gulf war as natural extension of setup by British of the Baathists and also the Sauds in the early 1900's, with Kuwait as the oil rich middle chess peice.  1992-94 - First main testing of British globalist NATO in military operations in the Yugoslav wars.  2001+ - British Rothschild Zionists use their plausible deniability teams (MI6, Mossad, and CIA, Pakistani ISI, Saudi GID) to attack the WTC and instigate the war in Afghanistan and later Iraq and eventually the entire, never-ending global war on terrorism. The British learned how to play the superior military power of the US and is/was repeating the playbook of getting us into a quagmire (like we and they did to the Soviets in Afghanistan), so as to weaken our military (backfired slightly in the sense that we got much better at 21st century combat), but primarily to overextend our financial and political resources globally and to lose much of our international support. All of this most likely in preperation for an internal coup of the US through subversion, infiltration, and blackmail or coercion of top positions through all three branches of government including the fourth estate of journalism and media as they merger and aquisition their way to monoplies and further centralization in preperation for the ushering in of the NWO, most likely to start through a currency collapse of the dollar and likely to be replaced with a global or North American Union/Euro type digital currency (such as bitcoin) designed to seem like a savior while it's real intention is to allow both the tracking of all transactions and persons (cash is anonymous, BTC is not!), and it is most likely they have somehow taken control of %50+ (enough to manipulate BTC) or have a backdoor already in place.
<|endoftext|>The excuse for the bailout was that if the banks were to go under it would crash the economy too far. Obviously the real reason is greed. According to economists like Peter Schiff, if the banks hadn't gotten bailed out, it would have depressed the economy even farther for sure, and taken much longer to recover, but we would have been a stronger country in the long run and not nearly as worried about another crash in the near future. That transfer of tax dollars from the people who lost the most back into a bank bail out for the people who caused the crash and ripped everybody off...twice then...is one of the most egregious examples of an elite, greedy, corrupt, sociopathic group of people and institutions fucking the little guy outta his money and then flipping him the bird...ever.

<|endoftext|>You take the private profit out of it. Credit unions are one way to do this. They still charge interest on loans and pay interest on deposits, but the difference is that there are no private shareholders reaping the profits. Any surplus revenue the credit union makes is either returned to members as dividends, used to lower interest rates on loans, or used to increase interest rates on deposits. Credit unions also have the advantage of keeping your money closer to your community. If you put $10K in as a deposit, that will be loaned out to homebuyers or small businesses in your community. 
<|endoftext|>There are a couple solutions; either one central bank that lends, or localized institutions or directly borrowing from the people. These would be public goods and the intensive being that it provides a much needed service. Not every intensive has to be profit. I dont think exploiting the system would be much more prevalent that what we currently see. You would still have to prove in some way your ability to repay or have someone co-sign a loan.

Arms trafficking? Bankers involved. Drugs trade? Bankers. Art for money laundering? Bankers. Sex trafficking, including children? Bankers. [Even darker things. Bankers.]( think another really interesting point though is to understand the power dynamic between some of the aristocracies and the bankers. So the real question is, even for the very rich and powerful British monarchy for example, do the [bankers control the aristocracy]( or is it the other way around, or is it mutual? I feel like discovering the details of that answer/question contain much knowledge to be found.Now, for the BIS angle, I think we have to take a look at the occult in Switzerland. For example, the early CIA days had many hidden connections to what chatzefratz calls "The Octogon", [Allen Dulles a key example.]( [The Corbett Report on Allen Dulles]( the end, from my American perspective, the OSS, later the CIA, is the main rogue agency responsible for the continued infiltration and subversion of the American Constitution. Never forget that the CIA got it's start on Wall Street, and a key finding of mine is that all roads from Wall Street/DC lead to either to the City of London or the Vatican.Therefor there is also much knowledge to be gained from studying the relationship of what I call ["The Three Sister Cities".]( this is where /r/conspiracy will really pay attention. These connections are the ones that tie the modern banking system into the ancient mystery religions and the occult. The Templars connections to the Vatican and the City of London are just the surface level, and there are so many deeper things to be discovered in this realm. A key example of this is the unusual amount of CIA people who are Knights of Malta. Don't forget Malta has some of the most ancient architecture that is very relevant to occult studies. I mean from Malta we have connections to the Minoans, the uknown "sea-peoples", possibly Atlantis, and some of the other ancient cities of the occult such as Tyre, Carthage, Venice, the Pheonicians, etc.From my research it seems that Venice was at one point where the occult of the Pheonicians set up shop, and it was from there that their power after the fall of Byzantium (which they were involved in) transplanted themselves to the City of London. That said, Venice is still a huge part of the globalist conspiracy, especially regarding banking. [I don't think John Coleman is lying]( is also a huge center of the banker occult. The [Dutroux case]( gave a glimpse into it.In the end I think the thing that Carrol Quigley was [afraid of revealing]( that he discovered while researching the secret records of the round table group was that the mission of the shift from hard power British imperialism to the false "Commonwealth" was really designed to transition to banking as the "soft power" control system... and of this I take much inspiration from researching the ancient Sumerians (and the occult connections to them and the Egyptians), who I think discovered via their *priestly class* that by being the gatekeepers of the records of goods and money (tablets), they could have not just all the wealth they wanted but more centralized power than ever before.A quote from one of the men at the center of *THE* conspiracy that reveals the agenda:"Why should we not form a secret society with but one object, the furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the whole world under British rule, for the recovery of the United States, for making the Anglo Saxon race but one Empire? What a dream, but yet it is probable; it is possible." - Cecil Rhodes

<|endoftext|>Peer to peer lending exist today and it is highly risky. Why would people lend to each other without a markup knowing that the lender is very likely to default? 
<|endoftext|>You are right, it wasn't my intention to present thing in a racist manner.Unfortunately, I just don't know how to describe, or can find the right materials that do not use the word "Jew" on the banking cancer. The problem lies with the banking mafia who abused the "Jewish" banner to carry out their crimes. This I can understand if they are small little community during the medieval time, but for them continue to commit crimes under the "Jew" name is just unforgivable at this moment in the history.The other fact is ordinary Jews have been brainwashed to believe Jewish racist bigotry is commanded by God. Obviously, most of us do understand not all the Jews are like that. And to prove I am not Anti-Jew (I don't accept the term "Anti-Semitic" - this one is an abuse cos' it doesn't exist), here is one cool Jew I consider as a classy human being: - Baltzer is role model for Jews (and all the rest of racist bigots). Anyone knows her contact? I won't be surprised she has been abducted by Mossad (perhaps under the instruction of Harvey Weinstein? - Apparently Palestinians are so weak and helpless that Mossad simply got nothing better to do these day. So much as that Mossad gotta take part time jobs from Sex Pervert like Harvey Weinstein?)

<|endoftext|>Basically, it is the prototype currency that has been proposed for the New World Order global monetary system. It ties in with the ecological problems we face in the future, such as air pollution, water pollution, etc. Each country (and individual) gets a certain amount of CC, which allows them to produce a certain amount of pollution each year . If they pass that limit, they get a hefty fine. This will make it very expensive to pollute (mostly for corporations), and its suppose to help us reduce pollution over time by hitting us where it hurts, our wallets. Individual currencies will still exist (dollar, euro, etc) but CC will be the currency that connects us all. Carbon tax will also be a thing, but I'll let you look into that.
<|endoftext|>Well 1% is just insane and unrealistic as a business can't cover their operating cost of servicing the loan with all the tracking and accounting that's regulatory required, but for instance I have a 30 mortgage at 3.25% which is pretty darn low. But the larger point is, yes Credit Unions are registered non-profits and offer extremely favorable pricing with little fees. They do most of what you are talking about. No one says you need to bank with some giant corporation and I have no idea why people do, it's the worst experience and more costly than a community bank or credit union.Do you have an account with a publically traded bank?

But on what basis you can say these two "Literal Gods" aren't Jews, especially when they say they're Jews?Also, Edom is located in today's Palestine (or at least within the "Greater Israel"). What is stopping them from becoming "Jews"?Is it because these guys are basically pure Khazars.Fun Fact: I got an email from one "Robert Einstein" saying they are from Sodom. They are therefore Sodomites. I am confused.Bottomline: Both are Fake Jews?

<|endoftext|>Yeah I don't think regulation is required to keep children from working, that's called society. A society dependant on regulations will experience crisis such as 9/11 until its collapse.
<|endoftext|>I think the trick here is to realize that the power that bankers and big business owners have over our lives is partly shrouded by the frontispiece known as regulations, worker protections, collective bargaining rights, etc. Yes, those things often are beneficial to regular people. I would not deny that. And we are led to believe that those rights, etc. were won by the hard work of union organization, social movements, political protest, etc. etc. It's sort of viewed as evidence that democracy works and the people really do have power. But it's a huge deceit and part of the con. Democracy is a smokescreen. The only reason those things were and are allowed is because bankers and big business owners view them to be in their own interests as well. They can promote their own interests by announcing them to be in the interests of all. However, it does not then follow that all those regulations, etc. should be thrown out the window. [Here is some research I did]( [pdf warning] that goes into the role played by bankers and big business owners in developing The New Deal, which sheds further light on this topic. See especially pages 11-36. And [here is a link to part 2]( if you are interested.

I switched channel as soon as I heard the mc said "Our distinguished expert is going to present the truth that **"Khazars are genetically Biblical Jews"** but asked that I **do not mention his qualification or professional credential!**"Do you know if that "Genetic Expert" is a Sodomite who has lost his mind? Or could it be Polish academics are historically so dumb that they'd believe in just about anything, even if it's coming from someone whose background has nothing to do with the subject matter? (I asked cos I really have no clue)
<|endoftext|>From what I've come across in the last year of research, this is the grand conspiracy, the one which all others stem from.Humans are concious beings capable of shaping reality around them. Thoughts affect reality. We can shape reality around us. We all live in a shared reality that overlaps with our own individual realities. Formerly, our civilisation was very aware of this and lived in an equilibrium of these abilities interacting with other energetic realms which have become inaccessible to us without training and practice. I believe it may extend to such a degree that the way a person can exist in a lucid dream, by which what you experience us completely alterable at your whim, is the 'norm' for unmanipulated humans freed from the grand illusion. Our history has been covered up and altered so we don't discover this truth. Our whole society is bent around physically and mentally twisting people so they don't discover this truth. Our whole current civilisation is controlled by a small group of people descended from those who have been aware of this knowledge all along but horde it for the benefit of their own adgendas. The notion that the physical is all there is, the incorrect information about our history, the manipulation of our society by media, the hidden hand of the intelligence/military industrial complex, all of it exists to make sure that mankind does not rediscover what we actually are and what we are all capable of doing. Conciousness an entire field of study that should be on par with physics in terms of how important it is to the reality we live in and it is currently dismissed completely by established academia. That should speak volumes. 
<|endoftext|>i tried to make a thread on this a while back but got almost no attention but ill repost here as i think its relevent to ufo tech. this is a recent patent from 2015  actually one of 5 i think granted to a dr. roy subrata describing the workings of a wingless electromagnetic air vehicle, weav for short. theres pictures and they are literally micro flying saucers. they match spookily well with the description of teslas flying saucer here. this link postulates that teslas flying saucer and flying stove are the same thing but on other websites and stuff theres some debate about that.  also a team at u.c berkeley working on a quadcopter looking ionocraft design. they look drastically different but use the same scientific principles to achieve flight. i find most distressing is the push to scale this technology down to insect size rather than up to personal vehicle size. i feel like its just a matter of time before swarms of microbots turn into swarms of murderbots like some black mirror shit.the conspiracy here is that flying saucers are man made and for whatever reason tptb are content to let us think theyre aliens. possibly some of them ARE aliens but a good portion are definitely man made. this also brings up the possibility of an entire breakaway civilization of humans living somewhere other than earth by means of this technology which, like wireless transmission of power, has been around over a century!
<|endoftext|>from another discussion online. if you're interested, please look into liebniz, and come back here to discuss :)Leibniz: Conceptually the universe is a hologram, but physically it is a fractalThere are two conflicting theories of the Universe--one being that it is structured like a hologram, the other that it is structured like a fractal. Here we suggest that both theories are true, and we can resolve the issue by adopting the dual aspect viewpoint of Plato-Leibniz that there are two simultaneous universes that correspond to each other, like the two side of a coin. One is the universe of Platos Mind (the One), the other is Leibnizs universe of Monads (the Many), where the One creates, perceives and controls the Many. According to these two aspects, conceptually the universe is a hologram, but physically it is a fractal. Both theories envision an infinity in a speck. This can be so if the speck is Leibnizs monad, in which the infinity on the mental side is a hologram, and in which the infinity of the physical side is a fractal.edit: personally, i'm hoping i'll find a strong/entertaining connection to simulation theory, which i'm heavily biased towards. it just happens to explain a lot of modern "weird" science in the most comprehensible way. logically i get that that has no bearing on how likely a theory is to be true...but practically, i wouldn't be interested if i couldn't understand a theory.
<|endoftext|>I have found no greater metaphysical teacher than Scott Mandelker. On his website,  you can find many free and illuminating essays on the mechanics of consciousness.On his youtube page,  you can find hours and hours of talks on various metaphysical topics, namely his dissection of The Ra Material/The Law of One.
<|endoftext|>Its interesting that this is the round table for this time. Everything is lining up. It is my true belief that people are waking up, that we will see how holographic our world truly is. I feel as though consciousness is a shared experience. Like if our world was created like how we dream up our dreams. But instead of one person, its everything coming together to make reality. 
<|endoftext|>Oh boy, have I got some theories here! As far as conspiracies go, and as far as my research so far has taken me, I truly think that consciousness - or suppression thereof - is "the big one". The end of the rabbit hole for some... (until you realise the rabbit hole is fractal in nature and never ending). But yeah, I've got a bit of an essay on this I wanted to share. I'll try and include as much source and reference material as I can, but if anyone else has more to add then I only encourage it. **Holographic Universe:** Mainly referencing the fractal-holographic theory of Nassim Haramein, the fractal-holographic theory essentially suggests that the universe is, at a fundamental level, made up of 'bits' of information, and that the information of the entire system is fractally encoded at every point through harmonic layering/nesting. Much like how DNA, a chemical compound within every single cell of a body, contains the information to recreate the entire human. A great metaphor to describe this is the Sutra of "Indra's Net": *"Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each "eye" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering "like" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring."* In this metaphor the jewels represent protons. Nassim Haramein tackled what's known as the 'vacuum catastrophe' (a mathematical problem that arises when you add up the number of vacuum fluctuations in a unit of space, as the mass that is calculated comes out absurdly larger than that which is actually measured in that same unit of space - for example: when adding up the vacuum fluctuations in a cubic centimetre of space you yield 10^93 grams, whereas if you were to take all the measurable mass of the observable universe and squish it into that same space you'd get 10^55 grams) by figuring out how we can derive the mass of matter from the fundamental planck unit. When you divide the volume of a proton by the volume of a planck sphere unit (a spherical unit of energy of planck length diameter, proposed by Nassim to be one of these fundamental 'bits' of information that make up the universe) and then multiply by the planck mass, you come out with the mass of the observable universe: 10^55 grams. This shows that the exact amount of vacuum fluctuations that fit into a proton - when the planck spheres are stacked in a 3 dimensional ["flower of life" formation]( (as opposed to being stacked in a [cubic]( formation) - equals the measurable mass of the observable universe. But obviously that's not what we see when we measure the mass of a proton. Due to the size:mass ratio of the proton it fulfills the Schwartzschild condition for a black hole. Once we consider the proton to act as a black hole we can borrow a mathematical concept from string theory - the holographic principle - which states that the surface information of a black hole can encode the volume information. When you apply this, and divide the surface planck spheres by the volume planck spheres and then multiply by the planck mass, you arrive at the measured proton's rest mass of ~10^-24 grams. Each proton in the universe holographically contains the information of every other proton in the universe. And every surface planck sphere of every acts as a wormhole terminations which connect all protons via a superfluid/superconducting aether, allowing instantaneous information transfer between all protons via an instantaneous information feedback-loop network. *It's this universal instantaneous feedback-loop network that gives rise to consciousness at a universal scale.* And from there, due to the fractal self-configuring/self-evolving nature of the system, consciousness evolves to form higher and higher orders of self-complexity within the system. For more information visit the /r/holofractal subreddit, from which I've taken taken this info and condensed it for this post (big shoutout and serious thanks to the admin of that sub /u/d8_thc for being such a good communicator of this information), and have a read of the stickied posts and links in the sidebar. Also here's Nassim Haramein's "The Connected Universe" [2015 lecture]( on the subject. Here's his "The Connected Universe" [2017 documentary]( (narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart). And here's one of his papers on the subject: ["The Unified Spacememory Network: From Cosmogenesis to Consciousness"]( 
<|endoftext|>I have nothing to really add. I'm new-ish to reddit I'm pretty much as my username states, lol. At least, when it comes to these matters. Sounds incredibly fascinating but these are things that I know very little about. Here to soak up all the cool info. :)
<|endoftext|>Great topic! I'm inclined to believe there's something holographic and fractal about our universe that mainstream physics misses. I'm even inclined to believe that "consciousness"/awareness is primal to matter, or maybe inextricably linked to matter. My issue is that there are a lot of charlatans in this field of discussion, and a lot more people who make claims which I'm sure they think are right, but can't back up. In some ways, it's hard to say whether a lot of these things *can* be backed up in any substantial way, even if they are true. We're talking about the very substrate upon which everything we know and experience is based. I think Something like Gdel's Incompleteness Theorem for metaphysics has to apply. Specifically, I see a lot of these youtube videos which make grand claims and back them up only with hand waving, or references to "inspired" texts. It strikes me as very similar to the way that the ancient religions operate, basically appeals to authority. If anyone has any good reading or videos that approach this topic in a more rigorous way, I'd love to see them. I find things much more convincing when people only claim the patterns they observe, rather than claiming they're the ones with the "One Truth." I see u/Illuminati_LCO recommended Scott Mandelker, and I'll definitely check him out. Any others?

<|endoftext|>Also see /r/paradigmchange/ I am a major in Physics, and became sensitive for the paranormal a bit after my studies. Since then I am studying the aura and chi, and try to put it into scientific concepts. The major problem with science today is that it it does not like new ideas. The model that I observe is that there are more dimensions. This is physically possible without any problems. The physical body is surrounded by an multidimensional aura. It works like a second body. The aura is observable as a flame-like body. What you are observing is the chi / life-energy flowing through the body. But if you follow the flow, it follows a line-structure. These lines are known in the yoga as nadis, but this repeats on all dimensions. Everything is connected with each other trough these lines/channels. At certain places they connect with each other and go through nodes, which act like ports to the next level of the aura.Each level of the aura goes deeper into a unity of consciousness. Be aware: there are many levels of this unity, and that can be confusing as the religions show us. The different levels connect unity all the way to our physical body.Now it is interesting that we see this same structure back in our body. Within our cells we have microtubules that control/guide processes in the cells, and communication between cells.It seems that these processes and communication can be disturbed with electromagnetic waves, when they are in resonance with it. But that is a whole other story on its own.On lower level we see that molecules are connected via electrons. And on the deepest known level the quarks are connected via gluons. There seem to be 2 more physical levels, but that needs some more research.The multidimensional network model, based on observations, connects consciousness and physics in one model. In this model we have some kind of free will, as we experience, and can consciousness influence the physical body as we can observe. Also can physical substances influence the psyche. It goes both ways.With this model, I can understand most psychiatric problems. Your consciousness can have problems on different levels of existence. I am now actively helping people with severe problems like psychosis and depression. I also get insight in how psychopaths work, and how we can help them and us with this disease.The multidimensional models can also explain all paranormal events that I know exist. Ghosts can move in and out of our physical observed dimension. Probably there are many more multidimensional creatures. We can influence (with enough training) the physical world that we connect with. I can heat something with my hands. There are also tricksters that try to pretend they can do these things, so it is best to learn it yourself via chi.But there is also the problem with sceptics. They seem to be very afraid of the multidimensional aspect of this reality. I usually see that they have problems with some multidimensional beings that parasite on them and their thinking. And from this fear and problems they react aggressively towards these ideas. Tip: Just have an open mind, explore these ideas and find out for yourself.
<|endoftext|>is anyone into leibniz's stuff? or mike hockney? i feel like there's never anyone around to help me digest their ideas...also not entirely sure if their ideas fit here.
<|endoftext|>Thank you for choosing the topic I suggested! I've got some shit to talk about with this, but I'll go in later on when I've finished work and have time. Dis gon be good!
<|endoftext|>Just wondering what people here make of Nassim Harramein and his documentary The Connected Universe. I have interest in his unified theory of physics, and his formula that calculates the density of the atom being equal to the density of a black hole is intriguing. I also find his theory that at the center of everything is a black hole (planets, stars, etc.) and even atoms themselves are black holes, as well as our entire universe being inside of a black hole. As someone who follows the cospiracy world though, i'm aware that his information seems to be a bit like a new age religion in a way. The oneness of his philosophy also raises red flags to me being aware of the many one world new world order conspiracy theories. Thoughts?
<|endoftext|>This is the stuff I love to read and talk about and not too long ago act on... I've posted this before but I truly had a few profound experiences/intuitions (starting with an intense mushroom trip) that lead me to do something unexpected, selfless, outrageous, seemingly nonsensical and against my own self interests . Just to upset the balance and see what would happen. The proverbial "drop in the bucket" that filled the vessel to the brim and made the waves that spilled over out over the edge. I kicked a hornets nest. I contended with the forces that were messing with the natural order. It's hard to explain and honestly I can barely comprehend what happened. It's the kind of stuff that drives you and others mad. Psychosis. Neurosis. That's the thing about "making waves" or "shaping reality". The waves invariably come back at you and out in ways you can't predict and might not be able to handle or even understand. Which is why most sheeple will never make a big enough impact to affect reality either subtly or overtly. And even when you succeed it's hard to see the connection or the big picture... Let alone The unseen world and dimensions that surround us. It's the grandest version of "thinking outside the box".After I did my deed I was literally attacked by shadow entities twice and approached (edit: more like questioned/interrogated) by men in black type federal agents who asked if I was a terrorist. Not long after that Trump was elected president (for good or ill). I know it sounds absolutely insane but I feel like what I did contributed to Hillary Clinton losing. Chaos theory and the butterfly effect. The divine masculine putting a smack down on the toxic feminine/nihilism/dogmatism that pervades the west. Like after my little escapade the whole world started to wake up/go crazy. 
<|endoftext|>Here's my theory. It's not one of a conspiracy, but more of theory that may offer some lose explanation of other theories. These may just be the ramblings of an armchair physicist, but I think there is something significant in this theory.Our brains mostly operate at a quantum level, mainly by transferring standing waves and states.  It has always seemed like our brains are capable of more than they seem to be, which are chemical calculators. My theory is that memory and conscience are occurring at a quantum level above the electrical signals passed between synapses. Those electro-chemical signals merely act as activators to kick off quantum state transitions.  The problem lies in that it would be really really hard to observe these changes.Why is this relevant to conspiracies? I think it makes a lot of progress in giving credence to unexplained phenomena as it opens a new pathway into understanding altered mind states, ESP, and much more.  
<|endoftext|>Sweet! This should be a fun one. If UFOs (not of our own making) are real, then they are no doubt interdimensional and a huge supporting factor to the holographic universe 
<|endoftext|>We are living in the age of Aquarius. The sign that sun rises on the vernal equinox. If we can learn anything from our past this next 2100 years will be full of flooding. This is not a sign of global warming as it's pronounced on local media. Our polar caps are shifting faster than our land moves because of centerfugal forces on the crust and our wobble will push them more towards the equator. Luckly our current revolution around the sun won't cause a flash freezing like the former ice age. These are all told by your ancient ancestors in long legends through time. Your place in history will not be from a blog. Think grandeur.

<|endoftext|>I highly recommend reading the kybalion, the Ra Material (Law of One), and some study of Neoplatonic philosophy. I think the radio analogy of consciousness is helpful, we tune into the dimension we choose out of all the multitude of interdimensional frequencies available. Another analogy is the slideshow of dimensions we pass through that string together into a continuity of experience, when the slides don't line up we have a discontinuity of experience like the Mandela effect. You choose to tune into or put the next slide in, and there is limitless potential for what you may choose, you just may be choosing a reality in which you have less control or things aren't as whacky as I'm describing, and the moment you choose to accept that or open yourself to the possibility things begin to change. (Some of these concepts are described by Bashaar the channeled entity)

<|endoftext|>I want to believe this so bad, and I have an open mind, but there's several big problems that make it implausible... For instance, there is an annoying amount of literature on this subject (see the comments below for example), yet never have I seen someone, on youtube, reddit or whatever, who could actually DO something so outrageous as shaping reality. Surely if the premise is true, and the literature supporting it as well, there must exist SOMEONE who is able to do it and make a video about it, showing off his powers? In fact, it would be world news.
<|endoftext|>Having broken through the veil of reality with DMT I can confirm you are correct. All "reality" is is based on your perception. Perception is the No1 most important thing to our existance. Next is language. Language is the only way information can be transferred. But back to perception, reality is contained within our heads. We can with proper training alter reality. Now as to why no-one has come forward and showed off these powers you need to understand that every human is their own universe and that we are limited to seeing only what we are hardwired to see through our faulty senses. I'm sorry if this makes no sense but there is no language in this dimension that can describe the concepts in my head. 
<|endoftext|>Where can I read more on this? I study physics and I've come to a similar conclusion. Looking for something of substance that I can sink my teeth into, not some vague "love, peace" bullshit.
<|endoftext|>Hey, you're on point with this post. Indeed, our potential power has been consciously hidden from us throughout our existence. Check out the Gnostic mythology sometime, especially the book "Not in HIS Image" by John Lash. Also very relevant is "The Cosmic War' by Joseph Farrell. 
<|endoftext|>After about the same amount of time peering at the same stuff, I would wholeheartedly agree with this.I think that cracks are beginning to show though and once truth really starts flowing out, it'll upend everything. 
<|endoftext|> Humans are conscious beings capable of shaping reality around them. Thoughts affect reality.Unfortunately this is wrong. Human beings' consciousness affects *perspective* and how we perceive the universe. It doesn't alter reality, it alters our perception of reality.There is only one point in modern physics where perception directly effects reality where data mirrors the perspective change - in Quantum Perception (Wave-Particle Matter States).Thats a *huge* marked difference from what you're opening with, which makes the chain of logic after it dubious, since its forumated on an incorrect notion.
<|endoftext|>Dig deeper man. Some CIA docs showed they already have a grand unified theory of reality. At the base of a pyramid you have energy = mass = information. At the top connecting all 3 like a pyramid is consciousness. So consciousness = energy, mass, and information. Literally this information is available, I'll let you know what keywords to search for. 
<|endoftext|>Beautifully said. It goes beyond just hiding knowledge though, our society is a minefield of sometimes subtle and many times harsh penalties for straying away from constrained thinking and being.
<|endoftext|>Humans are conscious beings capable of shaping reality around themI want to believe this. So bad. Lets use Hillary Clinton as an example. One of the most powerful and well connected people in the world. If knowledge of this existed, surely someone like her would have knowledge of it and use it to their advantage aka becoming president and shaping her reality. She was just a general example, but there must be other forces at bay here because some of us cant construct our reality no matter how strong our thoughts.

This they will never know.The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late.Oh yes, so grand the illusion of their freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves.When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them.This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion.When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin.Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial.But if they ever find out they are our equal, we shall perish then. THIS THEY MUST NEVER KNOW.If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action.They must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen. Our actions will have revealed who we are and they will hunt us down and no person shall give us shelter.This is the secret covenant by which we shall live the rest of our present and future lives, for this reality will transcend many generations and life spans.This covenant is sealed by blood, our blood. We, the ones who from heaven to earth came.This covenant must NEVER, EVER be known to exist.

<|endoftext|>**The Mechanics of Consciousness:** Here's some more relevant links which I believe are must-watch/must-reads for diving into the topic. ["Itzhak Bentov: from Atom to Cosmos"]( - a video which starts for the first 20 minutes with an interview between Hubert Jessup and Itzhak Bentov from 1978 on the show "New Heaven New Earth". He explains during this interview the concept of the soul as: "the repository of information that we gather during life" and that the soul uses a 3d body much like a person uses a car to get from one point to another. He says that it isn't the body which evolves, but the soul that does, and that from information gathered during the lives it lives it can evolve and form deeper and more complex understandings of self over time. At one point he uses a diagram to explain the [inherent connection between all people on the soul level]( using one line with individual, separate dots on it to represent humans on a 3D level, and then extending out lines upward, likening them to shadows being projected when a light is shone on an object, to represent the extended consciousness of the individuals. The shows that at a point, the next level up on the next line, representing 4D, all the consciousnesses of all individuals overlap and become the same thing, showing how the higher up you go the more the overlap. The following 1 hour and 20 minutes of the video is comprised of a presentation by Itzhak's wife Mirtala going over and explaining many ideas and concepts Itzhak explored in his books "Stalking the Wild Pendulum" and "A Brief Tour of Higher Consciousness", such as: The Model of Kundalini, Off and On Reality, The Hologram, and A Cosmic Strip - 'Who Runs the Show'. (Edit: just wanted to add a link to a comment I made the other day on the concept of "levels" oh conscious self in conjuction with each dimension.  Another paper, this time from the CIA, ["Analysis and Assessment of the Gateway Process"]( as part of Project Stargate (/r/ProjectSTARGATE). This paper directly references the work of Itzhak Bentov and the Robert Monroe, utilizing the Monroe Tapes as released by the Monroe Institute for research into biofeedback, out of body experiences, consciousness, kundalini, meditation + transcendental experiences, holographic universe, astral projection, remote viewing, and time travel. And another video of a lecture from Rupert Sheldrake in 2008 entitled ["The Extended Mind: Recent Experimental Evidence"]( In this 1 and a half hour talk he gives evidence for and expands upon concepts such as synchronicity and psychic/telepathic connection between events and people. Some examples he explores are the feeling of being watched (such as when you feel like someone's staring at you, and you turn around and someone actually was), thinking about someone you haven't thought about in a long time and then they call you, or thinking about something you haven't done in a while and it pops up in your life very soon after, and the psychic connection between an owner and their pet and how the pet often knows when the owner is coming home from work, even when the owner randomises the times in which they leave work to come home. I also would recommend the books by Rupert Sheldrake: "Science and Spiritual Practices", and ""Morphic Resonance: The Nature of Formative Causation" In a similar vein, I also want to include a 2 hour talk from [Dan Winter on DNA, Fractals, and the Golden Ratio]( Dan Winter has often worked with Nassim Haramein and they've bounced ideas off each other. He's no stranger to the holographic theory and offers some very insightful theories. Here's a analogy I particularly like to use when talking about the relationship between humans and consciousness: *"The radio:"* There's multiple concepts of self. The "self" built up over the accumulation of experiences in life can be referred to as "ego self". It's temporary. "True self/higher self" is awareness, which acts as conscious wave function that the body tunes into, much like a radio tuning into a certain frequency. When the relationship and interaction between the body consciousness and universal consciousness occurs an interference pattern is created and the wave function collapses and forms a relative consciousness experiencing within time. The functioning human is a symbiotic relationship of hardware (body) and signal (mind), like a functioning radio. The radio needs a power source (batteries/electrical input) just like the human body does (food/water). The radio can be turned on without tuning into a frequency, but that doesn't make it functioning, similarly to how a human can exist on body function alone but without conscious action (like a comatose state). Each radio has its own individual circuit board, speakers, functions etc and all to varying qualities, just like a human has its own bodily functions and systems all to varying degrees of functionality. But they all tune into the same frequency. How it comes out simply varies from radio to radio based on its components and settings, like how consciousness expresses itself differently depending on how the person functions and their respective conditioning. The radio was only invented because radio waves were discovered as an existing phenomena that could be tuned into to and used to communicate information. Similarly to how the human only evolved because conscious awareness existed as a field of potential to tune into and express itself/transfer information. I like the radio analogy, but it only works so far. The human brain is more like a quantum computer, operating multiple functions simultaneously, whereas a radio has a relatively straight forward and discrete function. So a quantum radio in which multiple functions were occurring simultaneously and where the radio was self-aware would be a more accurate analogy... But for obvious reasons that's not a useful analogy when explaining the concept to those unfamiliar with it. (This analogy was lifted from a comment I left in a thread the other day which I think had some good discussion in, so [here's the link to that full thread]( is not a new concept. [David Icke was talking about this concept back in 1991, and theoretical physicists have since come to the same conclusion as Michio Kaku explains in 2008](
<|endoftext|>Never heard of this guy, but if he actually measured the masses of protons in grams rather than eV, that alone is super suspect. Interesting idea though. 
<|endoftext|>Why are you equating the proton with the Planck volume? The proton is not an elementary particle, it is a mix of 3 quarks. And even then, elementary particles are not even real, theyre simply excited states of a universal quantum field. Not totally discounting everything you said, though. The entire universe is just a field of constantly fluctuating energy, so it is totally possible that consciousness is linked in some way to this. One document I read on the cia website stated that we are able to do those special things with our consciousness when we get the field surrounding our neurons into its rest state. Then you like merge with the universal consciousness, which is really just the combined rest state energies of the universe (the energy fluctuations that do NOT give particles). Dont have the link handy atm, but Ive seen it on this sub more than once so maybe someone could help out. It was about the Stargate program I believe, and outlined a lot of their findings from theoretical physics and consciousness experiments. It was listed as a disclosed document from the CIA, so it seems fairly legit. Interesting read. Also had something about someone remote viewing a civilization on Mars, way in the past. So anyways, apparently were able to access a universal consciousness through deep meditation and probably psychedelics.

<|endoftext|>Easier alternative to accomplish what, specifically? Really. Id like to answer your question(s) without including things youve zero interest in.

<|endoftext|>well despite the machinations of the nwo science does show us that the universe is connected almost in a spiritual buddhist kinda way. think of our planet and how our brains and hearts are wired. our brains and hearts give off electromagnetic pulses. given that every single human being on earth has their brain and heart pulsing within the medium of our planets electromagnetic field i dont think its much of a stretch to say we're all connected through that. also electrons and photons do wacky things at the planck/quantum scale. they can be in multiple places at once. in some cases electrons can move seemingly instantaneously, faster than light! electrons also behave very similarly to black holes and are subject to the same fundamental properties of mass, charge and spin. as far as a grand unifying theory of everything i stopped searching for one after reading the mathematical universe by max tegmark. amazing book that puts a lot of sooper complex sounding stuff in laymens terms. basically he postulates that everything in the universe is math and as such can be broken down into equations(e=mc^2), numbers(pi, e, i, etc) or values (mass, spin, charge) of some kind. ill def check out the connected universe tho, sounds interesting

Are you sure you aren't actually schizophrenic? 
<|endoftext|>They are no doubt interdimensional. Id say theres some doubt, considering our concept of other dimensions is only founded on only one possible explanation from the findings of quantum mechanics, that is the most far out there of the theres popular interpretations. 
<|endoftext|>There are actually a number of videos on Youtube of people practicing telekinesis and showing off various powers. In the modern day and age, there is no way to vouch that such things are not created through CGI or other forms of video manipulation. Thus eveyone and their mother can go and call it fake.Is some of it likely fake? Sure. Is all of it? I doubt it.Throughout history there have been plenty of people that are said to have had miracolous powers to shape the holographic reality around them. Out of the more well known ones, I could simply mention Jesus or the Buddha. People will say their miracles are myths and legends. Yet who is to say they were not reality?These are extreme examples, but if you want small time miracles like bending spoons... there are plenty of people that have done it, as well as videos that exist of it. Uri Geller was one of those that was more well known in this field. All of these could and many times were called fake, but whether they actually are, or whether this is only propaganda smeared on their name is a question we should all ponder.Ultimately, if someone could truly perform masive miracles, they would likely not do it public. This is simply because doing such things is pointless. Performing miracles for a public that is not ready to see them is a bad idea. This is especially the case when it comes from a place of ego - and know that ego, self -importance, pride and a feeling of superiority are the greatest obstacles to performing miracles in the first place. By performing them, you would simply be boosting your own ego and thus lower your spiritual power and prowess as you would do so.Not to mention that unless you were truly Goku level powerful, performing miracles in public and claiming yourself as a Godlike being could easily get you lynched. Have you seen the X-Men movies? Even the humans in those movies with unbelievable powers cannot simply express them without fear of some retribution from the powers that be and without being labeled a "mutant" or even a "demon" by the ignorant public.Spirituality never is and never was about performing miracles. Yes, molding your holographic reality is a part of it, but doing so in our world, where nobody is ready for this, is literally toying with people (that is to say, unless you intuitively know that you should perform such acts, intuition is the inner and cosmic guidance system that will tell you what to do qnd what not do - as well as what is safe and appropriate to do on our planet) .But ultimately spirituality is about being free and knowing your intertwinement and unity with Source/Life or God. The moment you start performing miracles from a place of ego, you are no longer under the protection of God or Life, because you have decided to use the power given to you irresponsibly, without heeding the fact that you should never simply unwittingly perform miracles for a populace that is so deeply asleep and doesn't desire to be jolted awake into a crazy reality beyond their imagination. They like being asleep and until the collective wakes up, who are you or I to jolt them awake? They need tiny nudges here and there, compassion and love - and even then they must be ready for the ride.I myself have experienced various things that many could label miraculous. Feeling my body as pure energy, knowing myself as the being, consciousness and freedom beyond the body and mind, experiencing the ability to step into another's biofield and read their thoughts, feel their feelings (this is nothing special or new, many psychics and energy therapists do this all the time, some of them are of course charlatans, but they only give a bad name to those that truly can help in such a way - ultimately though if you are very aware, you will see that everyone does this to some degree, people read each other's minds and emotions all the time, yet they assume this is only related to the physical realm of reading bodylanguage, vocal tonality ....when it is far beyond that and can be evolved far beyond that) - as well as having people do the same to me (which was all done in the form of therapy, that greatly helped me in regaining my physical and mental well-being after a deep dive into hell many years ago).Ultimately, you will have to experience these "miracles" for yourself. Practice meditation, introspect, look into various spiritual practices and intuitively choose what you feel will guide you to freedom. You can and you have to do it yourself, for it is your personal journey, as much as it is at the same time the collective journey of all of us.For some wonderful and almost unbelievable examples of miracles, or Siddhis, as they are called in the east, check out the book 'Autobiography of a Yogi', by Yogananda. It is one of the most well known spiritual pieces of literature and likely the most known spiritual autobiography to date. From people becoming invisible, materializing their bodies miles away, even creating buildings out of thin air.... the stuff in that book is just something else. But in a holographic Universe, none of this is really a miracle. Only to us, at this point of our evolution. Yogananda writes in a very loving, amusing, fun, even humorous fashion, so the book flows easily. The various miracles aren't really the main focus of the book either, they are simply parts of stories here and there, after all this is supposed to be an autobiography, not a book that proves or wishes to prove miraculous happenings.

<|endoftext|>It is true, but it isnt X-men style telekinesis! TBH, the most information you will find is actually about the *negative uses* of this effect. Read about how psychopaths manipulate people or how charismatic cult leaders recruit followers. This is manipulation of reality, but you must understand that a persons *perception of reality is reality*. Generally, the negative uses, which are the simpler order, do so by *subtraction*. That is, removing complexity or conflicting views from a discussion to the point that the target internalizes this subtraction. Examples are propaganda from the media, political campaigns, con artists, and even people who make conspiracy theories!The basic way this works is to present an answer for the complex and difficult to understand things about the world in a reductive and simplistic way by removing from discussion anything which would bring this answer under scrutiny. (Russian bots or paid shills are a contemporary and relevant example of how this in practice). It allows the target to make judgements on *simple* criteria which appeal due to the simplicity and comprehensiveness of the reality which the manipulator creates for them. There is an NWO which controls all nations and hides tech and does *everything* under a grand design for domination. Is much more comprehensible, and understandable, thus actionable as the basis for a belief system than Global politics and events are shaped by millions of self-interested people and groups and most of the time one doesnt know what another is doing and often doesnt even fully understand what they themselves are doing, and it is more amazing that a cohesive system manages to exist from this chaos and turmoil at all.The first statement uses subtractive manipulation of reality to provide a simple answer and is thus attractive to people. When they internalize this belief, they begin to reinforce it by interpreting all future events within this belief system and thus acting on that judgement. The perception of reality has *become* reality!One can also manipulate reality for more altruistic ends in similar manners and more complex ones. The basic idea is that he person who wants to shape reality must craft a *vision of reality* which others wish to enter and share. Think about Jesus or Buddha or even Elon Musk. They all present visions of reality for (mostly) non-malicious purposes which people find attractive and so abandon their own perceptions of it to adopt the one presented.
<|endoftext|>Here's how it works.1) the multiverse is real. Not only is the universe infinitely large and small, its also infinitely "wide"2) every time determinism splits with an equal probability, so too does the universe3) you are conscious of only the current universe4) but you can hop on to the other universes each time a split happens5) think of "you" as merely the guy viewing the tv behind your eyes and you can switch channels6) this only works gradually and logically, you can't just imagine you'll have wings and voila. As per (4) each shift can only happen when it's just as likely for either result to occur.You can completely disagree, but that just means you'll randomly go along with each split randomly and live a life of random success/failures.On the other hand, you can believe you really do control your fate and move the needle in your favour every chance you recognize you have a choice.This, my friends, is how freewill works in a completely deterministic universe.I personally believe that this is why my mother somehow ended up living an extra year and saw my daughter be born before she finally passed on. But more practically, this is also why I've got a successful career, because every time I felt like slacking off I decided NOT to live in the universe where I did. That universe does exist out there, but I'm glad I'm not tuned into it.The shifts aren't a physical action, they're completely mental. Think about this. Move your hand on your head. Did your brain first have to decide to do that or did your hand just do it? You shifted your universe into the one where your hand is now on your head. Think about this deeply. Consciousness is merely witnessing your choices. You don't control your body, just the channel you're viewing..So now some are probably about to ask why bad stuff happens to us, if we control reality. Easy. We DON'T CONTROL REALITY. I never once said we did. Anyway you look at it, we're just along for the ride. The only control we have is when the odds are 50/50 for things to go one way or another. If the odds are 80/20 that something bad will happen, something bad is almost certainly going to happen. But when it does, keep your eyes open even then, as the 50/50 options are even more abundant in the midst of a crisis if you can only keep your wits and emotions in check. 
<|endoftext|>You see people shaping reality every day. You are shaping your every day, by yourself. Through your actions and your being. Or not?
<|endoftext|>Have a DMT breakthrough sometime and you'll start believing in the power of us all to do truly extraordinary things.
<|endoftext|>I don't think it's shaping reality as in making an object fly, but more so controlling where you go in life and attracting things into your life. 
<|endoftext|>Your favorite musician or author or director HAS shaped your reality. What would your reality look like without them? 
<|endoftext|>The reality you are creating before you will not allow you to see someone breaking rules that you hold to be true. Basically, you're not letting your reality's "rules" be broken because it's not relevant/logical to you.... Yet ;)
<|endoftext|>Shaping reality in this sense isnt a spontaneous occurrence. Theres a saying that goes something likeif you did it right, no one will know you did anything at all. Its a subtle change that manifests. Its luck, chance, unlikely outcomes, overcoming the odds, etc. It doesnt mean you can grow a tree with your mind. It just means you can influence the word you live in through sheer will and brain power. 
<|endoftext|>Just wanted to pop in with a comment on this. I once heard a story about natives standing on the shore, unable to see the approaching invading ships because their minds had nothing to reference the image against. Who's to say that you haven't ALREADY seen someone shape reality, but your mind justified it away. How many times have you seen something and couldn't make it out until enough information became available and then BAM the image snaps into focus? I personally believe that I affect my reality constantly, but in ways that most wouldn't notice. Small things, like transmuting a shitty situation into a gain. Some might think it was just good timing and planning, but in reality its a lot simpler than that. 
<|endoftext|>I think the issue is that given specific thinking, or knowledge, you can do really crazy stuff, for example create a bacteria which generates a particular reaction after X amount of time, this bacteria would be encoded in DNA that is made of atoms, which are themselves standing 3D waves of energy. So if you can move energy intelligently from point A to point B instantly, it opens up a lot of possibilities. Can you engineer a fleet of comets into something living? And i think those type of questions can very quickly appear "godlike" but on the surface appear mundane
<|endoftext|>This is why I wanted a new thread on the multitude Mind Experiments from the CIA and other agencies to be discussed next. Some of the stuff in the released docs is mind blowing. I am a believer in something out there, especially after my experiences with DMT. The one thing that really flipped me out on it was when 2 of the people I was with the last time I used it met each other in their "trip". 
<|endoftext|>From my perspective. we do this already. We can't know what a reality outside of the way we experience time would look like, But if we could look at a persons life as pages in a book all visible at once then we would clearly see a person "manipulating reality". Just because you haven't seen someone materialize something in front of you doesn't mean we aren't moving, manipulating, and creating everything as we go. It's just hard for the individual to see the long game. It has been for me anyways..
<|endoftext|>You're thinking about it far too literally I think. Shaping your own reality can simply be the power to get yourself out of bed and smile at someone as you walk down the street. Those positive interactions create ripple effects that can have consequences far beyond what you ever be able to measure - even if those consequences might seem relatively small and insignificant in the present moment. I think we'd all like a world where we can move mountains just by willing it, but to get to that point (if it's actually possible) requires a foundational understanding of how you practice your own abilities on yourself. It starts with getting a handle on how you react to your own emotions. The easiest example is someone cutting you off in traffic. In that moment you are flooded with emotion and your next move is really just a reflection of what type of "spell" you're casting on yourself. A bad spell would lead to anger and frustration whereas a positive spell would lead to complete ambivalence. The magick that is often talked about can be translated to psychological language as well.Shaping your reality means identifying something that you'd like to do or change and having the mental ability and energy to actually make it happen.
<|endoftext|>I asked the universe for a Fox to appear. I live in an area were there are foxes but I never really see them. Two weeks later behind the 15th green a fox was just chilling out looking at me, not scared and never moved. Probably a coincidence, but it was cool I gotta try it again soon.    The only videos were I went WTF is that asian healer dude someone posted [Chi master Dynamo Jack](
<|endoftext|>The first step to free yourself from this trap is to *fully understand and accept* that there is no truth, the entire manipulation is based on making people *think that there is a truth and that it is being withheld from them*. When one realizes that the Egyptian priest class had no more knowledge about the Gods than the average slave (or that a politician knows no more about the whole system than you do) suddenly their vast power is rendered into human frailty, and their motives are equally understandable by mundane human desires.The illusion of a secret truth is the core of the deception, the heart of the con. For them to have true power over you, you must believe that they have access to truths which you do not. This is the *secret knowledge* of the Mystery Schools; they are exactly the same as Scientology! *This* is what is revealed at the highest levels! That there *is no Wizard of Oz* just a man behind a curtain and all the rituals and pretense are part of the deception. The reason it is sounds boring and almost false to you now, is because the initiate of the mystery school who reaches that level and has that revealed to them *has spent their lives* believing the con and watching it employed on others and so has a *visceral understanding* of this power rather than an outsider thinking So it is all a lie? How disappointing! The initiate has the understanding of how to *employ* this knowledge.
<|endoftext|>You do shape the world by thinking! Just not on an empirically understandable way, it is just one more force in a system of infinite complexity.You have surely, at some point, seen studies where brainwaves are measured with electrodes, right? Well, consider that... if a sensor can measure the electrical activity of the mind, then clearly that electrical activity, however slight, has an effect on the world outside of ones skull. Through butterfly effects of chain reactions, mere thoughts *do indeed* shape reality.This is fact, not magic. If the mind did not affect reality, MEG and EEG would not be possible.
<|endoftext|>With respect brother I disagree. The more I read into it the more karma seems like a debt system created to trap us. Karma means something is owed, but owed to whom? Each other? If forgiveness is a virtue no one owes anyone else anything. Additionally read into myths about mystics of the past who could create buildings of stone out of thought. I believe we very much are magicians wrapped up in illusion as you said, the whole point of this society has been to convince us otherwise to the point where this notion is so ridiculous to most of us that we could never accept that it isn't the case. Our own thoughts and beliefs define the reality around us and for almost all of us that reality is that we are purely physical creatures who can do nothing but daydream. 
<|endoftext|>Escaping karma sounds alot like "The cremation of care". The ruling class are ahead of us it seems..
<|endoftext|>He may have a point to an extent think of psychosomatic processes in our bodies. People have literally thought that they were sick or take a sugar pill and depending on the former their bodies might mimic some of its own symptoms and the latter with people being relieved of some symptoms of an ailment they may have even if temporarily.
<|endoftext|>Makes absolute sense to me. I have a feeling that once we get to the point where reality can be altered in a perceivable way to others in a way where you could 'show off', that showing off like that is no longer on your list of priorities. I think that ego centric thinking is a huge roadblock to doing stuff like that.Edit: In terms of the shared reality aspect I could go into great length about that. I think that altering the reality of another requires their consent, in that they have to believe you can. A good example, the reason the wealthy elite always seem to win is because everyone thinks that's reality. We think that's the way it should be, which allows them to manifest reality in that way.
<|endoftext|>I have yet to see anything about "proper training" other than talk of such. I am interested in this topic and I have had experiences throughout my life which lead me towards believing in this stuff but everybody keeps talking about how it's definitely possible and how this and that person has written a book about it but they never say how to at least start on your path to fully understanding and delving into it.
<|endoftext|>*Tantra Illuminated* by Christopher Wallis is a good start for fundamentals of consciousness. In fact old Hinduism is a good place to begin looking into the subject. But unfortunately there isn't one particular book, just a general area you have to start looking into. I will say that the subreddit r/Echerdex is a terrific source of knowledge for the beginning of a spiritual journey, have a look there and see if it sparks your interest :).The law of one series is also incredibly interesting on this matter.
<|endoftext|>Check out "DMT: The Spirit Molecule" by Rick Strassman and "The Invisible Landscape" by Terence and Dennis McKenna.
<|endoftext|>Tantric Hinduism is a good start. It's not all just sex stuff like the media would have you believe it's about the fundamentals of consciousness. There is a religious twist to it of course but it's easy enough to read between the lines. Another source I highly recommend is the Law of One books. Go into it with a cautiously skeptical outlook but read it and see what you make of it. 
<|endoftext|>forumated on an incorrect notionWith all due respect mate, you cannot make that call. In fact the entire point of what I was saying is that society has been twisted so we think precisely the way you do. If you have never seen or experienced anything that makes you believe humans can alter reality around them then that is very understandable, but some of us have. Please don't take this as a personal attack, I'm more just pointing out that this is not something you can be certain about at all. And keeping your mind closed about it like that is the goal of TPTB. 
<|endoftext|>There's a lot of evidence of occult shit going down in Little Rock where her and Bill are from. Apparently energic leylines also pass through there. I would argue she is very aware of it but like I said it's still a shared reality and you can't always have it your way ;). 
<|endoftext|>Julian Assange put a stop to her reality.But it couldn't have happened without a *hero's journey*.
<|endoftext|>I think there is definitely a deliberate and concentrated campaign to weaken that aspect of the human being. 
<|endoftext|>the latest in a long line of efforts to suppress global paradigm shifting technology. the downvotes MUST mean im on to somethin lol the thread i made keeps fluctuating the votes. everytime i look at it its a different number between 6 and 9. smells like botwork
<|endoftext|>it could still get you to space ,and around earth, easier and cheaper than a rocket. if it works scaled up that is. conventional thrusters or an ion engine (ion engines and ion thrusters are different) could power it in space. solar sail maybe? 
<|endoftext|>at what point do they stop caring about ruling us altogether and simply just exist as their own separate civilization? theyd probably get some ego kicks out of being able to classify themselves a new species after however many generations.
<|endoftext|>my thing is, if this technology is so simple, why are people not working on it independently of their govt? like on a local community level. theoretically i should be able to buy a neon sign transformer, some hunks of aluminum/copper and some clay and be able to atleast test this stuff. alas i am a broke bastard but surely there are people with more disposable income than i to work with. i mean no aliens any harm but i definitely didnt sign no damn contract lol
<|endoftext|>lol sweet, i should've checked this sub out earlier. honestly, a lot of his stuff is kind of hard for me to understand, and i really looked into his monadology mostly. but i've read that almost everything he put out was consistent with his own philosophy, which he basically started from scratch. might explain why his ideas seem to tie together really elegantly. what ideas of his were you into?
<|endoftext|>hah. i heard the idea the there's just one electron in all the universe with infinite speed, and it's hard to completely dismiss...
<|endoftext|>**Religion:** I've never really been devoutly religious myself. I went to a Church of England primary school from ages 5-11, so I had a decent education in Christianity, but it never really "stuck" with me. I considered myself an atheist for the most part of my life. It wasn't until I discovered Buddhism and general eastern philosophy that I begun exploring that aspect of religion a few years ago. The concept of reincarnation seemed far more realistic than either eternal bliss or eternal damnation, and the concept of simply *nothing* at death didn't seem right. I strongly considered it for a while, but when I really thought about it and thought, "Well, if all of this is just meaningless then why don't I just go round killing everyone who makes my life difficult? ...Well because I don't *want* to do that. It's not right. It doesn't make me happy. I might as well just try to make the most for myself and others while I am here because that seems to be the most logical in any case." Then came the whole considering that when I die my body would just decompose and become the earth itself, so therefore my mind would probably decompose in the same way, just becoming the consciousness of the earth, the plants, the water etc... not in the self-aware way of a human mind, but rather in that inherent knowing way that things just seem to know what to do. A plant knows which way to water and light. Water knows to evaporate and condense in conjuction with temperature changes. Just like my body knows to beat pump the blood, and digest food, and convert oxygen to carbon dioxide without my thinking of it. That seemed settling. And that seemed to be what I was taking from Buddhist philosophy. That we just return to the environment and universal consciousness in that way. But then over time I started reading into conscious theories such as Nassim Haramein's, among a plethora of other information from random youtube videos and reddit posts, and it made me take a second look at it all in a new light. While at first I thought the whole "planes of existence" part of Buddhism was purely metaphorical on a personal mental level, it made me reevaluate that thought to consider them metaphors for, or likenings to, actual other physical/astral planes of existence. And then I had my first (and so far only) astral projection. I'd been practicing lucid dreaming, and wanted to see if astral projection actually had anything real to it or if it was just some form of lucid dreaming... It's not some form of lucid dreaming. It's very real. I had practiced a classic technique for a few weeks, attempting it ~4 times a week on average, and after a month or two i finally got past the "vibration stage" to the point where I felt like I got physically thrown out of my body and I found myself floating above my body in my room. I freaked out, then it felt like I got yanked back into my body as if by a rope being pulled. I sat up in shock, took a few seconds to consider what just happened, and when I came to the conclusion that all of that "nonsense" I'd been watching on youtube was actually real, well that was simply enough for me in terms of practicing astral projection. I realised it was real, and from there just decided to learn more about how it all works instead of continuing practicing it. I figured that if some spirit part of me can exist outside of my physical body then that's probably the base function of me and that this physical thing was the temporary part, so I should make the most of learning more as a physical body. I learned that the concept of multiple planes of existence was very prevalent in eastern philosophy, and that karma tended to govern where the spirit goes between lives. I learned that "higher planes" were associated with more interconnectedness, and "lower planes" were associated with more disconnectedness. And as I was learning more of the holographic theory at the same time as this all the puzzle pieces started to fall together. It's all metaphor for a holographic universe! This sent me down the pantheistic route: the idea that all religions are talking about the same thing - the same universal truth - but that over time it got warped and twisted and metaphor was used to explain abstract concepts, and that over all this time the metaphor got misinterpreted as the answer itself instead of the method to getting there. Here's a good page with some interesting reading: ["Hinduism & Quantum Physics" - The Hologram, Transcendental Meditation, Vedanta and the Synthesis of Science and Religion]( Also here's some quote from Einstein on Buddhism I came across and liked in my research: "The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism." "Among the founders of all religions in this world, I respect only one man  the Buddha. The main reason was that the Buddha did not make statements regarding the origin of the world. The Buddha was the only teacher who realised the true nature of the world. "A human being is part of the whole, called by us Universe; a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest  a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely but striving for such achievement is, in itself, a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security. 15 minute video: ["Carl Sagan on how Hindu culture is the basis for cosmic theories"]( This truth seemed much more apparent in eastern religion than in western and Abrahamic religions. But alas, I did further research. I learned of the origins of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam and how very similar they were in expressions. I was still at first off-put by the patriarchal/hierarchical structure they seemed to impose on their followers, and by the fact that they have priests who act as middlemen between the regular person and the truth. I then considered that this was by design. A corruption of the truth, in order to control the flow of information. A conspiracy (duh!). I did some re-reading on Jesus' teachings and there was one quote that really stuck with me: Luke 17:21 - "The kingdom of God will not come with observable signs. 21Nor will people say, Look, here it is, or There it is. For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst." This seemed to me like a direct reference to the holographic nature of the proton. Like DNA. The information of the whole being available at every point. All you have to do is look internally to seek the answers to the cosmos. And this new revelation (pardon the pun) of Jesus' teachings and the rest of the bible came with the discovery of the variety of ideas and philosophy that came to be known as Gnosticism. And that led me down to Knights Templar, Freemasonry, and... yeah that's a whole 'nother rabbit hole for another post. Here's a decent [forum thread that analyses some Bible quotes]( with some videos to go along explaining them in the light of holographic theory. And here's a BBC Documentary just 50 minutes long: ["Jesus Christ was a Buddhist Monk"]( 
<|endoftext|>Not measured, but calculated. It's all theoretical of course, but utilising geometry and the holographic principle, addressing the problem from a different angle, he's managed to simplify the equations. The top stickied post in the holofractal sub and the lecture I linked explain it in more detail. 
<|endoftext|>The proton has been solved for, and recently - the electron has been solved for using the same equation, [here]( is a "spherical unit of energy"? Energy does exist by itself like thatWell, there are a few ways to think about this. The mainstream has the notion of a [planck particle]( a spherical unit of energy - field energy that is massive enough to keep itself gravitationally together has been hypothesized for a while - this is the 'mass without mass' concept of John Wheeler.The spheres are [geons]( - an electromagnetic or gravitational wave which is held together in a confined region by the gravitational attraction of its own field energy.
<|endoftext|>I'm just giving the best Eli5 I can here. Please read some of the links I provided or visit the /r/holofractal subreddit for information that goes into further detail. The fractal-holographic theory isn't my own, so I'm not the best resource to explain it in its entirety. There are more qualified people than me who can do it much better. 
<|endoftext|>I'm also curious about the weak nuclear force and interaction of quarks within hadrons. I'm not sure about that yet myself. Paging /u/d8_thc - have you got any links you might be able to share in regards to this? Thank you! (also, side note: sorry I haven't made that post yet, mate. Been a busy week. I'll actually get on it this weekend haha) But yeah, /u/PackaBowllio28, I've also read those CIA documents! Very interesting stuff! The methods of transcendental experience seem to resonate very much with those described by Buddhist monks, Hindu yogis, and the like, which I go into a bit later on this post. Thanks for the input though, I appreciate it! 
<|endoftext|>We thank you for the warm welcome! Reddit is like a really cool playground for your brain. Pretty awesome!!! 
<|endoftext|>I had a short meditation the other day, of multiple dimensions or layers of myself. I was simply standing at work, been very tired lately, and felt awareness of higher and lower representations of self. Cant be exactly put into words easily.Back in the day i did some potent shrooms. It was maybe 2-2.5 hours after taking them, and i left a friends house to walk to my place only two blocks away.This was in a forest town outside of Seattle... As i walked under a tree it felt like another entity or intelligence. It frightened me because i could feel that the being in the tree seemed surprised that i noticed it. I tried to think of something else, but this entity made me experience my craziest trip, and i felt aware of other layers of reality with different looking creatures controlling what seemed like gears and machinery. Very interesting night that opened my mind. Meditation is more important than drugs.
<|endoftext|>Yeah that's what the mystics and yogis set out to achieve. Psyches I feel just make it easier for the common man to get a look into that kind perception.Seriously, I don't feel like people are understanding the gravity of the situation if it turns out that aliens are in cahoots with the guberment.If that it is indeed the case, everything we have come to understand is out the window.Personally, I think they just landed here long ago and interjected some of their DNA into ours and have us working for them. They are always watching tho :I
<|endoftext|>watch Terrence McKenna lectures on repeathe's like a walking Cliff Notes on the psychedelic experience and the lessons / questions to be asked from it edit: words
<|endoftext|>awesome. i think i remember some of that. i listened to anything available in audiobook form on youtube (most of them in a robotic australian female's voice). i think i'll try again right now.so what's your general take on mike hockney? and related ideas--meritocracy, illuminism, whatever, anything really. even if they're way off, they're so fun to think about XD
<|endoftext|> as far as a grand unifying theory of everything i stopped searching for one after reading the mathematical universe by max tegmark. amazing book that puts a lot of sooper complex sounding stuff in laymens terms. basically he postulates that everything in the universe is math and as such can be broken down into equations(e=mc2), numbers(pi, e, i, etc) or values (mass, spin, charge) of some kind.is that...not the entire basis of physics?
<|endoftext|>Odd. I'll chalk that one as Reddit acting up since idk if accounts can be temporarily unactivated. Edit: Account is active, must be the link in OP that doesn't work for some reason.
<|endoftext|>hi my first round table here. is this not happening now? no ones posting anything lol forgive my n00bness
<|endoftext|>I heard Alan Watts say something to the affect of this once, and it changed my opinion of a lot of things simultaneously. "Can you imagine how Jesus must have felt? People bowing at his feet and bringing him gifts of all kinds... knowing that they had it within themselves to do the same, since the kingdom of God was truly WITHIN. He told them this, he railed against the status quo and tried to show the people around him what they themselves might be capable of, and they thought he was some kind of God, worthy of admiration and devotion." Talk about a face palm situation.. "Hey dudes, if you practice meditation, virtue, and awareness, you can turn water into wine too!" What do they do? Bow down and show that they totally missed the point in a painfully obvious kind of way.
<|endoftext|>Thank you so much - I will read that book for certain. I would be interested in the type of therapy you had if you don't mind sharing more about it.
<|endoftext|> There are actually a number of videos on Youtube of people practicing telekinesis and showing off various powers.Where?
<|endoftext|>That really is a very good book and does explain these questions very scientifically and rationally. 
<|endoftext|>Yes! You are the winner. Your explanation is not wrapped in superfluous neon plastic with promises of money back guarantees and elevated status in the race to acquire more STUFF...you may not get much attn...I luv ya tho 
<|endoftext|>I favor the perspective that all is truth, I am a pluralist, this stems from the idea that from the individual perspective of every person all that occurs in the mind is truth, all experience is truth. Even when you think you are wrong or something is not true, you must hold that conclusion as truth, so I believe your perspective that there is no truth, as being truthful. Another way to free yourself from mental traps is to accept the paradoxical nature of mentalism and the limits inherent to the constructs of the human mind. The higher dimensions/densities of spiritual nature offer more complete explanations, it just doesn't make any sense from a physical or mental perspective as to why our existence operates the way it does. 
<|endoftext|>Great insight. I for one believe that the universe is large enough and malleable enough to accommodate all of our truths. We are, in a sense, universes onto ourselves, so what really matters is our truth (as long as we don't hurt anyone in the process). 
<|endoftext|> *Karma means something is owed, but owed to whom?*Karma is literally just another name for cause and effect; not some kind of "debt system."
<|endoftext|>It doesn't tho. It shapes perspective which is how we view our reality, not how reality exists, and the only direct causation of perspective effecting reality is quantum perspective matter change.
<|endoftext|>Only through years of meditation can you ever hope to begin to understand. I only know what I know through DMT. 
<|endoftext|>I think that Reddit obfuscates the exact karma value of posts (probably part of why they now only give a single karma value instead of seperate up and down vote totals) If you look at the karma value of just about any post and refresh it a number of times the karma value will keep changing like you said.
<|endoftext|>Nigga I have no idea. While I don't think we are at that point just yet, I think we will be within the next 20 years 
<|endoftext|>I mean so much of what he came out with was gold. He was like the easter bunny of baller metaphysical ideas. Probably my favourite polymath. Wrestled down things like god, infinity and the square root of -1 like a boss.The monadology for sure tops the list. I really dig the whole compossibility idea too.I like this notion there's a constant battle just outside of reality amongst all the things and non-things trying to win existence in this realm. 
<|endoftext|>**The Occult:** Magick - We can't exactly talk about the occult, and subsequently magick, without talking about Aleister Crowley. No matter your opinion on him, he really brought magick somewhat into the mainstream of modern day. Crowley defined Magick as: "The manifestation of ones will into reality", and, "magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will." Crowley also wrote, "it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature." I won't go too much into the obvious implications of magick on a physical level, because I believe /u/bradok did a very good concise breakdown of that in [their post the other day]( with some good links to go along with it. It's broad, and literally comes to classify things like normal gestures of conscious action as magick, but on a deeper level one has to wonder what Crowley knew about the true nature of reality. Yes, it's possible to move an object from A to B through physical means and call it magick, as it was in conformity with will... But what if one were to use conscious techniques that weren't merely applications of complex forms of consciousness (matter), but went directly back to the source? *Psychokinesis:* Theoretically, since one can project their own relative consciousness back up dimensional levels toward the universal source consciousness via techniques like astral projection and transcendental meditation, could one then change physical reality from there? One would suppose so if the will and intention is strong enough. There have been plenty of stories and reports of individuals being able to move things with their minds, and influence reality from afar. A lot tend to come from monks and shamans who claim to have practiced these techniques for years... And that's likely the secret! Of course a regular person like you or I wouldn't be able to use any sort of telekenetic/telepathic powers. We haven't practiced for long enough with the right knowledge of how it works and which techniques to use. Sure, we could take a stab in the dark and maybe get something out of it 1 in a few hundred times, but nothing significant. I'm reminded of that scene in Doctor Strange when Stephen just learns about magic: Dr. Stephen Strange: How do I get from here to there? The Ancient One: How did you get to reattach severed nerves and put a human spine back together bone by bone? Dr. Stephen Strange: Study and practice. Years of it. Crowley was no stranger to secret societies, such as the Order of the Golden Dawn, Ordo Templi Orientis. Secret societies are renowned for practicing and sharing gnostic teachings within their ranks. So besides regular physical manipulation of reality, and source manipulation of reality, what other methods could be possible? *Symbols & Sigils:*Symbols represent fundamental conscious forces, mechanics, and laws of the universe. Spiritual and occult symbology may be the most "pure" or "true to nature" of symbols, but even symbols that are invented by man and then prescribed meanings can hold genuine weight to them so long as the intention that went into their creation and use was strong. Sociology after all is applied psychology, and psychology is applied biology, biology is applied chemistry, chemistry is applied physics, physics is applied mathematics, and all mathematics arises from geometry, which is what this universe is based in. On the most basic level, the very fabric of the universe is simply conscious energy acting through vectors of force. (see /r/Echerdex) If you create a symbol that naturally resonates with the fundamental mechanics of the universe then that symbols will generally interact with the world in the way of the mechanic that it naturally represents (for example: [Flower of life]( = unity of all things. [Yin & yang]( = harmonisation of duality. [Pentagram/Pentacle]( = self-support/strength/protection against evil). These symbols can however be co-opted, subverted, or inverted etc to change or oppose the original meaning (for example: the inverted pentagram, or the swastika). They always have impact - be it either immediately conscious, or subconscious - but generally the significance of its impact is governed by the strength of the intent in the symbols creation and use.Furthermore, if one were to create a symbol for a specific use (let's take the infamous ["boy lover"]( spiraling blue triangle symbol for example) then for it to have an impact the creators and users would have to always apply it and attribute it to that particular use. They'd draw it on the walls when performing the darkest acts of child abuse, and stick it everywhere they go like a graffiti tag, always thinking about and acknowledging the specific meaning every time they see it. And those who had been abused would also think about those same experiences later on when they see the symbol. It may not have an immediate conscious impact on those who don't know the symbols meaning, but it would have an eventual subconscious impact with prolonged exposure. Analysing it, you could attribute certain meanings to the shape and different aspects of it. The spiraling could represent fractality and recursion, like how the abused often become abusers themselves. The triangle can be representative of the all seeing eye. The blue can be representative of boys, as opposed to how pink is to girls. Whether these attributions are intentional, subconscious, or simply synchronistic, one can only speculate.But all-in-all it just goes to show the power these symbols can have. So stay mindful when using and acknowledging symbols, and please manifest reality responsibly. *Rituals:* Similar process, just a further application. It's all about intent, the strength of that intent, attribution of certain symbols together which carry their own meaning and so forth. It's more complex in mechanics, but often simpler in practice. 
<|endoftext|> This sent me down the pantheistic route: the idea that all religions are talking about the same thing - the same universal truth - but that over time it got warped and twisted and metaphor was used to explain abstract concepts, and that over all this time the metaphor got misinterpreted as the answer itself instead of the method to getting there.Precisely. People have been sharing [mystical experiences]( since time immemorial. Rituals formed around the summoning of these experiences, and cultural metaphors were used to describe the ineffable. Each generation would update the dogma based on their own experience with the Other, rather than on an interpretation of a text. 
<|endoftext|>Yeah but my point is that any physicist who is working at the quantum level will hardly ever measure mass in terms of grams, they usually convert it into its equivalent form of energy. If the object is at rest in your reference frame then its just E = mc^2. When measuring the mass of a proton, it is customary to use 938 MeV instead of 1.67*10^-27 kg. This doesnt completely debunk him, but it makes me doubt exactly how much experience he has in theoretical physics. 
<|endoftext|>Rick Strassman talks about machine elves and other ambiguous creatures(including clowns) and reptilian/machine in nature in [The Spirit Molecule.]( Many of the users had similar experiences..and had a hard time even putting them into words. 
<|endoftext|>I can only speak for the God Equation but I'd be interested in reading at least one of the others to see if the writing style is the same, or if it's more than 1 person doing this. It seems a hell of a lot of output for something that (if you ignore the rants) is pretty next level content-wise. There's like what, 8-10 books or something?I found it because I was looking at Eulers Identity anyways. I went from ancient architecture interest in geometry interest in numbers numbers as reality waves / harmony / phi pi holy shit poking at eulers identity. But I was only really messing with that because it had all the things I was looking at in there, I didn't really get what any of it meant (in the metaphysical / big picture sense)And the God Equation filled in a lot of those gaps. Or at least coloured them in in a compelling way. It really doesn't feel like a theory someone's just pulled out their ass. Yet at the same time if it was truly from an illuminated source, would it have the almost constant ranting?Definitely one of the stranger things I've read in a while.
<|endoftext|>well yeah exactly. the universe itself in its entirety is the grand unifying equation made up of the sum of a series of lesser equations that describe it. theres no need to unify it cuz its already all there all around us. we cant possibly write something that complex given our vastly limited knowledge of the universe. from our perspective we can see parts of the universe, string together patterns and add them up but we will never percieve the whole. 
<|endoftext|>No worries, my first as well. I was commuting, and am now at a doctors appointment. Can't speak for everyone else, but I was waiting until I could offer my full attention. 
<|endoftext|>This is always an interesting debate for me (regarding free will etc.), but I would say that once you are on that level, you are in unity with God, not really a puppet of God per se.In the end, beyond the ego, you ARE God, the indivisible, unfathomable infinite potential Source energy that has individuated itself in so many forms.I would always guard myself against the idea that in the end, me and God are somehow separate. Because if you look it at it from that perspective, then yes, you could say as you become enlightened you become a "puppet of God", but this is only true when seen from the false view that you are ultimately the ego, that you are ultimately separate from that which we could call God. So fundamentally I would say this is not the case. You are a puppet now, a puppet of your limitations. As you awaken you free yourself and you regain your true freedom and free will. Free will is not doing what you want from a place of ego, it is doing what you ultimately want as a slice of God, a cell in the infinite organism of life - where you are both the entire organism and a cell simultaneously. So as these beings regain their awareness of their Godlike nature, they regain their awareness of the fundamental unity, which is the natural state. From there they know who they are and what they truly want, as their deepest, truest self. That in my opinion, is then true free will.Simply my perspective of course :)
<|endoftext|>It actually specifically says on my book that there have been plenty of reprints and corrections in later editions of the book, but that the book I'm holding in my hand is a reprint of the original version from Yogananda, back from 1946. So I hope they aren't lying and my book indeed is the original version :)
<|endoftext|>Thanks!  I really wonder why people always connect "shaping reality" with some kind of miracle or mystical happening. There's nothing esoteric about that. We all have the power to shape reality and society. In fact, we do it with every action, whether we want or not, whether we are conscious or not. We often don't realize the opportunities that are there but it has nothing to do with superhuman abilities.
<|endoftext|>I dont make any argument that this is not mostly true also. If you read more of my posts in this thread you will see that the central idea I am expressing is that there is no objective reality; our perceptions of reality are our reality, and our experience of life is eternity without time, for when we cease to perceive reality, there is nothing at either end, that is eternity.Our thoughts are not as original as we think, whether you label it divinity or the collective unconscious, it is tied to something shared and universal. You could call it transcending of time because time is not as absolute as is often granted. Eternity, God, Everything of human experience is both finite and infinite due to the nature of reality being only in the perception of the mind. This is the riddle or paradox of consciousness.
<|endoftext|>DMT? The drug? I'm not interested in any of that. Meditation seems like the key but in today's world it's almost impossible to find the time to maintain something like this without ruining one's day. And there is no comprehensive guide as to any of this that I've seen.
<|endoftext|>Edit: just went to confirm, went to look at my post history (using mobile app fwiw) my two most recent posts were a week or two ago, so I know that no one is looking at them and voting, if I keep refreshing, the one post bounces between 4 and 6, the other between 78 and 82.*actual edit: guess I replied to my comment instead of editing the original :) lol
<|endoftext|>ah he's my favorite polymath too! although i don't know all that many...and damn...did not know he came up with imaginary numbers too O_O, just calculus i thought.yea, the way he deals with god/infinity, zero/souls, etc. like it seems kinda arbitrary at times, but the method he uses is really...seductive? (i'm not a philosopher, so i have no idea what it's called, but it's like a consistent "all-or-nothing" kind of reasoning. like if there can be one, then there can be an infinite, otherwise none. and another similar line of reasoning involving whether something has sufficient reason to exist, or yadda yadda i forget but yea). anyway, he pulls it off in style somehow, so i thought your use of "baller" was amazingly dead-on. totally missed compossibility, will check it out now--thanks! :D
<|endoftext|>**Psychedelics:** Psilocybin, LSD, Ayahuasca, DMT... Isn't it funny how everyone tends to report the same feelings on these? Connecteness... Seeing past the veil at how it all really works... Psilocybin has been [scientifically linked]( with increasing neural pathway interconnectivity, and [increases the number of neural connections]( in your brain when you are on it. It wires together parts of the brain that aren't usually wired together, allowing you to literally experience more of reality than you usually would. LSD has a very similar effect, albeit with it's own quirks and characteristics. *Video interjection!* Here's a 20 minute video with Dead Sea Scroll scholar John Allegro posing the theory that [Jesus Christ was a psychedelic mushroom.]( Very interesting theory! DMT and Ayahuasca though... Now there's something that sends you back to the source. Ayahuasca has been used ceremonially for thousands of years in cultures all over the globe. Eaten, drunk, smoked, absorbed through the skin- whatever method is possible has been done at some point or another. But most of us are more familiar with the Shamans of South America. [They take 2 different plants that are found miles apart from each other, sometimes adding other plants for a varying reasons, and put them together to make one of the most powerful natural psychedelic substances on Earth]( And who told them how to do this? They'll tell you that the trees told them, of course! People often report of a whole process of rebirth on Ayahuasca, along with a total cleansing of body and mind. A lot of people may throw up, shit themselves, cry their eyes out, feel like they die, then become a baby again, then a child, then make their way back to themselves in the end. I could really never do it justice, so here's a great documentary: [DMT: The Spirit Molecule]( And DMT, the pure, refined substance, is most often smoked. DMT users all report a very similar experience. the first toke you star seeing fractals, like LSD visuals, and the connection between things. The second toke and the barrier between you and your environment starts to dissolve. And the third toke... That's when most people report the "breakthrough". Like your own consciousness get shot up a tube across the universe and into another dimension of indescribable emotion and colour. And here's where most people even report talking to other beings. Aliens, reptiles, snakes... Again though, while I've heard and read plenty, I'm not the guy to be telling you about DMT. Let [Terence McKenna give you a lecture on everything you need to know about DMT]( **UFO Tech:** I saw a ufo once. It was 2 years ago, almost to the day. 14th of February 2015. A set of three orange orbs of light forming an equilateral triangle (could have been a triangular craft, could have been three orbs in formation - it was to dark to tell if there was anything solid to it) came slowly over the sky, about ~100-200m high off the ground, toward my house as I was watching from my window. My phone was too far away for me to have gone and get it, got the camera out, and then get a decent video, so instead I kept my eyes locked on to observe as much as I could. It seemed to just be going straight really slowly, until the point when it was almost out of view over my house (I was practically leaning as far out my window at this point as I could) and it took off straight upward as fast as you imagine the Millennium Falcon jumping to light speed. That one event really nailed it in my head that UFOs are not only real, but they utilise a physics that mainstream science says doesn't exist. I've done plenty of research into the physics of UFOs and came across a few videos that I know are great: [Stan Deyo - Lecture on anti-gravity technology]( [Zero Point - Classified Anti-Gravity Craft. Documentary by James Allen]( And also I recommend the documentary ["Unacknowledged"]( which is available on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Also, you ever heard of how Hollywood drip-feeds information? I can't remember where exactly i heard of it, but I had heard a theory a while ago about how some aliens pilot their craft through meditation and visualising where they wish to go. Well I saw Marvel's "Black Panther" the other day, and in one part the Wakandans are piloting their advanced craft exactly like that. I saw it and thought, "well... that's drip feeding if anything!" but I just can't remember where I originally saw it. Oh well. Thought I might as well share that anyway, since it's relevant. Anyway, alongside these I want to include a series of videos from an alien abductee who tells not only of alien bases on earth, but the UFO tech, and pre-birth memories of conscious existence before incarnation. He was able to remember these suppressed memories with thanks to hypnosis regression sessions with Budd Hopkins. Video 1: [50 minute talk of his experiences]( Video 2: [20 minute Q&A session]( Video 3: [20 minute talk about hypnosis sessions]( ~~ Geez. That took a while to write... Sorry if it got a little lazy there at the end with my depth, but I started writing this about 7 hours ago and time just flew by. Thank you if you actually read all this, and I hope you save some of the link for later watching/reading!
<|endoftext|>Ooh thanks for that study link! I haven't seen it before, but I just read the abstract and it sounds proper interesting! I've saved it now for later reading. 
<|endoftext|>Thanks a fair point. If you read some of the papers he's published, he converts the units in accordance with the respective equations. I believe it's mostly presentation at the end, as having everything in the same units makes it easy for someone unfamiliar with quantum physics to understand. 
<|endoftext|>yea, totally agree. the god equation is when it all started coming together. funny how different our paths were though. i somehow ended up on this website: of crazy shit on there. it actually starts off with flat earth o_O but i dunno if it's supposed to be a metaphor or what. from there, it's pretty much a conspiracy buffet, and also a extremely intriguing (and jarring) introduction to conspiracies in general--yeup, that was me. it's almost a little creepy, because there's a very strong feeling of nonchalant conviction in his/their tone, like they have no doubt of the ability to and certainty of completing their objective. there were still some questions or issues that i thought were left unaddressed though, which i thought was a little suspicious. their idea of a true meritocracy sounds really good at first...but also sounds like another gateway to some totalitarian dystopia, except on the opposite end of the spectrum from communism. like, the 100% inheritance tax is good in theory if you want extreme equality of opportunity. but i feel like that's another idealistic proposal with huge potential for abuse, e.g. not worth it in practical terms. plus, it might result in removing a major natural drive for success--to gather wealth to ensure the future of your offspring. i dunno, just didn't get the best vibes from some of that stuff.anyway, going through the metaphysical concepts was a trip. i also pursued the ontological mathematics idea for a while too...i definitely remember my mind being blown repeatedly. dude...hold on lemme pull something i did that was inspired by this whole line of thinking. actually, i'll leave it at the bottomand yea, i also get the feeling that this is NOT the product of a single mind, and a most likely a longtime in the making. if i had to guess, i'd say it was a single voice that was responsible for the narration, but the content was probably discussed/selected by a group including hockney. ok, so i didn't discover any of these--i just pulled the numbers and actually did the calculations, because i had to see for myself. i'll start with the pyramids...**base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet****original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet****base perimeter of great pyramid  original height of great pyramid** = 3,023.16 feet  481.3949 feet = 6.2800000586.280000058  2 = **3.140000029** that's prettty close to pi, close enough that i'd say it's probably not a coincidence. but so what right? well, mainstream consensus is that Ancient Egyptians thought pi was about 3.16, and that it wasn't until Archimedes that pi was recognized to be around 3.14. so...questionable.ok, it gets weirder. i'm gonna assume you're familiar with the significance of the number 432 yea? so it turns out, the major, externally-visible dimensions of the pyramid, correlate to the dimensions of the earth at a scale of **432,000:1**. crazy, considering that they had no idea of or way to confirm the dimensions of the planet (so we're taught). **original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet****481.3949 feet x 432,000** = 207,962,596.8 feet = **3,938.685 miles****3,938.685 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 11 miles, or an error of about 0.2%)****base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet****3,023.16 feet x 432,000 = 1,306,005,120 feet = 24,734.94 miles****24,734.94 miles = equatorial circumference of earth ( minus about 70 miles, or an error of about 0.6%)**(note: the accurate calculation of the dimensions of the earth are typically credited to Eratosthenes around 300-200 B.C.; go figure...) but ok, so school and mainstream history are shit. i can accept that. this was my WTF moment.but some setup first...it's a very strange coincidence--one of many that include the moon--that the sun is 400x larger than the moon, and ALSO happens to be 400x further away from earth than the moon is, which is why we have total solar eclipses and total lunar eclipses. meh. here's another fun fact:**approximate speed of light = 186,000 miles per second****432 x 432 = 186,624 (an error of about 0.3%)**cool, but maybe just coincidence still right?## approximate diameter of the sun = 864,000 miles## 432 x 2 = 864## approximate diameter of moon = 2,160 miles## 432  2 = 216when i saw that, i think i literally shivered and had thoughts of being in the matrix flashing through my head. i dunno, that freaked the shit out of me personally, for at least 5 minutes. i dunno...for the original, i had gone through a ton of other information all highlighting the cosmic holiness of the number 432, so maybe it got in my head by the time i made that last calculation XP anyway, there's actually a ton of stuff like this. i think this is the closest i'll get to experiencing some manifestation of ontological mathematics. which is totally fine with me, because i was imagining like 6 foot tall, solid-colored, single-digit integers with eyes, arms and legs, and they weren't nice.
<|endoftext|>I've always felt like we're just taking things we can see and translating those things into numbers and equations, and that the numbers and equation don't really have any meaning beyond a system we created that allows us to predict the action/reaction of other things in our universe.  The equations are just representation of actions we observe, they don't *explain* anything. It's like reverse engineering a video game, but not understanding anything about the system it runs on and how the system came to be (or who built the system).It's not like "oh the earth spins around the sun because of this underlying equation here"....no, it spins around the sun because it spins around the sun, you just translated that into a system of numbers to describe the same thing. I feel like it gives us a superficial feeling of "understanding" the universe when really we dont know anything about what all of this is and why it's here. It barely addresses the "how" beyond translating into numbers. Knowing the universe is a state of mind or being. Science is drawing us farther and farther away from that via an inflated sense of understanding.  Knowing is a spiritual state. 
<|endoftext|>Wow you're good! Another intriguing idea is that exploiting the creative powers of everyday thought, starting in individuals, and subsequently ramping way up to populations is such a dastardly mastermind grand scheme...
<|endoftext|>ruin ones day? I get what you mean... we spend our days chasing our tails around as per their design so we don't have time for spiritual development. 
<|endoftext|>I don't think he came up with imaginary numbers. I think most of the work there was Euler, a contemporary (and then later Gauss).He took them seriously tho, wrestled with them philosophically and tried to integrate them properly in his conceptual model (whereas they were mostly lol'd at and shunned by others - imaginary as a label was meant to be derogatory.) On that infinite / complex front, I think you'll get a kick out of this... the math puts you off, skip down to "the inverse function". That made a whole lot of shit slot together for me in terms of infinity...
<|endoftext|>If this was condensed into a news article and ran in the New York Times the world would be a better place.
<|endoftext|>Ill check him out more, I guess Im kinda unqualified to make this statement since Ive never read his work. But there are a lot of junk physics theories that work on bad math out there that you have to watch out for. And sadly it is virtually impossible for someone not versed in the math to be able to discern between what is legit and what isnt. Edit: not sure what your math skills are, just talking in general
<|endoftext|>you should definitely read the mathematical universe by max tegmark. heres an interesting, also relevent talk from the same author. most interesting to note, he postulates these equations are concious.
<|endoftext|>Haha, You're awesome dude. I love this shit and you're always welcome to hit me up about it directly. I went to see Chichen Itza which kinda blew me away. The acoustic properties are ridiculous. That made me start taking a really close look at that sorta ancient architecture.Here's a mixed bag of shit I've come across in the last coupla years which I know you'll really vibe. - a grand musical theory of everything. which is to say waves rule errything around me. guy goes into a lot of interesting stuff to do with harmony, number, music, waves, history, everything. He spends a bunch of time analysing Rosslyn Chapel which is very very revealing from a practical and a historical perspective. When I came across that I'd already been following this guy for a while... on measurements he took from a ~3000BCish site in Scotland, he deduced a new value for Pi in terms of the square root of two which he called 'Qute'. It's spitting distance from the supposed rational pi of Giza (22/7) and really hammered home that ratio is how a lot of this shit works and the square root of two is mad important. After spending a crapload of time looking at this, I can confirm it's legit and indeed some of the lessons to be found in Giza are to do with this. Makes Giza look like a legit place of learning to have all this shit encoded so obviously in it. And it is pretty obvious when you start using it and whole numbers start popping out everywhere. Khafre the middle pyramid has a side-length of half the square root of 2 (707) which is a big clue. If you recall from the God Equation / Unit Circle that's also the point where the complex + real domains balance out....The layout of the whole site jives around sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), so whatever lesson is there is mathematical first and foremost. People are like, yeah but it's in feet.. but fail to realise that feet (and also the meter) were key'd to dimensions of the earth. How they got to that point, who knows, but it's pretty undisputable.(Arguably the foot spoken of is Gods foot.)On that front, for a really solid treatment on ancient metrology check out Taking Measure by Scott Onstott. You'll also really like his series on youtube 'secrets in plain sight' and his lil coffee table book Quantification which talks a lot about the numbers you mention (sometimes known as precession numbers but i think they are all 3-smooth numbers personally - also known as the harmonic numbers) Actually I'd probably start with those last two and work back from there. He looks pretty hard at the sort of mind-blowing "coincidences" you mention. 
<|endoftext|>Ugh, I hate these type of things. Take some values do some arbitrary arithmetic to it, get pi or phi or whatever, therefore consciousness, energy, we are all connected man. It makes no sense.All these things are most probably cooked up by some crank to peddle their book or course or cult, and are repeated ad nauseam by people on the internet. 
<|endoftext|>thats what im sayin dood loledit: i didnt incorporate the spiritual part so in fact i mispoke. we can know the whole but youre right thats a spiritual state.
<|endoftext|>Ok. I dont want to jus argue with you to win on this point, so please dont take this response that way. I dont know how much you are into philosophy, but the ancient Greeks long ago proved that objective reality is a *faith* not a fact. I certainly *may* exist but you or I are utterly incapable of proving it.I dont bring this up to tell you that you are wrong or to convince you to believe me, rather because it is a worthwhile thought to contemplate. *How can you tell that there is an external reality?*This is the philosophical thought exercise question that all the related brain in a vat theories stem from, here people usually express it as living in a simulation. Can you actually prove to yourself that the world is real and you are not the only person here and that everyone else is not just an npc (think like The Matrix style brain jack except you are the only one that is not an AI). Or the more simplistic version that most kids contemplate as their first native philosophical thought about reality (which I think having *this* or a similar thought is the sign that a child has fully become conscious): How do I know that what I see as red doesnt look yellow to someone else? The only way we learn colors is by pointing to one and saying its name. Curious as to your thoughts.
<|endoftext|>Books on Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism. The basic notion of karma is that if you do a bad action that you must atone for that action at some point in time. You build up and pay off karma. It's even referred to in those texts as 'karmic debt'. 
<|endoftext|>Exactly what I'm trying to say. Unless we forfeit certain things in our daily lives, maintaining spiritual activities is pretty hard to do. That's the design.
<|endoftext|>sweet, i can tell this is going to be fun a article! totally dig his psycho-mathematical hypothesis--personally resonates with me very strongly. also makes me wonder if we ended up with a system of math that describes imaginary numbers in this way because of some limitation in our thinking/perception, or if we developed a representation of mathematics that was flawed and its limitations manifest as weirdness like imaginary numbers which most people don't naturally/easily understand (me included). but yea, i'm gonna try to struggle through the whole thing--only about 1/10 in so far XP
<|endoftext|>That would be beautiful to see. If only it were so easy to condense, but if anyone can do that then I'd emplore them to do so! It's still missing some links into alternative history, astrology, psychology, and aliens that I'd have liked to put in there, and I'd have liked to have gone into more detail with pretty much all the topics as well (but mostly the ufos part), but that was the first time I'd ever gone and put so much of it all out in one post, and since I did it in one sitting it's no surprise I missed out plenty. It's effectively a theory of everything. But hey, since it's now there at least I have somewhere to start! I plan to one day put all this in a book so getting something solid actually written down is gonna help.
<|endoftext|>All of these comments are amazing, they line up so closely with my own path and understandings. I think these would make a great holofractal superthread, even. 
<|endoftext|>Yeah that's a totally relevant point. In this field there's a lot of people who make all sorts of claims but can't back it up with anything solid. It's why I suggest reading the papers that explain the theory with the maths to go along with it. And even for those who aren't great at maths, the text explains what the maths is showing. I was lucky that in the last few years of my schooling we covered quantum mechanics and particle physics pretty thoroughly, and it ended up being one of my favorite subjects so I continued studying it in my spare time since I left school. So I've got a pretty decent grasp on it. I'm definitely no expert, but I'm relatively confident of my understating, especially when the working is presented well. 
<|endoftext|>Oh and I guy I started following recently has been chasing down that thread pretty hard too. Check out Danny Wilten on youtube. He does the Giza thing a ridiculous amount of justice. You'll be hearing a lot more of that name I reckon. He's what you'd get if Graham Hancock had a baby with a CIA analyst. 
<|endoftext|>eh...the calculations with the pyramid aren't all that arbitrary. they use the two major visible dimensions of the pyramid with a single arithmetic operation. it's not complicated...and you can call it a coincidence. but i don't think most people would think that calculations that result in under 1% error can be automatically dismissed, especially in the context of the monumental efforts involved in building the great pyramid. i mean seriously, try making ANYTHING that can correlate that closely to...pretty much anything else?? and we only have 4 simple operations for basic mathematics, assuming they wanted to build a structure that would retain its form for a long time, i really don't see many other ways they could have done it better. also, pi and phi are pretty fucking important and connected to **literally almost everything in the universe**. i mean, if you don't care about or appreciate math or science at all, then sure, it's probably all just gibberish to you. you might want to consider actually reading the descriptions of how the calculations are derived before judging them. i didn't mindlessly copy/paste this information (well i did for reddit, but it was from my own article), i actually looked up the measurements and did the calculations to make sure it made sense--that was the whole point!
<|endoftext|>Can I also make a hand-wave to his Theodicy. It's where he gathers his ideas that confront and engage Christian theology straight on. It's also his work that explains his answer to the Problem of Evil: where the phrase "best of all possible worlds" comes from. Quite different from Augustine, and much more Matrix-like.As I understand it (anyone more knowledgeable jump in), he assumes the *potential* of infinite, different overlapping, even incompatible universes "created" or "thought" by an all-powerful God. This concept seems a lot like modern multiverse, but he held there was still only one "real" universe (possibly to stay out of trouble?).So with all those infinity of universes, he decides that IF God is Good, THEN we would inhabit the best possible version of all the possible universes - as shabby as it often appears to us. God only knows...edit
<|endoftext|>I agree, I think the key is relating all these topics to how it affects the average individual on a regular daily basis. Thats all the modern consumer cares about sadly and a book is a good way into doing exactly that so I wish you well!
<|endoftext|>wow, never heard of him, but i really like graham hancock (dunno if he's still around). and i gotta look into this qute thing. sqrt(2)'s always seem mathematically prominent to me. sqrt(3) not so much...so that should be interesting. o, and i've definitely seen secrets in plain sight, such a fun series. by "his", are you referring to the narrator? i always assumed it was just a random noname dude lol. ahh just looked up precession number--didn't know that's what it was called. thought you meant pi, e and phi...which are each an entire rabbithole. i still need to go back to the god equation to remember how e fits into it all.wow you've gone through a LOT of this material O__O didn't know anyone else was into this. but yea, i gotta get into at least some of this stuff right now, or you'll never get a reply XP
<|endoftext|>They are arbitrary. In your first example, why take the perimeter? Why not base? Why divide by 2? It is completely arbitrary.Second one: Alright 432 is special but 432000 is not 432, scaling to it makes no sense. The rest of the calculation is just a restatement of point 1. Third one is even more egregious. The errors in the previous cases can be attributed to the fact that they involve human constructions but in this case the parameters that you take are natural. Are you saying whatever caused this correlation reached at 98% and said "eh close enough".432*432 only becomes close to the speed of light if we use FPS system, so it is a coincidence.In taking the diameter of the sun you round *down* to the nearest thousand, but in taking the diameter of the moon you round *up* to the nearest ten. See, arbitrary.I do have an appreciation for Math and Science, which is why I can call bullshit on stuff like this. 
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the link, I have not read his work before and will look at it. I still hope you take into account my reply to your other comment, your dismissal of ideas due to race is troubling. And I dont know where your statement: There are others out there and I ask you find them. Philosophy is not just a white man's topic. Everyone from all walks of life can think and paint in abstract. Even children as young as 5 provide eye-opening insights. Seems to be assuming things that I never implied. Maybe it is a misunderstanding of my reference. I specifically used Ancient Greeks as an example because they are the oldest philosophers that I know for a fact produced arguments that reality is impossible to prove. My intent was to show that it is an *old* idea, not to confer superiority to one culture over others.  I hope that clarifies things and that you find a way to let go of whatever anger is troubling you.
<|endoftext|>I dont really know how you think their race or sex or even perceptions of other societies figures into the validity of their theories which stand up to logical analysis. Do those pointless trivia affect the validity of the Pythagorean theorem!? These things can be evaluated mathematically.My belief isnt given by other people, I read their ideas and choose whether I agree with them or even simply entertain their conclusions. That is critical thinking. My own beliefs are built upon learning from others. There are also other cultures which have produced profound thought, even thoughts which I appreciate the value of if I dont believe or agree with it. Never has the race or sex or culture of the people been a factor of determining the value of it, though knowing this can help one understand the basis of their thought.It is honestly disturbing that you bring this up when it has no precedent in the discussion. Even more disturbing that you are comfortable calling a culture lesser. It sounds like you are *extremely* hung up on preconceived notions from your response. Accepting that reality is subject to perception is actually a step towards balance and a rather important notion of one wishes to find value from thought across many cultures. To claim that there is an objective reality is the basis for claiming there is a right and wrong way to think, and it is that very notion upon which prejudices are built. That you arbitrarily label one group or another lesser is evidence of prejudice. I hope you can release that and wish you good luck.
<|endoftext|>yea, i remember that one for sure. i remember the math-y version a little better i think (err...i *think* this is from leibniz and not mike hockney, but i could be mixing them together...) it was something along the lines of there being one mathematical system that's perfect, which is the one that comprises our universe. any other (imperfect) system would eventually destroy itself due to inconsistencies or other self-contradictory errors. so i'm not sure that it completely precludes other universes existing simultaneously. but then i don't know enough about his conception of time either, so that's not a surprise. i'm listening to mike hockney's stuff again, which is heavily influenced (that's an understatement, leibniz is basically german jesus to him) by leibniz, so actually, there's a good chance the math version isn't from liebniz?but yea, listening to some of the concepts again, reminds me of how freakishly modern a lot of liebniz's ideas are. i almost feel like he was able to achieve this through raw intellect, like brute forcing logic, savant-style. it's like he was able to see past the patterns/dynamics between scientific development and philosophy, which allowed him to leap over centuries intellectually, and actually get to the core philosophical issues that modern sciences is still dancing around. i still think his monadology stuff is one of the most ambitious attempts at a TOE. i still think there's space for simulation theory within his ideas, but maybe less developed in his time? i mean it just wans't as in-your-face obviosu without computers and VR. intuitively, i feel like these three concepts complement each other in describing the universe--holographic principles, fractals, simulations. and i'm *almost positive* that these concepts are somehow subtly/not-so-subtly being pushed on us, because i've seen people randomly mentioning the same intuition online. totally can't see why though...o_O'this stuff makes me feel so nostalgic. this is where my whole "wtf is the illuminati" question started, and when i actually started considering the possibility that automatically dismissing conspiracies could be really really stupidi. it's so crazy how a single thread of thought from a random session of browsing can lead to an absolutely exhaustive overhaul of your worldview.
<|endoftext|>Hancock's still around but I think he got sidetracked from his real research by his brand. The importance of the qute is pretty next level. There's a lotta dudes like that guy who've quietly torn things apart and are just waiting for the rest of the world to catch up.I think the true value of pi is one of the keys that allows you to unlock a lot of the ontological stuff in real terms. 'His' == narrator == Scott Onstott, yeah. should help you slot e into the picture. Read interference theory for a solid treatment of phi. If you're a spreadsheet or a python sort of guy, I can probably throw some interesting snippets your way. 
<|endoftext|>1) again, there are only so many measurements visible from the exterior. perimeter, height, diagonal, slant height and....? ok...you can see there's not much else to work with. and fine, like i said, maybe that's a coincidence, though given the abundance of other coded numbers found in the great pyramid, i really doubt it. what i presented are just some that i was personally interested in. 2) are you serious??? if you wanted to use 432 in some way, that's the simplest way. unless you would want to make a pyramid that's 1000 times bigger! just wow...3 [this is actually still the same example...]) dude what are you even saying--do you even know? this one is by far the most obvious, which is why you just start spouting some laughable word salad in your attempt to debunk it. first of all, what does it matter if the parameters are natural?? it's the fucking radius and circumference of the planet LOL. and both of those are proportional to the perimeter and height of the pyramid AT THE SAME RATIO. and the error is under 1%, *as i clearly stated*. of course you can claim it's still a coincidence, just nobody would agree with you.4) i'd agree with that, except that feet were used in all my previous examples as well. and only? you realize we didn't even get close to an accurate estimate of the speed of light until thousands of years later right? and even more importantly, **the speed of light is actually coded into the pyramid in other ways, including one that matches it in the metric system, down to several decimal places**. so...probably not a coincidence.5) hmm...yea, see, because like i said, the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon 0__0 just the fact that one number can relate in this way so closely to the two largest objects in the sky, using only 2 numbers, 2 operations, and scaling by 10s is amazing. plus the example regarding the sizes is also incredibly stunning. **the fact that you make no mention of this makes it pretty obvious that you don't give a shit**, you're just trying to cover up the fact that you made a stupid judgement--and you're failing pretty hard.i think it's at least clear you don't really have an appreciation for math (or when scaling is necessary, or how simple it is to add zeros while still retaining much of the same content, or the visible dimensions of a pyramid, etc.), though i suspect science as well. or maybe you just don't have an appreciation for the english language, and don't understand what "arbitrary" means. it's also likely that you just dismissed my reply (which wasn't even addressed to you) without really reading it the first time. then when i called you out on it, you tried to pull some shit out your ass, but it turned out weak and forced, so now you look ridiculous, especially with your reasoning in #2,3,5. sure, you can call bullshit on anything you want, but it doesn't mean much, especially in this case.
<|endoftext|>The problem with simulation is this: if its true then there's absolutely nothing that would, could, or really needs to change.That is, in straight simulation, where we are someone's game pieces, very possibly as virtual as a million charge particles in tiny energy apartment blocks, there still is only one way to "break through" or "get free" or "realize who we are" that *are not the already existing ways to do those things*!
<|endoftext|>Oh and I can recommend taking a look at vedic mathematics.What is now mostly remembered as a system of mental shortcuts are actually the faint echos of a very complete understanding of that most special of number bases (modulo 9 / base 10). Using that you can perform operations on stupidly large numbers as strings of individual digits / characters. Think about that...(I'd recommend the physics side of the vedic stuff too. both Tesla and Einstein credited the Vedic Sutras as a source of great inspiraton. They also have one of the most chill 'creation' stories I've read. It's like a cosmic wink and a shrug ) 
<|endoftext|>1) You did not rebut my point at all. Like you said there are multiple measurements visible from the exterior. perimeter, height, base width and slant height. My point is that there are so many combinations measurements available so why this particular combination is selected? The division by two after taking their ratio is also completely arbitrary and is just there to force pi.2) The ratio between radius of earth and height of great pyramid is much closer to 434000 than 432000, circumference of earth and base perimeter of great pyramid is around 435000 not 432000.3,023.16 feet x 432,000 = 1,306,005,120 feet = 24,734.94 milesAlso Your math is off by a whole order of magnitude, so you clearly have not checked it. 3) Let me explain. Let, height of great pyramid be (h) , base perimeter of great pyramid be p, radius of earth be r, circumference of earth be c.From your first statement p/h  2*pi, by definition the ratio between the circumference of any circle and its radius 2*pi. So we can take any circular spherical or cylindrical object and we can say that the ratio of its circumference is the same as p/h. We can do this with any object, all we have to do is pick a magic number as a scaling factor and look for any object which has a similar size as the scaled down or up dimension. For example a my dick is approximately cylindrical and has a radius of 1.3 inches the circumference of its cross section is  8.168 inches.We all know 432 is special so 4320 is also special.**Height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet****481.3949 feet  4320 = 0.111434005 ft = 1.33720806 inches.****1.33720806 inches = Radius of my dick (with an error of 2%)****Base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet****3,023.16 feet  4320 = 0.699805556 ft = 8.397666672 inches.****8.397666672 inches = the circumference of my dick (with an error of 2%)**SpooooookyEither ancient Egyptians scaled the pyramids with respect to my dick (in a ratio of 1:4320) or this type of argument is bullshit. You pick.4) Where is it stated in the pyramid that the speed of light is 432 squared in miles per second? Miles and seconds were units invented 1000s years after the Ancient Egyptians. you realize we didn't even get close to an accurate estimate of the speed of light until thousands of years later right?If it is not explicitly written down or used in some sort of measurement that the speed of light is so and so then we cannot assume that they knew it.All this arithmetic voodoo is just working backwards from what we already know. the speed of light is actually coded into the pyramid in other ways, including one that matches it in the metric system, down to several decimal placesAgain metric system is 1000s of years younger than the pyramids. So you are saying that not only did the Egyptians know the speed of light but they also knew what units we would use in the future.Which is more plausible Ancient Egyptians had advanced scientific knowledge and ability to *predict the future* or all these "codes" that you seem to find in the pyramids are a product of your own confirmation bias?? 5) The fact that the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon and is 400 times as far is amazing but it is still a coincidence. two largest objects in the sky, using only 2 numbers, 2 operations, and scaling by 10s is amazingBut it is not just two operations, you arbitrarily round up the moon's size and round down the sun's size. Anything can seem related if you apply arbitrary set of rules.Personal attacks are unnecessary and exposes your own childishness.Edit: Formatting
<|endoftext|>Wow. You are so far into your belief that you will attempt to fit any information into it. I was never angry or offended, simply surprised at your heavy prejudice. Goodbye.
<|endoftext|>hmm i guess i don't mean it exactly in that way--i still believe there is free will. i'm just not sure about everything else. it could be a bias though. not sure why i expect "natural" things to be analog in nature rather than digital. 
<|endoftext|>1) like i said, maybe that's a coincidence, though given the abundance of other coded numbers found in the great pyramid, i really doubt it. what i presented are just some that i was personally interested in.2) off by a digit. but yes, "a whole order of magnitude" sounds much fancier. -__- anyway, like i said before, and which you apparently still don't understand, you can still convey useful content while staying mathematically consistent by using zeros, especially since they can represent a placeholder, as it does in our number system. here's another example: 00you're00a00fucking00retard00. but i'm sure you'll just chalk that up to coincidence.3) mm yea...difference is, no one cares about your dick (which you've described as comically large, most likely overcompensating for its equally comical tininess in actuality), and you arbitrarily picked those numbers. also, your % errors are more than "an order of magnitude" greater than between the earth and pyramid. finally **the earth is not a perfect sphere**. it's especially funny how stupid you are when trying to seem intelligent XD4) ok, so you're criticizing me for arbitrarily making things fit, yet **you're completely ignoring well-known facts to fit your arguments**. the "invention" of seconds by the ancient babylonians preceded the egyptians. and the metric system is based off the measurements of the earth. so maybe check your own confirmation bias. 5) uhh what were you trying to do here? the first sentence is quoted but you don't say anything about it (probably because there's not much to say). anyway, if you want to "arbitrarily" ignore the last part of the sentence, that's on you. i'm okay with personal attacks when dealing with a biased and retarded neckbeard who's more concerned with being right (yet still failing) than acknowledging reality (especially when wrong, instead of doubling down on idiocy). if that makes me child, then just know you're [much] dumber than a child ;D
<|endoftext|>Because logic. It's man-made. Nature is analog, I can assure you to the limits you want to study it.
<|endoftext|>1) like i said, maybe that's a coincidence, though given the abundance of other coded numbers found in the great pyramid, i really doubt it. what i presented are just some that i was personally interested in.My point is that all these "coded" messages you speak of are not actually put in by the Egyptians but "discovered" after the fact by cranks with books to sell. Given a set of numbers it is extremely easy to connect them with pi or phi or any so called cosmic numbers with simple arithmetic operations.2) Yeah, off by a digit. What it shows is that you don't know what you are talking about, and just copy pasted this whole wall of text from some crank website without verifying it yourself. Zero is not just a placeholder. Are you telling me that 10 and 100 are the same? Maybe I should tell this to my Machine Design professor, material selection just got a whole lot easier.3) Thank you again for completely missing the point. What I was trying to demonstrate is that you can use your line of reasoning to connect anything to anything. You can connect pyramids to coke cans, oil drums, soccer balls etc just the way I connected pyramids to my dick. The errors that I get are the same as that stated in your example, around 2 %.4) ok, so you're criticizing me for arbitrarily making things fit, yet you're completely ignoring well-known facts to fit your argumentsSo, you admit you make things fit arbitrarily. Also, What facts have I ignored? I pretty much rebutted everything in your comment point by point.The rest of your comment needs a big [Citation needed]. It wasn't untill the 16th century that clocks that can reliably keep track of seconds were developed. 5) You are the one that is ignoring evidence. You still haven't responded to why you round the moon's size up and the sun's size down.I have wasted enough time on you. It is clear that you wont back up any of your claims against criticism with actual arguments and instead resort to personal attacks. I have nothing more to say to you. 
<|endoftext|>If anything, it is frustration that you refuse to *listen* to what I am stating clearly and continue to argue points that are not related at all to anything I wrote; you are arguing with yourself.I never placed any special consideration on the reference to Greek philosophers or the validity of their claims. I only said that they were old, and had made the point I was making a long time ago. *All that is meant to prove is that people have been thinking this for millennia, and that the idea was not my own.*. Whether they were the first to think of any particular idea or not isnt relevant, just that I know for a fact that they did indeed propose that idea, but I do not know for certain if another culture did before them, most likely many others did before them, but that constitutes a *guess* on my part.I get that apparently you are into the writings of other cultures and want to share them, that is awesome! However, doing so confrontationally by insulting certain ones and implying racial bias towards people for mentioning the most widely known ancient philosophers is not a productive way to do so. Look at this discussion! You have continuously accused me of some phantom bias and we ended up in *this* pointless discussion when you could have used all those words to share some of the more interesting parts of the philosophers you want to share. Instead you continuously tried to assign your own perception of the world to what I have said (ironically proving my original point of how much our perception of reality influences what we take to be *real*). I can clearly see and understand that you are frustrated by the primacy Greek philosophy holds in western education. But you should understand that this isnt universal, a cultures education gives primacy to the specific cultures upon which it is built. In Asia, I imagine that Asian philosophy holds primacy in the general education, and in the Muslim world the focus is on Muslim philosophers and so on and so forth. Obviously, a well-rounded education should include as many different views as possible, but I dont know how you believe I am gatekeeping simply by referencing one that suits the purpose of my argument both by directly addressing my point, and by being very familiar to most of my audience. It would do no good to reference a scholar that almost no one is familiar with in the context of my statement.
<|endoftext|>wait, are you talking in the context of simulation theory? e.g. the nature outside this simulation? or that this isn't a simulation and reality here IS analog? because a lot of our newer science seems to hint at a digital nature, like the planck length being the minimum distance or quantum entanglement allow instantaneous transmission of information. there could be other explanations for sure, and maybe we're just not there yet.
<|endoftext|>right - not arguing with the surprising digital aspects we do find like the planck number, but consider the 99% of territory we can investigate and find systems that turn out non-binary, and apparently continuous, often fractal or otherwise infinitely dense. This is the fundamental problem with a Wolframesque Universe - made of bits all the way down. We made up bits, as far as I can tell. Nature has waves or something.
<|endoftext|>Are you aware that formal logic works on the principles of mathematics?A proof of the Pythagorean theorem operates the same way as a logical proof of a philosophical argument using Boolean statements.If you want to invalidate the premise that objective reality can not be proven, you will really need to know this.To my knowledge the ancient Greeks were the first to put that premise into rigorous formal logic and keep a written record of it. As I said, this could be a lack of my familiarity with other groups *or* merely historic coincidence that their written record happened to survive whilst others were lost to time.At this point you arent really arguing with me, but with the historical record which I am merely citing.I am tired of arguing over arguments. If you want to respond, why dont you contribute some ideas from the people you hold in high esteem so that we can discuss them. I am sure that would make a more productive discussion, their words are likely more interesting than mine.
<|endoftext|>i see. so maybe it's our perceptual limitations that cause us to interpret stuff in this way. weird though, what's that say about us?? lol
<|endoftext|>So Wolfram (author of the mathematica franchise and the book "A New Kind of Science") suggests that because computing using binary Turing machines is so incredibly powerful, the universe itself must be a Turing Machine. Therefore he really pushes back against things like Godel's Uncertainty Principle, and Turing's Halting Problem.I actually like Wolfram's ideas, but not that one. I cannot believe the universe can be computed by what we have now. It has to be something more like the holofractal ideas. Or the fuzzy logic which is now being instrumentalized with quantum and DNA computing, where the answers come back shades of grey instead of black and white. But the problem is logic - it's famously binary due to the Excluded Middle. There's nothing in between true and false. (Which is why "truthy" and "falsy" are so funny to us - those make perfect sense to me - but I've drank the koolaid on this one.)
<|endoftext|>Kurt Gdel would like a word with you. Absolute statements in mathematics are only absolute within their own paradigm. IE they have to be absolute, in order for the system thereof derived to be functional. Also, there is no logical proof that objective reality does not exist, because there can be no logical proof that anything does not exist. Russel's teapot.Do you not think that, if there was no objective reality, it could not appear as if it was? That is, the existence of apparent absolutes is not inherently a proof of an objective reality, since if this is a subjective reality, it may appear as objective. How can you tell?Of course, this is based on the works of a bunch of old white men, so feel free to disregard it if it's too much.

<|endoftext|>Hope I'm not too late to the party! So a fascinating fact I learned the other day is that Charles Manson was actually sent to Boys Town as a youth. His stay there was short, but he was nonetheless sent there. My source for this is the recent Time Magazine publication on killer cults. Another interesting thing about him was all the celebrities he bumped shoulders with, including those in the occult. While on the subject of the occult, there is a film director from the same time period named Kenneth Anger who made a lot of occult videos and short movies, and who also participated in various occult groups throughout the years. He even had Jim Morrison and Anton Levay in his movies (as well as other famous hollywood stars of the time). He was also reported to have done graphic movies, as well as possible snuff films. The only reason I discovered him and his videos is because of a music video on YouTube called "Duality" , by Captain Murphy. It is a compilation of cult footage, as well as occult footage, all blended together for 35 minutes. I suggest watching it, as I would like to hear someone else's opinion on it considering it is a modern-day occult video. The occult is alive and well, and people are being a lot more blatantly open about it these days.
<|endoftext|>FBI Director for 20+ years Ted Gunderson speaking about the Franklin Coverup. Gunderson joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1951 under J. Edgar Hoover. He served in the Mobile, Knoxville, New York City, and Albuquerque offices. He held posts as an Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge in New Haven and Philadelphia. In 1973 he became the head of the Memphis FBI office and then the head of the Dallas FBI office in 1975. Ted Gunderson was appointed the head of the Los Angeles FBI in 1977.He became a private investigator and was the start of the Franklin Coverup. He gave his life to fight what he thought was high level satanic occultism that had permeated society on a grand scale.

<|endoftext|>ALEISTER CROWLEY: PDF Source Information(Warning: some of this material could be disinformation as well. Please research.):  COVER-UP: 
<|endoftext|>I discovered something very relevant to this the other day. Crowley was a Freemason, active in a great number of lodges. I don't know much about the Masons but I found this surprising. I found this lengthy, thorough, and well-sourced write-up of the connections on an official Freemason site. Worth a read.[
<|endoftext|>In Alan Moore's *V for Vendetta*, the character V proclaims that *'Do as thou wilt'* will be the law.Alan Moore is supposedly a practitioner of magick himself.Given that a lot of people in this sub identify with or are supportive of the ideas behind 'Anonymous' I will be interested to see if any address this.
<|endoftext|>I personally don't like the Idolizing of Aleister Crowley.Fact: He died penniless and alone. "Although the actual dates of Crowleys death are heavily disputed (either Dec 1st or Dec 5th) it is true that he died a heroin addict in 1947 in a boarding house in Hastings, South East England."

<|endoftext|>I really hope this isn't meant to equate Crowley with the Franklin cover-up.. Occultism does not automatically mean ritualistic murder and rape of children.
<|endoftext|>My 2 cents: The Franklin coverup is a fascinating conspiracy that involves government and government paymaster malfeasance. Some day when powerful bad guys are dead some witnesses are going to talk and even more really horrible truths are going be revealed but the evidence trail will have decayed to uselessness by that point and these truths may never be proven. Satanic cults are a real thing but they are insignificant in the systemic corruption that weighs us all down. For almost all practical purposes magic is a weapon of the weak; when the rich and powerful want to make things happen they don't waste their time with magic. Satanism is an edge case and there is a wide spectrum from the people who do Left Hand Path practices all the time to people who do so once in great while for a special project where they think it is the right tool for this job and it is not the right tool for almost all of the magic ends they usually pursue. Most occultists are, to be honest, losers. They have shit jobs and occupy dumps and drive beater cars and their magic is a largely self-delusion that they aren't such a loser. Apropos to Crowley if you live in a big city you can go to an open OTO meeting and see this for yourself. Aleister Crowley was like a lot of people who are very smart and read great books and know a lot of stuff and if they could have just paired up with a professional editor their books might be great instead of being barely readable. It is never a chore to read a great book. It is a chore to read Aleister Crowley. There is a small percentage of really great content hidden in that mess but it can be exhausting to pry it out of all the crap. The traditional explanation of it's concealed and revealed, or it has to be obfuscated to keep it away from the unworthy is bullshit. My favorite Crowley story is the one in Webb's book where he spent a week at Gurdjieff's commune and infuriated the other guru who expected everybody to be respectful and pitch in and do their fair share of the work. G. G. was a hospitable host as his upbringing required but the minute Crowley left the instruction was recorded the moocher was never allowed back. The only essential Crowley books are, in order, 777, Thoth, and Book IV. If you go through the hassle of reading these three books you will have 99% of all quality Crowley. Here and there scattered through them is some really great stuff. Organized in reverse order to A. C., Satanism, and Franklin posted above as the relevance of these three subjects to this sub is presented upside down. :)
<|endoftext|>Jason A's youtube channel recently did a short video on Satan, rock bands and Aleister Crowley. Warning as Jason A's stuff has religious undertones (which I don't mind, but some may) but the information is solid.He discusses AC/DC, Led Zepplin, Hendrix, The Beetles and many many others who are not only quoted as saying they 'worship Satan' or that they automatically wrote songs that they claim they did not write - but also all these bands adoration for Aleister Crowley (some knowing him personally) and his philosophies. Jason A has religious context, his videos are some of the best being produced on YouTube today. He never speaks himself, but only shows lectures, sermons, news broadcasts and articles to make you think and connect the dots yourself. You come to your own conclusions from the multiple sources he presents.
<|endoftext|>I've always been confused with Aleister Crowley being the poster boy of Hermeticism. Isn't he the same Aleister Crowley who committed ritual abuse? The cult advocate? How could he be associated something as pure as spiritual alchemy?
<|endoftext|>Pizzagate, the topic with the majority of the votes every roundtable, is a honorable mention! The true conspiracy is always in the posts!
<|endoftext|>**Jack Parsons** and **L. Ron Hubbard** both basically worshipped Crowley, and together did many **Satanic Magickal Workings**
<|endoftext|>I do believe Winston Chruchill enlisted his services to counter possible ancient rites and magick utilized by the Nazis?
<|endoftext|>Is there a list of links for photos and video of modern day examples? (Ex. That weird CERN opening ritual, podesta with that goat head mask, etc?) Anyone have good photo/vid proofs?
<|endoftext|>No, not the Franklin cover up. That scares me and gave me nightmares and my relative was involved. Supposedly just associated with one of the main people but I have my fears based on personal knowledge. I never hear anyone talking about this so I was startled to see it here. It's horrible horrible horrible. 
<|endoftext|>I will be reading through this one. Dont forget ACs ties to Jack Parsons, and Parsons relationship with L. Ron Hubbard. 
<|endoftext|>Mark Passio covers Crowley in detail on his podcasts and interviews, great info for anyone looking for more 
<|endoftext|>Many Cults believe in melding beliefs, try to summon power, and try to use distorted interpretations to their advantage. My point - not just Satan. The Satanic Panic was a vert successful campaign. Many people have been terrified. Shit's recycled.
<|endoftext|>''Black magic is not a myth. It is a totally unscientific and emotional form of magic, but it does get results  of an extremely temporary nature. The recoil upon those who practice it is terrific. It is like looking for an escape of gas with a lighted candle. As far as the search goes, there is little fear of failure!To practice black magic you have to violate every principle of science, decency, and intelligence. You must be obsessed with an insane idea of the importance of the petty object of your wretched and selfish desires. I have been accused of being a "black magician." No more foolish statement was ever made about me. I despise the thing to such an extent that I can hardly believe in the existence of people so debased and idiotic as to practice it.''The few times Crowley did practice black magick (which is not a part of his magical system in the least), it did recoil terribly on him.

<|endoftext|>also remember Aleister Crowley's role in Rocketry and the Scientology movement. After a brief involvement with Marxism in 1939, Parsons converted to Thelema, the English occultist Aleister Crowley's new religious movement. In 1941, alongside his first wife Helen Northrup, Parsons joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). At Crowley's bidding, he replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons was expelled from JPL and Aerojet in 1944 due to the Lodge's infamy and allegedly illicit activities, along with his hazardous workplace conduct.In 1945 Parsons separated from Helen after having an affair with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952, Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or assassination.
<|endoftext|>Unfortunately, Ted is not a reliable source of intel:  also loved to shill William Guy Carr. 
<|endoftext|>Kenneth Anger and Hollywood vogue occultism is a far cry from, say, Manley P Hall and his goals. California has had stretched, dirivitive occultism since the turn of the century with the "bohemians." Most of it is made up shit so they can collect mummies and wear cool robes. You think I'm kidding.  
<|endoftext|>[More on Manson and Boys Town]( the Los Angeles ranch where his "Family" stayed was adjacent to another ranch owned by an influential Omaha businessman who funded Boys Town.
<|endoftext|>Duality is a masterpiece if anyone ever fancies a listen, this background info on the whole thing is incredibly interesting. I am about to research Kenneth Anger now so I will report back with findings.
<|endoftext|>All that matters is getting the point across that moral relativism does not exist.You ( or the plural government you) don't get to commit violence. JustThe same anyone else.
<|endoftext|>I LOVE that you reminded that some of this could be disinfo. This thread is seriously a breath of fresh air. Great, level arguments on both sides. Thank you for your work! 
<|endoftext|>I can't speak for anyone who believes in "anonymous" or for anyone in this sub.I can tell you that the Crowley quote you referenced is often shortened in its references. The entire quote is "do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. LOVE is the law, LOVE under will..."This changes the meaning entirely. The will of man should be entirely supported by . This is only one interpretation I've heard and just thought I would share.
<|endoftext|>V also has "Vi Veri Vniversvm Vivvs Vici" in the "Shadow Gallery", which is a motto of Crowley's for the Magister Templi. However, the phrase was used in "Faust" also, which is from whom V says it originates.
<|endoftext|>I have trouble supporting Anon, and one reason is connected with your point - their activities promote chaos, just like the line "do as thou wilst." Chaos is a powerful and easy tool for destruction. It simply speeds up entropy by introducing randomness into a system, whereas bringing order requires much more energy and skill.Another problem I have with Anon is their sign-off, where they say "we are Legion, for we are many." That is straight from the Bible, in Mark 5:9, where Jesus is confronting the demon within the madman at the tombs. Jesus asks the demon its name, and it answers, "We are Legion, for we are many."Demonic forces are subtle, and can operate within groups completely undetected. I think Anon is a group of usefull, unwitting tools being wielded by a master manipulator.
<|endoftext|>You're absolutely right. There should not be idolizing of Crowley. He himself said he hated having fan boys and girls. He wanted people to carve their own spiritual path.
<|endoftext|> He died penniless and alone.  This is true, and he predicted in "Liber ABA" that this would be the case. He exerted all his effort and money into producing and distributing his works above all else, which I daresay is admirable, not worthy of contempt. Think of all the losers in history who died after only doing things anyone else could have, and then look at the unique and bizaare reputation of Crowley, his work, etc.  Also, fucking Listverse is not a good source. For anything. The first bullet is already wrong. According to Crowley's own bio in Liber ABA, he does list his first sexual *act* at 14 - with a *guy*. He lists his first sexual *act* with a *female* at 16, with a "theatre girl", not a maid. Number 7 is just insulting to anyone who understands the distinction between bisexuality and homosexuality. Number 6 is completely retarded - he used the *symbol* of the Holy Guardian Angel because, according to his own description in Liber ABA, he didn't think anyone was stupid enough to take it seriously. He also didn't consider Aiwass to be that symbol until late in his life. (The HGA is actually part of the self, according to Crowley, not a literal angel.) Number 5 is completely stupid - "Fact: it is *rumored*" Well then it's not a damn fact! 4 is correct, for the most part, save that it makes him sound like he died of heroin overdose. He didn't, he died of kidney failure that was bound to be his death since childhood, as he had poor kidneys from birth. 3 and 2 are correct, but number 1 is again completely stupid. It's a rumor based on idiocy and Crowley's reputation rather than any legitimate source.  However, /u/ToHeliopolisWithLove is correct, and he didn't want to be treated as another plaster saint. I do believe he had something legitimate to teach, however.
<|endoftext|>This penniless and alone shit is a bulkshit trope trotted out whenever Crowley is mentioned. The man made it to end. Hes a failure because he squandered his wealth instead of saving it? He had visitors up until the very end. I would venture to say the man most likely accomplished more before 30 than you ever will in your entire life. I could be wrong, maybe people will be discussing you on the internet and writing books about you 70 years from now. 
<|endoftext|> He died penisless and alone.Ironically, he did sustain an injury to the perimeum when ice skating as a teenager, which pained him for the rest of his life. 
<|endoftext|>Ive heard from multiple sources that saying Ive heard from multiple sources will get you downvotes. Have one on me.
<|endoftext|>The mongols just took over Hungary and slaughtered 140,000. Just some perspective, definitely interesting times, I just think dark might be a touch heavy. ;)
<|endoftext|>This. *Occultism* has gotten an incredibly bad rap. Sure, some things *branded* occult knowledge have some interesting layers, but oftentimes it had to be hidden by whatever elite rulers were at the top at the time.
<|endoftext|>However, dark occultism (I.e. Those who would purposefully hide the truth for nefarious purposes) does tend to tie into satanism/Crowleyism. I am not a Christian per se, but I am using satanism in reference to those who put their selves above all others and those who believe in moral relativism.
<|endoftext|>Exactly. Most equates to a modern day practice of mystery religions in general. Occultism is as broad a term as Religion. Let's not pretend modern, mainstream religions are somehow exempt from "ritualistic murder and rape of children".
<|endoftext|>On further review I found a passage in Webb's *The Occult Underground* which is appropriate for people curious about the subject of black magic in high places.  Huysmans, in the words of one of his contemporaries, had a terrible tendency "to believe what he read," and his suggestibility was to lead to further ramifications. The novelist's friend Jules Bois, a journalist, who shared his interest in occult matters, possessed the same credulity. He was later to print documents given by Boullan to Huysmans containing the information that at every court of Europe magical evocations were practiced, and that Prussia crushed France at Sedan because of her superior evocatory powers. p.158-9 Webb was a scholar and a skeptic. If you follow the footnotes in this book you may find the best documentation on the subject. That is the place where I would start. *The Harmonious Circle* is the Webb book where you can find the dope on Crowley. Why Webb would exert all of this energy on topics which he dismissed as rubbish is a mystery, but I am glad that he did and it is a pity that he died so young.
<|endoftext|> some knowing him personally)This Jason A sounds full of shit. None of those bands were old enough to know Crowley personally, unless you think a 7 year old John Lennon was chilling with Crowley on Aleister's deathbed. Read the biographies of these bands like Hammer of the Gods for Zeppelin and you'd know these recycled 1980s crazy christian claims are moronic.
<|endoftext|>I agree. Been following him for more than a year.One of the good ones left in youtube.There used to be many. 
<|endoftext|>He's definitely the poster boy for certain Hermetic orders, but really I think he is his own "poster boy", if anything.Crowley is one of the most well known but least understood individuals of the 20th century. His works are prolific and not exactly easy to approach and absorb. I would take any anecdotal accounts and/or personal interpretations of his work with a grain of salt. Find the substantiated evidence of him being involved in "ritual abuse" (Do you mean ala MK-ULTRA?) and I'll consider it, it's just most stories I've read involving him and abuse are dubious at best.
<|endoftext|>Since prehistoric times, we have generally acted like it is somehow our divine right to trash up their beautiful and immeasurably valuable planet. Since industrialization we've been systematically destroying the planet as if that were our civilization's primary purpose.What makes you think that this is an intrinsic human trait, and isn't something that is manufactured? 
<|endoftext|>Hang on, you said "christian's ideas should be based on the first god's opinions of the second, so they should be wrong." I'm not exactly following your logic here. Why should they be wrong? Just because they believe the first god's opinions? So what makes the second god's opinions right? The fact that he's second? Sorry if I'm totally missing it, but that one whooshed right over my head.
<|endoftext|>I have struggled to find the quote ever since I read it, but I recall someone close to Crowley stating that, in their opinion, Crowley was destroyed by the Magick itself. Are you familiar with the quote? I would love to have it available for discussions like this in future. 
<|endoftext|>Can you cite any specific examples of black magicians that have successfully performed magick, and also the implied recoils?
<|endoftext|>Crowley ate shit, called himself "the great beast 666", bragged about sodomizing his daughter, fucked goats, slit a goats throat during intercoarse with his partner, of which many killed themselves. I mean... jeez, u say "the few times crowley did practice black magick" - his whole life was about defaming God after his Dad died randomly as a child. He was going to be a preacher but got so enraged at his fathers untimely death that he took it upon himself to desecrate all that he could. Any decent person wouldn't JOKE with you about anything this guy does... 
<|endoftext|>As someone who knows little to nothing regarding these topics, Im curious; are these links purporting to prove the existence of magic and the occult? Or the power of the occult? And is there anything definitive or provable to back any claims or stories?Quite the collection you have here regardless. 
<|endoftext|>From mere descriptions of L. Ron's behavior, Crowley identified that he was a con man, writing in a letter, "Suspect Ron playing confidence trick -- Jack Parsons weak fool -- obvious victim prowling swindlers." Hubbard had an ability to totally charm some people, but at the expense of being completely transparent to others.
<|endoftext|>This facet of Crowley is probably the best fit for /r/conspiracy. It is substantiated, has a lot of juicy and salacious details and involves a high-level individual wrapped up in a weird esoteric practice. Not to mention the twisty-turney line of connections that Hubbard and Parsons both had throughout government/technology and business at the time.Hubbard was a flim-flam man and Parsons may have been one of his earliest victims. 
<|endoftext|>A man who has the credentials to prove he was FBI and a creator in CoIntelPro, with documented history of other whistleblowers backing his credentials, like Gene Tatum who helped reveal the Oliver North scandal, you are trying to say that this massive conspiracy he showed all of his work for, is wrong because you don't support the results of the tunnels. Can you discredit all the info in his reports? Or just try to tarnish the name and thus the whole conspiracy by association?
<|endoftext|>Wait a second, but is your ISGP article supposed to discredit Ted Gunderson?  Seriously, have you actually listened to the man speak or read any of his writing? If you're casting shade on Gunderson, that article did little to nothing to cause me to doubt him. For anyone else reading this, just listen to Gunderson speak on some of these topics, read the ISGP article and other criticisms of him if you so choose, and come to an informed decision. I found him highly credible and definitely didn't get the impression he was in it for money or personal recognition, but what do I know.Edit: a couple words
<|endoftext|>Thank you for the additional read. I was blown away when i made the connection, I'm glad it actually goes a little deeper.
<|endoftext|> ; it looks like it was on netflix at one point.
<|endoftext|>Hm. K. Well, you can throw the word love in there, but it's still putting your own will above everything else. The very definition of selfishness. That is not good, or loving. Putting others above yourself and your own will, is.
<|endoftext|>Thank you for your in depth knowledge. I honestly just posted that source to make the joke, I didnt fact check.I agree with you, he did have something legitimate to teach. I truely enjoyed reading **some** of his work.
<|endoftext|>That has nothing to do with the fact that he was a degenerate. All of that talent and intelligence used to harm people, even people from his own congregation, with baneful magick. Im glad his life backfired on him. While were at it lets laud Hitlers accomplishments too. Heck of a painter. 
<|endoftext|>I never said he was a failure. Or that he didnt accomplish anything. I said I don't like how people idolize him.I didn't want to shit on the guy but he liked to write about being shit on. So tell me more about how you love his work. Its not that good. And the parts that are good are not even his own novel ideas. Go get your pitchfork."Churn on me, Leah! Twist on your thighs! Smear diarrhoea Into my eyes! Splutter out shit From the bottomless pit." - Aleister imsoaccomplished Crowley3rd edit - I respect the man to some extent. I just wish people knew who someone like say, Dame Frances Yates is to accociate with hermetic work and occult rather then Crowely.
<|endoftext|>140,000? We have 8,000,000,000 people living on Earth now. All it takes is 1 disaster... Could be a deadly flu, could be war/depopulation. Sure it may seem ok to some, but to most of us paying attention to the real world vs reality TV see that we are headed for dark times ahead and are doing so little to prepare.
<|endoftext|>indeed. not all of it is evil, not all of it has been corrupted. that being said, there are some that do practice very self serving rituals. there are those that spill blood, sometimes their own... sometimes not. there are sex rituals. there are coming of age rituals. there are fertility rituals. they are not mutually exclusive, nor are they all the same.there are some people that seek to gain favor from certain entities, (i believe they exist, i dont ask anyone else to, most importantly, THEY DO,) some have an affinity for bacchus may offer wine, and orgies. some may love ganesh, fruit, flowers... moloch/melech. baal. belial. 
<|endoftext|>What is by pretending to be "satanists" they scare people into christianity which may be another system they invented, that way they still have you by the balls.
<|endoftext|>Jason A isn't the man giving the lecture, he's the one who puts together the videos of others speaking. You are right that none of the bands I listed met him personally, but his teachings were very important to them (placing Crowley on their album covers and-the-like).  It does not discredit facts like Page kidnapping a 14 year old or 100's of other allegations against him (in regards to sleeping with underage girls). He's praised yet is just as bad as anyone from pedogate.
<|endoftext|>From West, north Texas and nowhere NM, the noble savage thing is definitely a myth, I've been to buffalo runs, and that whole "they used errything" bit is malarky. Just because most of the native Americans trash wasn't our environment destroying atrocities doesn't mean they didn't leave it all over the place. I've tons of arrowheads I've found. They woulda got there eventually. 
<|endoftext|>Not original commenter, but I'll respond.It is not inherent. This is why Christianity (the institution) has prospered (literally), as a monetary feast upon the collective guilt these masses feel.
<|endoftext|>It's not really aimed at proving or disproving any point in particular, rather to share the wealth of information that exists on these subjects for others to examine objectively and subsequently form their own conclusions. One point that can be taken away from the bulk of this content, while broad and covering a variety of inter-related and at times unrelated material, is the existence of certain currents or streams of esoteric (e.g. occult) knowledge passed through the centuries through key adepts, as well as their pupils and obscured often allegorically, when not utilized explicitly, by esoteric initiatory orders and secret societies. This was initially done out of necessity, to avoid persecution by the authorities of their time, and to prevent this knowledge from being abused potentially. At this point in history such an approach is no longer considered necessary, for the most part, hence the abundance and accessibly of such knowledge in the present day.To quote Immanuel Kant, who apparently plagiarized the phrase from Horace I say: Sapere aude! (Dare to know!). And to quote the infamous Aleister Crowley, who had in turn plagiarized Francois Rebelais and the Hellfire Clubs who came before him I say: Do what thou wilt! Though I would add to that, as a matter of personal preference, the hippocratic oath, in the form of: Do what thou wilt and do no harm. Speaking of esotericism, exoterically or superficially the phrase 'do what thou wilt' would appear to simply mean 'do what you want' which can be partially accurate but misses the broader and underlying meaning of the phrase. The key word in that phrase is wilt, or will, a reference to the philosophy of Thelema and of one's True Will, that is one's true and sole purpose for existence. When taken into proper context, the phrase, as intended by Crowley and possibly those before him, was meant to be regarded as an imperative to find your True Will or purpose and to strive toward that purpose in every aspect of your life, above all other priorities, apprehensions, dogmas, laws or societal norms. Of course, that phrase can and has been misused by some who wish to rationalize their own indefensible or hedonistic behavior, which if not truly their purpose or constructive toward that purpose is something that will ultimately work against them, not solely ethically or karmically (for those who consider that relevant) but in how it reflects on their character and credibility, not just in their position in their respective community or society as a whole but by their contemporaries as well as those above them in their respective hierarchy.
<|endoftext|>Gunderson isn't a primary source for any of the shit he talks about, with the notable exception of the McMartin tunnel. It seems more than likely the tunnel was a hoax, and I also find it EXTREMELY troubling that he's recommending William Guy Carr as THE GO TO SOURCE for information. Carr flat out lied about some pretty heavy shit, aside from the fact that pretty much nothing in his book is sourced, at all. So, yeah, I'm saying "be careful who you listen to". 
<|endoftext|>Pop culture vs. Academia. Even though a good portion of MPHs stuff has been refuted by historians, he was in it for the history and knowledge not fame. It's much the same as Jared Diamond vs. Actual historians. 
<|endoftext|> I'm glad it actually goes a little deeper.On the one hand, I'm glad when my suspicions can be validated. On the other, I sometimes wish I was completely wrong. Realizing the truth of all this was the biggest worldview-shattering experience I ever had, and it messed me up for well over a year.
<|endoftext|>No, that is not what is meant by the first law of Thelema, which is the quote above.Crowley was indeed a questionable character and he often didn't practice what he preached. And who knows what he truly practiced, the man's life was and still is in many ways shrouded in mystery.Regardless, that phrase still holds within it one of the deepest and most beautiful spiritual truths you can utter. [I actually made a comment a while back on this topic in a thread on CST]( Let me copy it here (slightly edited), since it is relevant to the discussion:-----------------------------------------------Crowley's fundamental [law of Thelema]( was: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will."Although Crowley himself, as even Mark Passio once stated, is a man that one should listen to, but not copy in his actions (as he often lived quite a hedonistic lifestyle, perhaps not totally in alignment with his main teachings), this "law" is something I see very frequently as being misunderstood.By "Do what thou wilt" or "Do what you will", Crowley is implying that every being should follow their fundamental, core will, the Will that is intertwined with the whole of the Cosmos. When you follow your core Will (which is something most people are obviously **not** doing, given the state of the world), you are coming from a place of Unity. When you come from Unity your will is aligned with the will of every other being, thus following this core will, or Will, is actually one of the greatest spiritual keys and practices(this is also perhaps why he doesn't say "do what you want", but says "do what you will").Aligning yourself with your Core Will or True Will (as he states in the quote below), which is interconnected with the whole Cosmos, is one of the main keys to any spiritual practice, if not perhaps the main key.In the other part of the law he mentions "Love is the Law, love under will", which is again related to what I'm saying above. You could say that love and Will are in a way intertwined. The more Will is sourced from your Core, the more it is connected to and with love, even if the love is a mere spark, or perhaps more a sense of compassion, peace, stillness, presence.This is another quote from Crowley that shows this is what he is actually saying:"Do not repress or restrict any true instinct of your Nature; but devote all in perfection to the sole service of your one True Will."- Aleister Crowley, Another quote from him that is quite interesting:"IT IS WRITTEN that 'Love is the law, love under will.' Herein is an Arcanum concealed, for in the Greek Language [Agape], Love, is of the same numerical value as [Thelema], Will. By this we understand that the Universal Will is of the nature of Love. Now Love is the enkindling in ecstacy of Two that will to become One. It is thus an Universal formula of High Magick. For see now how all things, being in sorrow caused by dividuality, must of necessity will Oneness as their medicine... Understand now that in yourselves is a certain discontent. Analyse well its nature: at the end is in every case one conclusion. The ill springs from the belief in two things, the Self and the Not-Self, and the conflict between them. This also is a restriction of the Will. He who is sick is in conflict with his own body: he who is poor is at odds with society: and so for the rest. Ultimately, therefore, the problem is how to destroy this perception of duality, to attain to the apprehension of unity.- Aleister Crowley,Good sources on Thelema that I just found through Google (linked stuff pertinent to this discussion):

<|endoftext|>I think this is close. I think they might have created Christianity as a veil for Satanism. They convince the masses to pray and god will save them. They are the "prey".Meanwhile the satanists are very organized and put to action their plans instead of preying that they come to pass. Religion is another way to make apathetic victims.

<|endoftext|>academia and pop culture seemed to have blended. What of Manly Pee Holes stuff was proven to be wrong by historians ? 
<|endoftext|>Exactly. Which is why the stupid quote is contradictory. Love under will...sounds like will ranks first. No room for love if you've already ranked yourself above it.
<|endoftext|> "Do not repress or restrict any true instinct of your Nature; but devote all in perfection to the sole service of your one True Will." - Well here's the problem then. If you don't believe that giving in to our own instincts is going to lead to selfishness and greed, not sure how to even discuss these quotes with you. Look around this world and tell me if people giving in to their own instincts has done any good at all. Sounds like Crowley was following these words just fine. You are being deceived, my friend. If I'm wrong, show me some followers of this philosophy that are just bursting at the seams with goodness and love for their fellow man. You won't. This is the opposite of love.

<|endoftext|>It was during his second K2 attempt. K2 is no joke, even today something like 1 in 5 people die climbing that mountain. It may be seen as a heartless thing to do (leaving someone to die) but in that kind of situation, what other choice do you have? Keeping in mind that K2 really does not have flat sections; and you need to have true technical climbing skills. In my opinion, if you help, you probably end up dead as well.

<|endoftext|>"Make apathetic victims"A comedian was just talking about this... A religious person will say something was "the will of god", and "God works in mysterious ways". Pretty good cuz the comedian said if anyone else went to their job and worked in "mysterious ways" they would be fired lol...But really "turn the other cheek"? Might as well work a shitty job for some rich fuck, if your going to heaven anyways right.
<|endoftext|>Your bias is showing. It has nothing to do with Christians.. you can look up many other sources who say the same exact thing. Let me ask you.. what then, if other sources who have nothing to do with religion or Christianity have said as much (lots of articles from many news sources have reported on him kidnapping a 14 year old until she was old enough to be released)? Would you then denounce them on some faulty premise too?
<|endoftext|>Well now you've piqued my interest, mentioning a symbol of particular importance to me not just now but throughout my life, the Seal of Solomon. Most theories along this line tend to not pan out, or will take vague correlations to form a contrived narrative or pet theory. On the other hand, I have yet to find a rabbit hole I will not explore. I know that sounded foul after I typed it, but it's true, technically.
<|endoftext|>I'd disagree, just because geographic determinism is popular doesn't mean actual historians give it any creedance. Why do you say that? Ugh I've read a pretty darn good article on that if I can find it. Right off the top of my head historians now very much downplay and attribute to several different cults what he attributed to Mitra. He built quite a bit off the Mitra cults and there's very strong evidence against those lines of the mystery schools now. 
<|endoftext|>Again, interpretation is everything.Will doesn't mean self or your will to do something. It means actual action in this sense. As in, do what you do in love (as opposed to fear or hate). Again, this is just an alternative explanation. That does not mean that everyone who "follows Crowley" or wears "do what thou wilt" on a t-shirt believes that interpretation.
<|endoftext|>Re-read my comment again. I never said one should follow their instincts, that is not what is meant by the phrase "true-will". And neither does Crowley mean that, as he states that this will comes from your Nature (capitalized - thus this means your deep self, not your surface avatar/persona or your physical animalistic self)."True-will", in this interpretation (in the spiritual and esoteric sense) is meant as your core will beyond your egoic instinctual, primal or selfish desires. Beyond what you want only for yourself there are desires within you that are born as a result of your innermost nature, which is intertwined and in unity with the whole Cosmos. Your deepest desires, you will find, are actually not only your own. If you meditate, introspect and look deeply enough within, you will find a will, a source of desire that is your own and personal, yet also transpersonal. This is reflective of your deepest nature as an inntrinsic part (as well as paradoxically the whole) of the Divine web that is weaved out of all things that exist.To put it simply- what you *really* want, from a deep place within, from beyond the ego, from beyond pure separation, yet still from an individuated standpoint (paradoxically intertwined with the whole), is what the whole Cosmos, the whole of reality wants as well. Creating and acting from that place is inevitably acting in love, with the energy of love. For love is a hallmark of unity, not of separation.You are not not just a drop in the ocean, you are the entirety of the ocean. You are both the drop and the sea, the part and the whole. And coming your deepest self is also coming to your deepest will - your "true-will" as Crowley states it. That will is your own both from your individual standpoint as well as from the standpoint of the whole, the bigger you.That is why following your true will is what gives birth to a deeper realization of yourself and your ultimate/deeper unity with the all. Knowing who you are, knowing what you truly want - all these things are connected, one realization leads to another. And all of the realizations inevitably lead to and are linked with - love. 
<|endoftext|>I think you're still missing the point of what is meant by "will" in the quote. It is not about "giving in to our instincts", but about finding a deeper connection with nature, life, God, the Dao, whatever you want to call it, and allowing that connection to guide you. Wikipedia has a pretty good [short summary on True Will]( that might help.It's not meant to encourage hedonism, and I think it's unfair to let Crowley's lifestyle detract from his writings. It's possible to understand a truth and still be unable to follow it; there are plenty of priests from any religion I could point to as example (or even my own fat ass, with all its knowledge of diet & exercise). Sometimes knowledge isn't enough to stifle the desire for a vice.

<|endoftext|>They way he explained the freemason 1st tracing (I'm not a mason but I assume that is what they do) to the DC monument on Dec 25. Incredible 
<|endoftext|>Glad you agree and are aware of his work. Just felt the need to add this:He is not just a EX-satanic priest. He is the most well-read occultist out there actively trying to spread wisdom and knowledge. He is literally the only person I have found who not only lays out the "what" of occultism, but on The Who, when, where and why it is being occulted and and to what nefarious end. People need to wake up and take accountability for their own ignorance and actions. 
<|endoftext|> have Google right? What the fuck am I doing here
<|endoftext|>Possibly, however bare in mind with esoteric symbols there are typically multiple meanings, or layers of meanings, attributed to them. I would take any unconfirmed theories with a grain of salt, consider it in degrees of plausibility, see how it stacks up to corroborating evidence and keep an open mind. At minimum, it makes for a fascinating thought experiment, something to contemplate objectively.

<|endoftext|>Hey everybody. So I've been into theories of ancient civilizations ever since I discovered Graham Hancock, but today I wanted to link you guys to a crazy thread that really blew my mind.[Alterwelt's "Remote Viewing" of the past]( some backstory. So this guy started a thread on Godlike Productions' forum saying he can remote view ancient civilizations. His username was Alterwelt and he allowed users to post questions.The threads that followed are fucking crazy. Even if what he said wasn't true, it is incredibly fascinating. I wish everything he said could be made into a crazy book series.I haven't been able to get it off my mind ever since. Let me know what you guys think.EDIT: Here is an example of a Q&A from a later thread (There were several reaching close to 300 pages for some threads)Question: Who built Puma Punku?Answer: The first structures were built over 32.000 years ago by the colonists from the atlantic landmasses.The sites were abandoned after a global war and left desolate for almost 12.000 years, then some 18.000 to 16.000 years B.C it was rebuilt by the second wave of colonists from the Atlantic.It then served as a great port for the ships arriving to the region via lake Titicaca and a landing base for airships travelling deeper inland.After the Younger Dryas it's population was wiped out by the flood and earthquakes, finally some 9.000 years B.C it was resettled again by a small group of survivors from one of the last civilized areas in the Atlantic, these were driven off by the distant ancestors of the Aymara Indians and scattered across South America leaving the site desolate.If you guys find Alterwelts thread from 2014 interesting, I can try and dig up the other ones. I think there's maybe 2-3 total starting in 2014, with the above question being from a thread of his from 2016.EDIT - I started a post with all the links to every thread from Alterwelt in case anyone wanted it all in one place. Enjoy!
<|endoftext|>If anyone wants to read a serious intellectual book which will convince you of the merits of Atlantis existing in the past I suggest *Cataclysm: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C* by D S Allan and J B Delair. It goes through geological and mythological evidence, is sourced and cited in an academic manner and contains a wealth of information on the subject. After reading this I was amazed it wasn't common knowledge given all the evidence in favour of it. If you are a hardcore skeptic and want scientific evidence that Atlantis once existed in this world read this book. I have an old thread broadstroking it [here]( as well as a link to an ebook version of the book :).

<|endoftext|>I am fascinated by this subject. Recently, I read "Lemuria: Lost Continent of the Pacific" by Wishar Cerve (actually a nom de plume for H. Spencer Lewis). It is a fascinating book, which lead me to Mt. Shasta and the [Klamath Falls petroglyphs.]( did some more research and found a striking similarity to petroglyphs located at [Lake Winnemucca, Nevada]( and [Painted Rock, California.]( after doing a little more digging, I found a resemblance to the [Caroline Islands Script]( from the South Pacific, near Papua New Guinea.

<|endoftext|>Just finished reading *The History of Atlantis* and *Occult Science in Atlantis* by Lewis Spence. Almost finished with *Atlantis: Mother of Empires* by Robert Stacy-Judd. These are must reads for anyone interested in the subject, in my opinion.Both researchers theorize that there were three major waves of immigration from Atlantis to Europe and the Americas corresponding to three great cataclysms suffered by Atlantis, along with periodic colonization of both areas in between. These cataclysms and subsequent waves occurred in approximately 23,000 BC, 14,000 BC, and 9,600 BC, with the latter being the final cataclysm described by Plato in the Timaeus and Critias. These three waves correspond to the Aurignacian, Magdalenian, and Azilian-Tardenoisian cultures in Europe, respectively. They also correspond to the pre-Mound Builders, Mound Builders, Toltecs, Aztecs, and Mayans in America.Curious to hear if anyone else has read these books, and what there take on them is!
<|endoftext|>I think that the Biblical flood, and many other floods in our collective history have been caused by a 2nd star in our solar system, a dead black star passing through our inner solar system every few thousand years. I also think that it's due to come back around soon, and that David Bowie hid its location on the vinyl version of his Blackstar album. There is an image of a star field on it that was found some time after the album came out that can only be seen in UV light. I also think that this is the biggest secret of all of the secret societies like the Freemasons, that they have kept from us "profane" for millenia. Tubal-Cain is the password of the Master Mason and IMO alludes to this concept in an allegorical way. Here's a link to an article that mentions the album Blackstar having more secrets to be revealed think that if we were to point a sufficiently powerful telescope towards the center of the included image which was cropped from this larger image we might be able to detect it in time to prepare for its inevitable return.

<|endoftext|>Does anyone know about in depth research on Aboriginal Australian memory sticks? There is some mainstream work i heard about on the Mysterious Universe. They had the author of the Memory Code, Lynne Kelly, as a guest and she mentioned some interesting things about the Aboriginal timeline. She also mentioned that while there is no true written history there are sticks passed generation to generation that go back 10s of thousands of years. The book was a good start but it tries to take on too much in too little space. I would like to find a good place to start to see if there is a connection between memory sticks, the French cave paintings, and imagery in the southwest United States. From what little in the way of decent sources I found I think there may be far better tangible evidence for a great civilization at least 50,000 years ago. I think that due to their isolation the Aboriginal history may be an outstanding resource. Over time this has eroded, but not as much as say ancient African or Middle Eastern history. The problem I have is a majority of easy to find material is written with the modern bias of written civilization being 6,000 years old. If anyone knows of anything specific to Australia that would help me get started I would appreciate it. 
<|endoftext|>I have the perfect thing for this topic actually... a Canadian Atlantis (along with some other curious geo formations).When I was browsing the global map, I saw a circular ring shaped land mass that reminded me a bit of the classic descriptions of Atlantis. The neat, circular design of the ring shape makes me think it was deliberately designed and could possibly be Atlantis or some other similar advanced city. I haven't seen this area discussed much by other people either... its a very odd, unnatural looking crater in Canada called Manicougan crater:Wiki:   just doesn't seem like a natural formation to me cause comets/asteroids usually make craters at an angle (so oval/irregular shape) and usually cause a crater depression that would cause a pit that gets deeper toward the center, which would form a lake or something but this crater is a ring shape, where the land in the center is raised/normal instead of more caved in and a ring of water around it like a moat. As I was doing more research I found out that it also has a dam to contain the water in the reservoir and was surprised to find out that I recognized it from something..... the Weapon X program in the Wolverine Origins movie! Its the same dam that wolverine was locked up in for mutant experiments, and I have seen that dam used in other movies/shows as well (usually in an ominous setting). I actually think there is a real secret government base in there, along with some mysterious history to the location itself, which is what inspired those movie producers to include the dam in their films. It could be ancient atlantis that has been covered up to hide their technology and keep it secret, or an underground government base/bunker, or even something alien related where they used it as a stargate or visual marker and use the site for secret genetic testing. Could be a variety of things, but I just can't see it being a simple meteorite crater from what I see. I've actually considered making a road trip up there to check it out myself in person, esp that inner circle of the "Eye of Quebec". I'm sure exploring the area would be worth it regardless, prob find some ancient artifacts or meteorite rocks.... maybe get abducted and given mutant powers, or just plain abducted which would kinda suck lol. I have always thought Canada has some secrets that haven't been discovered yet, or are intentionally being kept hidden. I find it interesting that they have such strict rules for crossing the border into Canada, so like people with a DUI or certain "flags" won't be allowed in... they're very selective. There is also tons of wild territory that has not been fully explored with only a few small settlements around. Most of the population of Canadians lives in the bottom 1/3 of the country, while the top 2/3 is wild Yukon territory that only the native inuit "First Nations" Indians live in.First Nations and the "Canadian Shield" geographic area is another point too cause I think the First Nations tribes have a very ancient historical past in the north that isn't publicized much but shows up in their beliefs. With climate/pole shifts that whole northern arctic area could have been more habitable in the past like they say about antarctica. The whole Canadian shield area in general seems kinda odd to me too with its unique shield shape... you can tell that it used to be one land mass that was shattered into smaller pieces by meteorites. There is that theory about a huge meteorite that could have crashed and created the Hudson bay and then broke off into smaller pieces multiple times as it arced downward, making the great lakes and other smaller lakes in Midwest/east coast of US. Aside from that tho, there are other known meteorite sites up there that are mined for ore and even give off magnetic anomalies. Its just a strange area. But yea... Canada has some interesting and mysterious features that I hope we will learn more about eventually. 
<|endoftext|>[A fun one - the flying machine found under the pyramids](
<|endoftext|>My theory on Atlantis:According to what I've read, it was supposed to be due West of the straight of Gibraltar and be around 230miles by 345 miles large (measured in stades). I forget where I read it, but it was also a few day boat ride to get there, which based on Roman boats, that would place it around the Portuguese Azores area. If you look in Google earth, there is a land mass of roughly 345 miles wide and 230miles tall. The problem is that even if you account for a 400 ft rise in sea level, it still would be under water. This is where a recent discovery helps us out. If you look into the pyramids found off the coast of Cuba, you will see a city that is 2000ft below sea level. You might ask why this matters. If you look at tectonic plates, this is on the edge between the north American plate and the plate right below. Guess what! The location of Atlantis in the azores is also on the edge of the tectonic plate between north america and the plate to the east. How could the whole ridge be raised you ask? Well it is like a boat on an ocean of magma with a huge iceberg on the northern side. When this was destroyed at the end of the ice age 10800 years ago (Thanks Graham Hancock), this caused the whole plate to level itself. Another item that coincides is the report of the circle nature of a portion of Atlantis. If you look on the eastern edge, you will see an old crater. If this was above water, it would have given Atlantis its shape.
<|endoftext|>One recommendation I have for people is to really dive into the second volume of H.P. Blavatsky's book ["The Secret Doctrine"](  That's where the foundation of the modern ideas of Lemuria etc. and much on Atlantis come from. There's been a lot of outgrowth of those ideas, some more fantastic than others, since Blavatsky, and not all is compatible with what she wrote.The Secret Doctrine is one hell of a dense read, but worth it if you can stick with it. Volume 2 lays out the theosophical version of the history of humanity and is beyond interesting. Volume 1 lays out the theosophical view of cosmogony. 
<|endoftext|>Humorous prose with some poignant points
<|endoftext|>One of my favorite reads is Adam and Eve from The Urantia Papers. This I believe was the story of Atlantis or the First Garden of Eden that sunk beneath the waters.Here is a snippet.ADAM AND EVE arrived on Urantia, from the year A.D. 1934, 37,848 years ago. It was in midseason when the Garden was in the height of bloom that they arrived. At high noon and unannounced, the two seraphic transports, accompanied by the Jerusem personnel intrusted with the transportation of the biologic uplifters to Urantia, settled slowly to the surface of the revolving planet in the vicinity of the temple of the Universal Father. All the work of rematerializing the bodies of Adam and Eve was carried on within the precincts of this newly created shrine. And from the time of their arrival ten days passed before they were re-created in dual human form for presentation as the worlds new rulers. They regained consciousness simultaneously. The Material Sons and Daughters always serve together. It is the essence of their service at all times and in all places never to be separated. They are designed to work in pairs; seldom do they function alone.
<|endoftext|>I like the theory that 'atlantis' was either in the Mediterranean Sea or the Persian gulf. The Persian gulf is particularly interesting, because the book of Genesis describes Eden as the place where the euphrates and Tigris converge. If you consider that 10-20k years ago the oceans were low enough that the gulf would have been dry, then it would make sense for the first civilization to have started there. Then perhaps there was some rapid melting of ice which quickly raised ocean levels, perhaps even the release of massive lakes held back by ice dams, such as the one that stretched across North America in the Pacific Northwest. The Mediterranean also could have had an ice dams in the strait of Gibraltar that released a tidal wave into the Mediterranean Sea.

<|endoftext|>heres my personal theory. There was once was great civilisation 12000 years ago. There was geological evidence was meteor hitting the ice caps . The caused huge catastrophe . By hitting the ice caps the water leval went up dramatically . that could explain why alot of ancient structures are under water. Then the surviors of the metor spilt apart and made their own sub culture. This could explain why Egyptians and all other empires that related during that time were similar. Same set of gods . A god king a jelous brother that wants the throne etc. Also adds explain why alot pyrmids mad during that time. Dont really have a clue about what caused the collaspe of the bronze age. to be honest .

Highly recommend this series for anyone interested in the subject.Quote from the series "The Pyramid Code is a documentary series of 5 episodes that explores the pyramid fields and ancient temples in Egypt as well as ancient megalithic sites around the world looking for clues to matriarchal consciousness, ancient knowledge and sophisticated technology in a Golden Age."
<|endoftext|>I still think constantly about where we would be if the Library of Alexandria would have never been burned. I feel like there would have been info on all this.
<|endoftext|>Check out the Disc of Sabu, it looks like it could have been part of some kind of ancient machinery[*SCHIST DISC](
<|endoftext|>I remember reading a question in college English about the reasons Shakespeare had for having a mechanical clock chime in Julius Caesar when ancient Rome "obviously didn't have mechanical clocks."When you think about traditional watchmakers, how solitary their work is and how few people it would take to either pass on the knowledge or destroy it completely, it makes you wonder about the quiet corners of humanity where arcane knowledge resides.
<|endoftext|>It's truly amazing. [Clickspring]( is reconstructing it using only ancient methods. It's really fascinating. 
<|endoftext|>Gears =/= computer. I feel this example is very sensationalized. And realizing the relationship between a few gears and time does not a computer make. What am i missing?
<|endoftext|>Debunked 
<|endoftext|>Have you seen... I think it was Nik Research who made the observation that probably a thunderbolt.. from the sun? or from some passing planet scarred our planet from around Nepal to Africa. It sounds pretty mad to begin with, until you watch the testable hypotheses from the Thunderbolts of the Gods (Symbols from an Alien Sky) youtube vid. and take in google maps from a zoomed out point. One can see the proposed arch through the Middle East too, between these points. It's as good as an explanation as any I've heard so far. NASA images of Mars show the same sort of scarring.
<|endoftext|> geography has changed in the time of human civilizationWhat evidence do we have that this is the case?
<|endoftext|>This is ridiculously interesting, thank you for this.I do believe that humans have FAR more history than what we're being told (the ~10k years of human settlements we're fed is a joke). That said, statements like this:During the second high period of civilization solar power, magnetic propulsion, artificially grown crystalline hardware were commonplace....and others where he mentions that we had bases on the moon and explored the inner solar system. I do find this all hard to believe. We have a large amount of proof of the dinosaurs but not a single shred of evidence that any of these societies existed? I want to believe. Hahaha :)
<|endoftext|>On like page 11, and a lot of this makes sense and its scary af. This comment confuses me though: "I dont buy this one, sorry. Your are good though. What would we lose if we knew our past? What would the elite lose if there is no sinister agenda behind? Quoting: MatjazReligious people would be forced to forfeit their beliefs. Archeologists, philosophers and others would be forced to admit their knowledge is insufficient and concerning the history they know as little as a common person.Reverse engineering the renewable energy sources would deprive vast companies of their income, cheap and effective medical technologies would undermine the medical complex and so on.The change of this magnitude is too much for a great many people."The people who would lose the most, would be those who are more accustomed toward enslavement being a practice/norm, the elites who require peons to even provide them things to spend their money on. He speaks of a great war between a "slave loving" society/civilization vs a "we are all equal" society/civilization a few pages before, I believe its simple to realize those who wanted to enslave, won. EDIT: I like one thing: "Were you able to find out what the other side is like? Should we have no worries or do everything we can to stay alive? Quoting: Anonymous Coward 65480503Also were they able to create artificial intelligence? Quoting: Anonymous Coward 65480503Bump Quoting: Anonymous Coward 65480503Yes, learning machines with some form of self awareness did exist."Seems someone created an A.I, seems like shit went down the drain after that....EDIT: "We never bothered with Roswell."K. re-occurring theme is the movement verbally, and subliminally, away from anything extra-terrestrial or extra-dimensional, we know the jinn exist, they are just another type of electromagnetic being like us, but existing in a different state then we do. This is odd, either fear, due to seeing something or finding something out unsettling, or being told to simply not discuss it for a reason. Very awkward. He COULD have said Roswell was just a USA proto-type, but instead steered RIGHT away from it, specific...FINAL EDIT: I believe this to be a psy-op of some type. This person has edited and removed comments, and has stated several times he doesn't have knowledge on a specific topic, and 15-25 pages later, is talking about it. They also state there are no aliens, and then later state that there are aliens but didn't interfere with past civilizations.Something about all of this smells fishy. He won't touch on anything metaphysical, within a post that is sourced through a metaphysical means, FISHIER THAN r/cutefish. 
<|endoftext|>Oh my gosh thanks for the share! I wish he talk about spiritual things though. He said he doesn't comment on spiritual questions. 
<|endoftext|>I noticed Alterwelt talked about the Voynich Manuscript:"Re: Remote Viewing Ancient Civilizations - a compilation of data.What is the voynich manuscript and what language was used in it? What was its purpose and who created it? Quoting: Anonymous Coward 56184035 It's not written in a language, its written in a cypher using a dead language. It was a message from one representative of a secret society to his colleagues. It's not meant for the casual reader."According to this article it has been decoded-  So maybe it's all just really well-worded bullshit? I don't know. I read a bunch of these pages and their answers seem plausible, but this one is just bugging me. I mean, maybe his answer isn't wrong, just conveniently worded?
<|endoftext|>This is fascinating, thank you for sharing! It also fits in really well with the research on Atlantis by Lewis Spence and Robert Stacy-Judd, seeming to confirm many of their hypotheses about waves of Atlantean colonists to the Americas.
<|endoftext|> The first structures were built over 32.000 years ago by the colonists from the atlantic landmasses.How do they arrive at these dates and ages?
<|endoftext|>Unless I am mistaken, someone was browsing /x/ recently ;) That's how I found that thread, I didn't get to finish it but damn that was an interesting read.I honestly think a lot of what the guy says COULD be right, a lot of it fits - and he seemed to have a really deep knowledge of many subjects - and was honest when confronted with things he did not remote view (ie: Excalibur).
<|endoftext|> So this guy started a thread on Godlike Productions' forum saying he can remote view ancient civilizations.What is "remote viewing"? And how can it be used to examine civilizations from the past? It sounds like you're describing telepathic time-travel.
<|endoftext|> After reading this I was amazed it wasn't common knowledge given all the evidence in favour of it.Maybe there's a reason it's not common knowledge. Denying the Ice Age theory is a pretty huge claim. How have other scientists responded to it? Links would be ideal.Also, could you link some bios of those authors? I wasn't able to find a source for them being professors. Couldn't find where they got their PhDs or where they had their appointments.

<|endoftext|>Sandy Islands are very common old school map making stuff.Map makers would add things in that were fake, when it reapered in another map they would know it was copied.No one does this now, maps are not rare or valuable today. But I could see some stuff getting left in for a few generations of maps until someone figured it out 
<|endoftext|>i remember the land mass near Australia, but our location in the milky way changing is still the change that blows my mind more than any other..besides maybe fruit of the loom not having a cornicopia
<|endoftext|>Stories passed down through generations I suspect. Much like the stories in the bible were passed down for 600 years before they were written up.
<|endoftext|>I like this rabbit hole. The only thing keeping me from it is that such star would have been detected by its gravitational influence in the solar system. Objects as small as Pluto were derived/predicted from such gravitational irregularities using Newton's mechanics. Einstein's general relativity is even more precise.  The only way for such a black star to exist is if it is not a normal black star but an intelligent custom built one made by advanced extraterrestrial beings who possess mastery over gravity and matter. 
<|endoftext|>article on cuba:
<|endoftext|>Is there any evidence that these 1-4 root races ever existed or is it just material for fiction book?
<|endoftext|>Makes you wonder if there were civilizations which navigated the globe long before Europeans did.Possible as Jpmon out of southern Okinawa/Taiwan.and southern Japan region sailed to Western Chile region 4000 plus y ears ago,, and Polynesians form Lapita culture sailed throughout the Pacific as well. Alos Ainu out of Northern Japan and Siberia sailed along the Ice Shelf fir the Ice age around the edge, and followed to America. link. I need more time to watch. BTW the Omani at the end of the Arabian peninsula along the Indian ocean. Also had an empire that ranged from Southern Africa along uo the east coast to Ethiopia all the way to India and on to China as well for the spice trade. This started 1000 years BCE. They then stored the spices like Frankincense and Myrrh and other spices and traveled along the Frankincense trail to Egypt and Palestine to trade
<|endoftext|>Everything's possible. To my mind it'd probably not be as old as wiki states. You see things like the half-built temples in the rock face in Lycia and just think, Fuck man, what the hell happened. This stuff existed alright, but how old it is and who built it and how can we get that excellent clean tech back is a more important question imho.
<|endoftext|>The technology is on par with AD 1300s technology despite being as old as 200 BC. How was that technology lost and why did it take a thousand years before we got back to that level of advancement?Analog computer used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendar and astrological purposes decades in advance
<|endoftext|>Electronic Computers =/= Only kind of ComputerThe gears are designed in such a way that they can follow celestial bodies and predict astronomical events like eclipses. Basically the design of the gears and how they interacted was the software and the hardware. It has 1 set of built in inputs to start the computation. The movement of the gears is the actually computing part and the resulting visuals from the gear movement signaled different outputs. Input, computation, output = Basic Computer
<|endoftext|>Actually what we know as a computer would be an electronic computing device. Anything that does computations is called a computer. An abacus is still a calculator, but when we think of calculators we think of electronic ones. I understand where youre coming from though 
<|endoftext|>Compute = computerCompute the lights in the sky = computer?Modern computers are faster and more dynamically defined (programs). But the general concept of automating computation is clearly seen in this mechanism (one program)
<|endoftext|>a computer is a mechanism that does computing... whats there to miss this device was used to compute thus a computer.
<|endoftext|>It's not just gears though, the gears maintain several different states, so it has sort of a "memory" much like a calculator or computer. Early computers were analog and worked like this too, I'm thinking of punchcards.
<|endoftext|>Update the wikipedia article please.EDIT: Also explain where anything I personally commented about this was debunked.
<|endoftext|> Our ancient ancestors are the same as modern humans.From your article. This statement is so patently false that it entirely throws the rest of their conclusions out the window. 
<|endoftext|>Now connect planetary size electric arcs with a conspiracy to add a few hundred years to our calendar.
<|endoftext|>Is that in the area between the British Isles and Europe? Whenever I talk with my mother about ancient civilizations she brings up Doggerland.I've heard saying that most people make settlements along coastlines, and i've also heard that a few thousand years ago the sea level may have been up to 400m lower than today, which I think would leave many of todays seaside towns high and dry
<|endoftext|> What evidence do we have that this is the case?The massive sea level rise that happened at the end of the ice age covered up massive amounts of land.
<|endoftext|>I am in the same boat as you here. I believe human history travels further back than has been told in history books but sometimes people take it too far.It's why I love listening to Graham Hancock, good realistic ideas
<|endoftext|>When I stumbled across that post it was like the first time I ever saw the website. I even got a couple questions in to the OP (Alterwelt) before he disappeared.The whole thing is freaking crazy, and I love it. He's very convincing, and the answers he gives seem plausible most of the time. It's my personal opinion that if high technology existed during these "high periods of civilization" I wouldn't be surprised to find that evidence has been eradicated from the face of the earth due to time. If so much of the earths population lives so close to the coastlines now, imagine what would happen if we were hit with a cataclysmic flood. [Here is a cool video showing the earth if all the ice melted.]( That would raise the sea levels by 216 feet. Many of our most populated areas would be underwater. Florida would essentially be completely underwater.Makes you wonder what kind of historical record we would leave behind if we went through a cataclysm similar to the one Alterwelt or Graham Hancock talk about.
<|endoftext|>Bro, dinosaurs were a plant from the winners/survivors of the ancient world's previous golden era. Cmon, the 'illuminati' of the ancient past could have created some NWO type of deal. Starting bioengineering bones and using some cern type stuff to speed up decay. Then creating an 'ice age' using climate control, and controlling the only fertile land in the world. Then creating a testament to the new world. These days those kind of technologies seem to be obtainable in only decades. Maybe somewhere out there the true history of the world exists, I bet it's interesting.
<|endoftext|>Have you ever heard the theory of humans being from mars / a planet that was destroyed and is now the asteroid belt? Supposedly our biological clock in space is exactly the same clockwise as being on or around mars orbit 
<|endoftext|>Well this theory relies on the government or TPTB or whoever trying to hide this from us. He said on I think page 4 that there are many artifacts at the Smithsonian. Only thing is why go so out if your way to hide that these civilizations existed?
<|endoftext|> I do believe that humans have FAR more history than what we're being told (the ~10k years of human settlements we're fed is a joke).That sounds really interesting. Why do you say that? Could you share some sources?
<|endoftext|>I disagree with your post and heres why:These billion dollar companies could pivot if this technology was available to be reversed engineered in no fucking time. The medical companies dont want it known because it would reduce their income? Fuck no. They would be selling these crystals or whatever at vast amounts of money in a second. Unlimited energy? The oil companies would pivot and get cheap, renewable energy to be resold in another second.For real. Theres tons of money to made if its true and reversible. The new found tech would make it easier to make a slave society, not harder. Think of the weapons, the control, the power and shit they could build with this new tech.Thats why I dont think this is real. Because someone would be greedy and using it already.
<|endoftext|>I agree with your post. I noticed that the answerer unconvincingly pivoted from a question about crop circles as well. I wonder if the answerer and his team are either purposeful disinformation agents (likely), or they are a team of powerful viewers and they have certain walls, veils, or limitations that they can't (or won't) see through. Have you heard any scuttlebut that Godlike Productions is a CIA honeypot or something? I've stumbled upon that notion once or twice but I don't have a link or source for that. 
<|endoftext|>To be fair about the aliens part..I literally only read page one, where he says all of our civilization has been terrestrial alone.But he doesn't say aliens DON'T exist.I haven't read further to what else he says about them, so it's quite possible he does contradict that very specific claim above. 
<|endoftext|>I believe he does answer some questions as to religious figures as actual people somewhere among the threads.
<|endoftext|>No it was ancient Turkish. Someone actually cracked it. 
<|endoftext|>I've never heard of /x/, but I personally came across Alterwelt completely by accident when I was browsing godlike productions several years ago. I haven't been able to get it out of my head ever since and felt this thread was a perfect place to share it. 
<|endoftext|>Hundreds of references to academic papers per chapter, it's almost overwhelming. It's written by two teachers so they've done their homework. 
<|endoftext|>While I'm still not sure I buy the whole root races thing, various groups seem to think something important will be happening in 2025.What I find interesting is that 2025 will briefly at the beginning of the year be 1776 in the Julian (Roman) calendar by the reckoning of Phantom Time Hypothesis. 1776 is printed on the US $1 bill, supposedly as a representation of the founding year of the US, but it is peculiarly written in Roman numerals without the month or day, next to two Latin phrases, potentially signaling that it instead refers to J.1776. Further, one of these phrases is generally translated as "a new order for the ages", or sometimes as "a new world order", but it can also be translated as "a new class of races".
<|endoftext|>Thank you very much, this is awesome information! Just digging into it. Have a lot of respect for the Theosophists, so this is a great source!
<|endoftext|>I worded my comment vaguely thinking I would get told to elaborate or get criticized, but thank you for elaborating for me
<|endoftext|>Are you referring to the self sustaining atomic reactor? thats a hot one... getit... radioactive... its a prehistory dad joke. 
<|endoftext|>I think that due to its large orbit and far distance from our inner solar system, it would be very hard to detect until it gets much closer....I dont know how far away it might currently be but I do have reasons to think that sometime in the next few years it will be back. I have tied a number of conspiracy theories together with this being a huge factor. Think about how the Mayan calendar ended just a few years ago....it would make sense that their calculations would be off a bit....a small error would account for a few years on that kind of scale.
<|endoftext|>Yeah thats what I used to think but now it makes much more sense to think that there is a black star out there. There is a tattoo that some gang member have on their hand of a black star. I think that might tie into this shit too....just another little piece of info. I honestly have seen enough to be convinced of my theory....pop culture references veiled in allegory all over the place too.
<|endoftext|>Actually, aztecs aren't even a real people that's just what indigenous ppl of Mexico are called. What's referred to when people say "Aztecs" are really the one tribe that had ruled and intimidated all the other tribes.And pyramids don't come to mind? Bro nothing is common? along and see the pictures
<|endoftext|>That was my first time back in forever. I remembered that's where I learned about the Baigong Pipes and figured it doubled as a walk down memory lane. 
<|endoftext|>Depends on what you think the relation might be between the various species in the family Hominidae and the genus Homo, and what theosophy calls Root-Races and sub-races. Clearly there have been several major stages in the development of "Man" as we know it, and all a "race" means in theosophy is a "stage of development". But anyway, as Graham Hancock says, we're a species with amnesia. We seem to know next to nothing about our actual history and what was going on during the millions of years of big brained homo species. Perhaps major cataclysms are why we have so little knowledge or evidence. 
<|endoftext|>I couldn't stake a yae or nae to that claim, but I don't know shit about Sumerian civilization.. and I think only a single disc has been *disc*overed
<|endoftext|>The lost chronology theory could be applied to that. Some think the church invented a few hundred years of history to make the bible work. 
<|endoftext|>I believe that this could be proof for the theory that the history as we know it has been severly tampered with, that 1000-some years were added, now known as the "dark ages" [here is a redditor's theory on it](
<|endoftext|>The introduction of Christianity and Islam, along with the dark ages can be attributed to that. Thanks religion.
<|endoftext|>The Roman Empire was incredibly sophisticated. Technology being on par with the 1300ADs is very vague when people were build aquifers, mixing and making concrete, etc thousands of years ago. We still dont know all of the tech and knowledge lost when the empire collapsed. But that doesnt mean its a computer just because it resembles something like todays.
<|endoftext|>Thats not true. Steam powered devices and gear driven mechanisms date back to 2600 bc. Meaning... the technology is on par with the time. Please google the south pointing chariot. I again ask... we do not consider gear diven time pieces to be computers, and i feel this is highly sensationalized. What am i missing? 
<|endoftext|>I have always had the feeling that humanity is the old timey tech and that when we engineer our upgrade, via nowadays computers, we then will become obsolete.Or some such...Only an unsubstantiated idea.
<|endoftext|>Please explain how manual gears predict astrological events? Not just here i mean in general? Id really like to know... the person designing gear ratios did the computing, which is very basic mariner-centric time piece. But go on... how do manual gears compute anything? You know someone turns them right? Youre an idiot, the only time you see someone say predicting astrological events on this subject.. is sensationalized youtube and conspiracy pandering content. Actual peer reviewed pub lishings cant even confirm it was a time piece with all the missing hypothetical pieces. Reality is partial housing and pieces from 2 gears do not make a computer, and do not make a magical set of gears that predicted eclipses... im done in this thread. Please add .edu and stop trying to google stuff to reafffirm your notions, learn something...
<|endoftext|>No thats what youtube says. Peer reviewed studys say it is very open for interpretation hut is a celestial calendar... didnt predict anything, just mariner centric timepiece. Kool aid...
<|endoftext|>No... just no. This thread is full of claims that only show up in sensationalized youtube vids. Please consider adding .edu when researching this. If were calling time pieces computers, sun dials were the first computers? This still isnt close within a thousand years of first gear driven time piece... The fact is this is pieces of 2 gears people profoundly hypothesize upon, when all peer reviewed data dates the item over a thousand years after gear driven time pieces, hydraulics and even steam powered devices and note that 'predicting astralogical events' is horseshit hearsay. This community is beyond toxic when you disagree with kool aid. Fact is this was likely used to measure time via/astralogical clock, seems more complex to modern humans because we dont know or use the stars to tell us time and location like more mariner-centric people did... and yes, its still amazing. But not omg lost civilization predicting astrological events amazing... thats horse shit.
<|endoftext|>Read all the posts... or dont. Its already been shown gears and housing alone do not possess computing ability, no interaction, easy. I went round about way of making guy arguing contradict himself. This is silly. Edit: op even edited his post...
<|endoftext|>They create a device that can *compute* calculations through a a replicatable pattern?Let me dumb it down: "a device created by humans to predict events normally done on a pad and paper or the current and local equivalent". Way to shoot yourself in the foot."Computation" doesn't mean binary and electronics.
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the link:It wasnt just found though. The comments contain links to Mexican authorities who have been aware of the structure since the 1700s when it was abandoned due to the plague with discussions of it as recently as the 60s.
<|endoftext|>These fucking jokes aren't even funny. Especially when real questions are asked. It just distracts from the conversation and people don't want to share and talk about what they were about to. Because instead of thought and discussion, it will be met with pointless memes.I was actually curious what he thought was under the sand, but I bet I won't find out what he was thinking now. Sweet meme though bro!Downvote me though, go ahead. Prove /r/conspiracy is filled with 14 year olds posting shit jokes for karma coming from /r/prequelmemes. Pathetic really
<|endoftext|>there are some pretty big structures under water in japan. clearly there was some big cities that are no longer with us. what I find crazy is that there are not any records of them. no cultures are like oh year we used to live in massive city X but it started getting underwater and so we moved it uphill a bit. 
<|endoftext|>Yeah and it covers even larger going out into the Atlantic and then above northern Europe were also above sea level.Maybe the island of Hy Brasil could be a final remnant of it. I also think it could be one way to try and explain the Baltic sea anomaly could explain a land civilization from around there at another date. Still absolutely no idea of its true purpose if it was made by a civilization there though.Edit: couple words
<|endoftext|>I feel it's a good place to start - let's make our theory of ancient civilizations about humans - so that we KNOW it's possible, otherwise we all look like idiots...I mean, once the groundwork for the real history has been laid, if aliens show up or artifacts are found etc - then shit, okay, we can update again - better to start at the bottom and build up - rather than jump off the cliff screaming "twas aliuns!"
<|endoftext|> I believe human history travels further back than has been told in history booksWhy do you believe this?Are you open the possibility that in fact the opposite is the case?That is, are you willing to consider the possibility that human history is in fact only a few hundred years old?
<|endoftext|>Theres a joe rogan podcast with graham taking about the water levels before the last ice age and how the sea level is much lower then it is today. So it got me thinking wouldnt they be able to map out the old coastlines of these ancient cities? Maybe they do and keep it from the public or simply the ocean is just to big to effectively search its depths. 
<|endoftext|>Over the course of the past few days, little by little, I've gone through all 286 pages (skipping through to Alerwelt's replies).Buddhism got many things wrong. Jesus got all of them right.They go on and on about Jesus. Saying that he was genetically just a man, but he came to understand all of creation. OP elsewhere mentions that modern man isn't capable of understanding all of creation because our modern brains can't handle it.They also mention that:--Bigfoot creatures can teleport a few miles at a time. --We used to be able to go to the moon in four hours, Mars in two months, and had colonies in orbit.--Black people are an evolution of another, extremely similar homo species.--People during the first period of civilization didn't dream as they had access to the dreamscape at any time and basically walked around in a half dream state.--During the time of man, North America had a bird with a nearly 100' wing span (keeping in mind the largest we know of was closer to 25', with the largest pterodactyl at about 35').It got more and more ridiculous as it went on but *boy* was it all entertaining, I have to give them that. Also, whoever is behind it seems to be very well educated. They speak enough proven 'truth' that it's easy to go along with them for the ride.What questions did you ask? I truly wish I'd been there, I have a few of my own I'd love to ask! If even ten percent of what OP said was true, then it's still completely earth shattering info. Again, it's more fun to believe than to just flat out refuse to even entertain any of it. 
<|endoftext|>Because it rewrites human history. Religions would be uprooted, new tech would be available that would collapse the energy sector, and a big portion of academics would have to admit the lack of knowledge. How do you think people would react if it came out that previous humans existed, were space fairers, and had tech beyond our imagination? 
<|endoftext|> The medical companies dont want it known because it would reduce their income? Fuck no. They would be selling these crystals or whatever at vast amounts of money in a second.Not if it cured diseases. Medical companies have no interest in curing anything. Their entire business model is built around treatment, not curing. If you cure someone you lose a customer.
<|endoftext|>Their power comes from them having access to this tech while the rest of us stay happy with our outdated tech that they still get rich from.
<|endoftext|>Have you heard any scuttlebut that Godlike Productions is a CIA honeypot or something?Your giving the CIA too much credit.Corruption, Treason, Black operations involving machinery far more advanced than we currently perceive, data collection, mechanisms of control like media, sports, and music, etc.They aren't running fake websites, they are busy doing something much more illegal and profitable. 
<|endoftext|>Ya figures as historical figures, but when aboit the spirit realm of deities he says he won't answer those questions. I just find it odd. He must of seen something he just doesn't want to divulge. 
<|endoftext|>Neat! X/ is the Paranormal chan forum, which I normally don't waste my time on - but I found that gem there last night...Life's fucked like that... a lot of what Alterwelt said really clicked for me, especially with Ancient America. - so yeah, great post, universe must have some kind of use for the info in there :D
<|endoftext|>The races are literally different. Physiologically, psychologically, culturally, etc.Pointing out that those differences come with advantages and disadvantages is going to be absolutely necessary if we as humans ever want to create an equal society.Every time someone uses the word "racist" as an insult, they do damage to our future by creating a social stigma around incredibly important topics.We *need* to look at things with logic if we are to grow.
<|endoftext|>I've found a lot of the pre human history stuff interesting, I did get a book about the Akunani (spelling?) But as I read it it just came to me that this guy was talking out of his ass a lot of the time lol but interesting stuff.I'll look at your links when I get some time later todayThanks
<|endoftext|>That author (Charles Johnston) wrote a tonne of interesting articles. See [here]( 
<|endoftext|>I don't think you theory is far fetched at all, was just wondering if it could have a similar affect.I like your theory.
<|endoftext|>Many cultures built pyramids. That doesnt mean they had ties to Egypt or they share something in common. The pyramids are very different in design, function and how they were built. Their languages are not similar nor dress nor funeral rights nor clothing nor genetics. They just dont have anything that shows a common lineage or cultural migration. 
<|endoftext|>I believe there's more than one, I watched a video tour of the museum they recently opened to the public 
<|endoftext|>The Dark Ages is actually pretty well known and isnt lacking in sources like was originally thought when the term was coined in the 1330s. A freshman history student understands this...Your thought that nothing occurred then is still the lay persons thought but its far from the truth.
<|endoftext|>check out "the spectral time hypothesis" by some german dude. With his theory right now we have ~1730
<|endoftext|>This has nothing to do with aquifers or concrete, those are completely different technologies that have nothing to do with the discusson at hand, so what's your point? That's like saying self driving cars aren't 21st century technology because people had boats thousands of years ago; it makes zero sense because the two aren't related.I also don't understand what you could possibly find vague about 1300s technology; we're discussing one, single piece of technology, not 1300s technology in general. The specific technology in question is the ability to manufacture a device capable of predicting astronomical events decades in advance(also tracking calendar, 4 year olympics cycle, irregular orbit of the moon, etc) without the need to do the math by hand, which other than the device is not seen until the 1300s.I also think you're confused about what the term computer means in a non-modern context since you keep insisting that a bunch of gears isn't necessarily a computer, even though we know exactly what function it was built for (COMPUTING predictive astronomical problems). The device was used to solve (compute) predictive astronomical problems without needing to do the math by hand. What about the device doesn't seem like a computer to you? analogue computeris a form ofcomputerthat uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such aselectrical,**mechanical** *^(gears in this case)*, orhydraulicquantities tomodelthe **problem being solved** *^(predictions of astronomical events decades in advance)*.
<|endoftext|> the technology is on par with the timeWait a moment. I agree that there's nothing suspicious here. But what is usually reported is that \*before\* the Antikythera mechanism was found there was nothing remotely similar to its complexity, and nothing remotely similar to the degree of precision and craftemenship required to build it. If it hadn't been dated precisely it surely would have been considered an hoax. But now we know we had the skills to build something like this long ago, case closed. I don't see any mystery myself but to deny the sheer magnitude of this finding is useless.
<|endoftext|>That doesn't even come close to the complexity of the Antikythera mechanism. Meaning... the technology is on par with the time.That was sort of the point. The mechanical complexity predates what is traditionally thought of on par with devices from the 1300's, but stands as an example that it predates that period by about 13-15 hundreds years.
<|endoftext|>Lolol, you're way too butthurt over this thread bruh. By your logic a modern computer isn't a computer because humans designed it. Also, it doesn't matter thats its manually powered: If I power my computer with a stationary bike it is still a computer. 
<|endoftext|> Please explain how manual gears predict astrological events? mean "*astronomical* events', right?
<|endoftext|>Lol. The very act of trying to follow the movements of celestial bodies, which would include positioning that would cause eclipses, is a prediction. Prediction is another word for attempting to guess the future. When the weatherman says on Tuesday that it'll rain Thursday he is making a prediction. When you say the planets will be in this alignment tomorrow night that is a prediction. If you still disagree, you can forget the semantics of prediction and just realize it is computing the movements. The astronomical knowledge inputted wasn't new. The calculations weren't new. But this tool designed to do the calculations using those inputs was new and is an early, simple example of an analog computing device aka a computer. 
<|endoftext|>no one has ever said anything about Youtube. also his argument is less about the gizmo in question and more about your ignorance as to what a computer actually is. 
<|endoftext|>I have never thought about what's beneath the sand. There could be a whole civilization. Imagine the artifacts and history underneath our feet 
<|endoftext|>LAcumDodgers to the rescue.All jokes aside, this is something I had not pondered before, but is perfect speculation to present to someone if you want to keep them thinking. Awesome question.
<|endoftext|>This comment was fantastic in that you ended up distracting from the original conversation more than a stupid fucking joke, as that was what it was, just a stupid joke mate. Anyhow in a way it was good because it seemed to have spawned some decent discusion on the nature of memes. Cheers to that.
<|endoftext|> there are some pretty big structures under water in japan. clearly there was some big cities that are no longer with us.Do you have some links? I'd love to learn more about ancient underwater Japanese cities.
<|endoftext|>Plenty of cultures have those stories, those are the great flood mythologies. Noah and the dozens of other legends from all around the world. Problem is writing was not a thing so thousands of years of telephone turned "sea levels rose wiped out our city" into "BUILD AN ARK 40 CUBITS!"
<|endoftext|>Nope, not at all, carbon dating is pretty rock soild "pun intended" science. There are also a ton of other chemcial dating techniqes. light speed is also a soildly understood science so we understand how old the universe can be. There is absolutely zero chance of human history being 6000 years old or whatever creationism believes. There is a chance we find older remains, we have found some rather interesting ones lately as well as ruins that predate current models of human history. 
<|endoftext|>I've always thought about that. I looked it up last night and found that the ocean has risen 120 meters since the last ice age. I can't link from my phone right now, but I found a map after googling something like "ocean 120 meters lower" and it brought up an old Reddit post with a map of the earth minus 120 meters of ocean. I focused on the area around northern Australia/Indonesia/New Guinea. If you take a look at that map, Australia is connected to New Guinea 12,800 years ago. The sea of Arafura was above sea level. There was a huge land mass from southeast Asia which almost connected to the mainland of Australia. Today it is a string of islands and countries from Malaysia to Indonesia.I theorize that there was an advanced civilization which built the massive pyramid currently being excavated at Gunung Padang in Indonesia. What are now island countries were the mountainous highlands of that time, while all the coastal habitations are now under 120 meters of water west of Sumatra and north of Indonesia. EDIT: [Here is the map of the earth with sea levels 120 meters lower](
<|endoftext|>I think if anything it's more along the lines of TPTB staying in power. No way they can lose their power when they have technology we cant even begin to understand. If we make it far enough, some day people are gonna look back on the government hiding this issue like we look at Galeileo getting imprisoned for saying the earth revolves around the sun.
<|endoftext|>I'm not a cynical about the medical industry, but you are mostly right.If it was some sort of crystal you'd need to constantly rebuy, sure!But what if you just rub it once and bye bye Alzheimer's? There's literally no direct profit there except maybe a one time rubbing fee. 
<|endoftext|>I am inclined to disagree on this one. There are a lotta cubicle farms in Langely. I'm absolutely certain that the CIA does not deem such an initiative below its purview. It seems to me that the CIA has and continues to dabble in its fair share of either bankrolling or outright creating propaganda, social engineering initiatives, and limited hangouts not only on its own citizens, but throughout the planet.Hypothetically, were I in charge of the most disgusting organized crime syndicate on the planet, I'd be more than happy to scrap together a purposefully low-gloss "authentic" hang-out and/or forum targeting curious awakening souls in order to:1. Monitor what awakening people say or are curious about.2. Control the dribble of juicy details about real elements of the consciousness hologram we're all logged into, or at the very least contextualize them in a way that maintains the CIA's control or perch.3. Keep curious yet powerful minds occupied so that the organization's rape and pillage of the planet and its surface population could continue in perpetuity.
<|endoftext|>From what I've heard, it's run by tavistock. Not to mention my phone didn't want me to spell that and if you say it on GLP, you get instantly banned.
<|endoftext|>He says Jesus was as close to God as he said he was, but he was the "transcended" and knew what the higher civilizations knew. It also said Jesus was against organized religion. The OP talks about other spiritual figures like Buddha who knew the same things, just not to the same degree as Jesus.He says consciousness is real and never really ends. As opposed to the previous humans, we made life and death finite and our subconscious is our dream state. He said we can't comprehend what the higher humans thought or operated like because their brains were always subconsciously awake and similar to a lucid dream state. Some far out shit
<|endoftext|>I started a new post to keep everything organized. It includes all three Alterwelt threads, as well as another GLP thread from someone that seems to be Alterwelt, or someone from his group.
<|endoftext|>It's definitely readable, not as dry as some other works by academics can be. If your interested in the topic you'll melt through the book. 
<|endoftext|> you go. Cambridge educated, science historian and teacher for years. That credible enough for you? While I understand your perspective, if you're waiting for a professor from a modern university to argue against the established history narrative you're going to be waiting a long time. 
<|endoftext|>Yes! I strongly wish more people understood this. Society seems to be stuck in an older framework of understanding the races, where too much is considered taboo and real discussion can't occur when most people are either overly sensitive or worried about offending someone. There is no way truly forward from this point, only more of the same, just like the powers that be want it. They love to see us divided and hating each other.. it keeps us from focusing our discontent where it really belongs. If we could all come together, unite our visions and find true strength in numbers and new purpose, we would be unstoppable. 
<|endoftext|>No idea. Though the idea that life began at the poles does make a certain amount of sense to me.Tbh I'd say anyone claiming they can *prove* or *know* much of anything about humanity prior to about 12,000 years ago is likely far over reaching. It's a sad state of affairs that we know so little, but we can speculate and try to put puzzle pieces together. May be that we'll never know for sure. 
<|endoftext|>A friend just randomly shared [this]( with me, so thought I'd pass it on. It's a scientific paper examining the question of if and how we might discover evidence of industrial civilizations on Earth in our remote past. And here's a [summary "layman's" article]( about it.
<|endoftext|>Yep we have sources for many things in that time period and the world politics of the time usually align with why you would have increase or decrease of sources or literacy. This theory is definitely going a bit far. However some scientific papers on the solar patters and time scale would be interesting to read, but the link I followed had nothing and the thread did not have any legitimate sources or studies.  \_()_/ 
<|endoftext|>Please google the south pointing chariot... it predates it by a minimim of 1200 yrs and does the same thing... well, does more Edit: and as ive said steam and gear driven timepieces and even hydraulic were around for a millennia before this. Im done in this topic tho, too deep, no interest in arguing with people citing youtube vids... beyond stupidEdit as well: changrd facing to pointing. My bad
<|endoftext|>Okay weve reached a dead end i guess. Ty for your effort. For the record... it is incredibly more complex, it tracked time, direction as well as distance, i guess... time is tougher, especially 1400 (2600 by your estimate) years later?... not according to the youtube hysteria around this object. I sware youtube conspiracy videos are a conspiracy to discredit conspiracys... so much kool aid.
<|endoftext|>No, just disappointed, very disappointed in modern skeptics on reddit (/conspiracy) self destruct logic. I.e. a lot of people here, say i argue 1/8 based on representation of responses actually looked up this object with an emphasis on peer reviewed data, it is important not only what but where scientific/historical claims are made. If i say something, and have even the ability to censor discourse, i should be taken less seriously than if i say something encouraging others to disagree, tear down a statement and together build a better one... so ALL peer reviewed data on this object says a few things, and everyone (7/8) is apparently disagreeing with their findings. And that is disappointing, and not really worth the time after a point (which ive passed idk why im here... day off maybe to blamd, i should go buy a wii u and mario maker 1.5 yrs late, lol). Anyways... this then gets into the territory of not understanding how gears work. Otherwise youd have acknowledged by this logic a wheel with a marker on it is a computer. The source of power isnt the point, the point is because it is a time device the start time affects ability for a set of gears (just think bicycle with mark om wheel). If you can find all the missing pieces, and then run a few trials where you predict an astrological event despite start time, ill concede. Until then, this is silly. Take care friend. :)
<|endoftext|>They made claims earlier in thread about predicting astrological events. Thats root of my kool aid youtube nonsense... as thats only place its found. Maybe there is also some confusion around the device in their minds capabilities vs the device actual known capabilities... which for the last fucking time is theorized to be an astrological/celestial timepiece... which means it isnt computing anything. If you think it predicts astrological events... then to you its a computer. Of youre going off peer reviewed actual data on the damn thing, its not computing anything, the builder did the computing with gear ratios... im so done in this thread though. Take care. Believe whatever the fuck you want. 
<|endoftext|>that is pretty cool. I saw this thing on the discovery channel when I was a kid about some desert shrubs in Africa that can go a long time without water and then there was a dust storm that buried one of these shrubs under like 120foot sand dune in a day or two. if that much sand can dune up on a friggin shrub then the terrain can change dramatically in a few generations. if I remember correctly didn't they have to excavate some of the pyramids because they were literally buried in sand? who knows what else in under all that sand. 
<|endoftext|>Something similar happened in Bulgaria, East Europe.They have a town called Nessebar, that was sacked by the Turks and was a focal point of many wars between Bulgaria and Turkey.This town is split into old and new Nessebar but they inhabit the same 'island'. I can't remember what the proper term is, but it's one of those towns that is (well, was, they built a higher road a few years ago) only accessible when the tide is out.A few years ago they were doing some renovation in the town centre when they uncovered ancient roman ruins(or ruins of the same time period) When you walk through the town, the tops of the ruins are only a few feet below street level and they have uncovered some amazing architecture.So, I suppose it goes to show that ruins could be lost through various wars or just buried totally for whatever random reason shit ends up below the ground. More importantly, it shows that even in a busy town with a long history, secrets remain hidden just under the surface.Who knows what we would find in mid Africa or Greece or Italy or...
<|endoftext|>Haha. Yes, they do detract when they are solely about being a pointless silly meme joke and that's all they add. And don't you worry bud, I *do* seek out information. Thanks for assuming. I already have researched the topic at hand. I wanted to hear his thoughts. Unfortunately, for people who haven't, they get 0 information at all. Convo over. These shit memes just stop the conversation, instead of promote it. That's why this is frustrating. I know I will research this topic more, but shitty memes will probably discourage some others from looking into the topic. Kind of the opposite view of /r/conspiracy, no? Fuck me for wanting people to actually discuss things at hand instead of switching the conversation to flavor of the hour level bullshit?But yeah, defend the shit joke and subreddit, and pretend like those low effort garbage memes from /r/prequelmemes don't stop and limit conversation. But thanks for showing that you would rather stand up for a fad joke subreddit...really shows your character. Or lack thereof
<|endoftext|>There are a few websites that talk about them the wiki page I think calls it a geological formation but [one look]( and its clear they are not naturally formed.
<|endoftext|> There is absolutely zero chance of human history being 6000 years old or whatever creationism believes. Just going for 'Devils advocate here' (Because I am bored and at work and always interested in others minds) (NOTE: I am NOT a creationist):Regarding that comment, often carbon dating and the dating of the rock around it are used as proof against creationism, however... wouldnt an all powerful being be able to fake those results? place them in an already deteriorated state? Like how they believe the dino bones were put there by lucifer to test our faith (or whatever)
<|endoftext|> carbon dating is pretty rock soild "pun intended" scienceWhat leads you to believe this? light speed is also a soildly understood science so we understand how old the universe can be. What does 'light speed' have to do with anything? There is absolutely zero chance of human history being 6000 years old or whatever creationism believes. Who said anything about 'creationism'? What does that even mean?
<|endoftext|>Yeah so basically Oceania would be one big continent. I was reading something about the coral reefs and how there finding massive reefs at depths of up to 1500ft but coral reefs are only formed around 150ft so it proves the ocean floors go up and down which could be an explanation for Atlantis and Lemuria disappearing in stages. So in other words they think these lost cities are under the coral reefs and that explains why we havnt found anything because the reefs are a protected ecosystem. 
<|endoftext|>It just lends to credibility. People who have in depth research that would be Earth shattering if true, tend to be close to a doctorate. 
<|endoftext|>- I'm not the persone you were talking to.- It actually says the first documented south-pointing chariot was built 500 hundreds after the Antikythera mechanism.- It's just a chariot with two differential gears, not a tool the size of a book with 80 gears, and it has been built by carpenters for centuries, while tools that required the craftmanship of the Antikythera mechanism couldn't be built until 1400 CE. So I don't know what you are talking about, if you believe the Antikythera mechanism is anything less than an extraordinary finding I won't even try to convince you.
<|endoftext|>Please update the wiki article then with sources that confirms your stance about it being unremarkable and an average work for the period and I will stop sharing it. I have never seen a youtube video about this thing actually, I found it linked in a lame list article like a decade ago and it stuck in my head as interesting. I am certain it should be easy work considering how obvious it seems to you. 
<|endoftext|>It also tracked the Olympic dates. There is a very cool youtube series about a guy making a replica using a lot of tools of the time. Check out clickspring. He later uses modern tech to speed up the process.

<|endoftext|>Im going to be honest; 90% of your post makes no sense to me but I'll say these few things. 1. Idk where your getting this YouTube vs peer review thing. I haven't watched 1 YT video on this thing and in my googling, all the peer reviewed articles I came across concluded it's a complex and fairly accurate astronomical model of the celestial bodies known at that time. 2. You dont ever present any case other that "peer review says" and "people dont understand gears." Neither of which are an actual argument. 3. A wheel with markings wouldn't be an analog computer by itself. It needs to interact with other computational elements. A slide rule is an analog computer though. Basically just a couple marked sticks you slide past each other.  
<|endoftext|>the huge swathes of desert today (such as the sahara or gobi) was supposedly created by an ancient global war by some theories..so perhaps if we dig we might find some ruins
<|endoftext|>Hey, I'm a few days late to this thread but I wanted to say that I agree with you 100% about memes interrupting the flow of conversation and distracting from the topic at hand. It irritates the shit out of me too. Reddit used to have a much more intelligent/mature userbase, before it blew up and got as popular as Facebook. I would come here to learn, stretch my brain, and be frequently blown away by the discussions. You can still find that in certain subs, this being one.. don't get me wrong, I enjoy some memes and pun threads as much as anyone, but there's a time and place for everything. 
<|endoftext|>He stated that the local people used it as an administrative center. He goes on to share that the ancient people had a chemical paste for softening stone that would make it like clay.He said those people are descendents of humanity's second fall from greatness.  Their technology remained in small circles but wasn't really understood. Over time the relics were lost.  It's a wild read and hard to put down once you start reading.  I do think it's some kind of soft disclosure however. The person dropping the info really gives less and less info as you go on it seems.  In the beginning he tells about how we're all being held in a state of lower technology on purpose to benefit those in power and prevent upheaval. Towards the end he seems to hush those kinds of details to an extent. 
<|endoftext|>Because I've read up quite a bit on it, and 100s of thousands of people have done this kind of stuff on a regular basis, there is no conspiracy, carbon dating is soild science.Light speed has to do with we know the universe is billions of years old and unimaginably large, giving plenty of time for a long history of life and most likely common in the universe.Because creationism is the largest group of people that believe human history is very short, and sadly use a lot of flawed science to push their idea.
<|endoftext|>So your opinion that "science doesn't feel right, man" supercedes all of the collaborative effort of scientists? Just making sure we are on the same page here.
<|endoftext|>That is very interesting. I never knew that about coral reefs. I also believe that 13,000 years of soil is probably making it hard to find as well. Check out Gunung Padang. There is a megalithic site on top of the "hill" in west java, but that hill is apparently man-made. The excavation is still underway, but there appears to be a massive pyramid under the hill. Core samples are saying that the pyramid is 20,000 years old. 
<|endoftext|>Nowhere on page 18 does Alterwelt admit to lying about anything.
<|endoftext|>Thats the very description of the logical fallacy of argument of authority.  Theres a reason its a fallacy. 
<|endoftext|>I wish we could get more Mel Brooks movies. Could you imagine if he tried to release Blazing Saddles now?
<|endoftext|>Its extraordinary, just not ancient lost civilization or technology extraordinary. Also... got sources? I just doublechecked and they have around 1200 yr difference in line with what ive said like 5x here already. Please dont link me to youtube... :)Edit: and hypothesized 37 gears still doesnt mean theyve found more than bits of 2...
<|endoftext|>Sad reality is peer reviewed data on this says it ia very much open to interpretation and likely a mariner centric timepiece, an astrological clock. Just because youtubers profoundly hypothesize bullshit doesnt make it so. Also, dont cite wikipedia... outnumbering people doesnt make you right. It makes you a mob.Edit: ive passed my 2 response per limit topic here. I do this because theres no point arguing with someone citing youtube vids with agendas... i have no interest in circling the drain with you. 
<|endoftext|>1. As ive said many times this is the only place you see the claim predicting astrological events occur. I think maybe this post has branched more than 2 response trees. Claim is in both.2. Mobile, cant link well. Sorry cant do any better excuse is honesty. I have mentioned adding peer review or .edu to any google queries on topic. And i have implored people to seek peer reviewed comparisons. But im refuting claims anyways, burden of proof is on claimant citing hearsay.3. Youre right, it isnt a computer, it contains none of the parts that would differentiate computing. Gears and housing alone powered by man dont compute astrological events. Ty thats very helpful here :) More lost time and karma yippeeeee. Youd love my take on dyatlov pass :*
<|endoftext|>Well, that's just, like your opinion man.See I can make meme jokes too.But really, a lot of people care. That's why my comment got upvoted. This is one of the only places I would expect reddit to care. This place is supposed to be about free, open discussion...and when a control mechanism is used to limit conversation right in front of us, I would expect some people to be irratated. It doesn't matter if it was on accident, it stopped the conversation pretty effectively. If you look at those jokes on reddit you will find the same trend in every thread...it stops the original topic in place. So even if its just in fun, it's kind of messing with the whole point of /r/conspiracy.You know memes and memetics have value and are real right? For a long time I might add. The Navy has done research on them, as well as many respected people over time. It's not coincedence that memes have become popular in the last decade or so.That's what /r/prequelmemes has been doing, even if its just a joke and on accident. That's why it's gaining in popularity and it stops conversations everywhere it happens. That's the meme magic of /r/prequelmemesBut yeah.....not a big deal
<|endoftext|>Very interesting, I feel the truth is most likely between that and what is written in text books, I personally am really tired of this whole pyramids are tombs bullshit they spew out since almost none of them ever even had evidence of someone burried in them.Also I find it odd that the newer ones seem to be less awesome, we lost technology from 2800BC from making Giza to 1800BC making them out of mud bricks 
<|endoftext|>Don't waste your time. Unless you want to be explaining the results of science and physics in the last 400 years, history that he regards as having been all faked by evil smart people, so resourceful that they faked the life achievements of the worlds most brilliant minds! 
<|endoftext|>Strawmen are for stupid people. Please rise above the juvenile nonsense.I am asking for **empirical evidence** to support the claims being made.
<|endoftext|>Its on page 118 actually 
<|endoftext|>It honestly makes me sad to think that movies of that calibre just cant be released these days for fear of major backlash. But then I just watch Blazing Saddles again and feel better that at least there was a time hat they could be made. 
<|endoftext|>No one has linked any YouTube videos. Why do you keep bringing "YouTube videos with an agenda" when no one has linked any? 
<|endoftext|>I just looked the wikipedia page which I though was what you wanted. And it says "*the first reliably documented one was created by the Chinese mechanical engineer Ma Jun (c. 200265 CE) of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms*". And in any case is just a chariot, I'm sure there are other inventions that are far superior to this chariot and still have not surprised researchers as much as the Antikythera mechanism. And if you think they have found only bits of two gears maybe it's the reason why you don't see how extraordinary was this tool. Then again I repeat, I'm not the guy you were talking before, I agree with you that it has nothing to do with ancient civilizations, never mind Atlantis. But still it changes our view about what we were able to craft at that time. By a long shot.
<|endoftext|>the person you are arguing with claims they are not siting youtube videos and they never mentioned a youtube video. 
<|endoftext|>Ive totally observed this situation countless times in threads on this sub without ever thinking of it like that. Jokes do completely ruin or hinder the flow of topics of conversation online. My question might have been that short to warrant the sarcastic response but it was still a real question looking for answers. Makes me wonder how much is lost when this happens. 
<|endoftext|>An innocuous statement in a thread does not limit conversation. It doesnt stop others from adding to the dialogue. 
<|endoftext|>I think the weird part here is that you seem to be immediately hopping to the defence against global warming, while missing the point that the discussion is about sea levels hundreds of thousands of years ago, if not millions. Do you think the grand canyon came out of nowhere? Do you think the great lakes were always there? This understanding of changing geography and landscape has been known and accepted for a long time. Hell, this is grade 9 geography.
<|endoftext|>"Yes all faked so they can.... Ummmm.... Be evil!!"Yeah I know the types, it's like flat earthers, can't even get a straight answer on why anyone would go through the trouble to lie about something like that lol
<|endoftext|>Yeah, they do it in freaking college labs and classes all over the world for nearly 100 years now. A low estimate would say 1-2k people do a hands on learning for it at least once a year. It isn't super secret shit, you can pay like $500 to have anything carbon dated to most Universities.... The only really difficult part is you need a clean room and be smart about contamination. Easy peasy....Anyone could spend about 15 grand to setup everything you need to do basic carbon dating yourself in a small room and prove its wrong, which you will just prove it's right.
<|endoftext|>So the peer reviewed "carbon dating" and "speed of light" don't meet your high standards of science like " they are lying to us man". Gotcha.
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the clarification. Allegedly it's not just a person, but a group of people answering through the Alterwelt account. On page 127 Alterwelt comes back and claims part of their group tried to end the thread but it wasn't agreed upon. He(they) start answering questions again.
<|endoftext|>Fair enough, I feel similarly in many cases. Just have to be careful not to dismiss good work because it wasnt produced by a prestigious professor. 
<|endoftext|>I wonder that same thing. that guy just has this super smug nopyness to his comments. he has this attitude like he should know what is and isn't a computer he was making computers out of sane and turtle shells before the pyramids existed.
<|endoftext|>They keep mentioning youtube videos as well, and no one has even linked one about this.I was never making some claim about this being some proof of a lost prehistory, but more along the lines of it changes our understanding of the sophistication of the tech available during known history.But I guess I and everyone else is crazy about this topic because "youtube videos". \_()_/
<|endoftext|>Theyre citing (its citing btw... citation) things only found in youtube vids and shit conspiracy pandering blogs... when i see 'predict astrological events' i know what im dealing with here. Thats stupid, you can just look at it and know theres literally no way to reverse engineer that info. Or that that is information gears can provide... yeah its stupid. Thats kool aid nonsense and also when i realize theres little point continuing talk. 
<|endoftext|>ok it has been a while now. scroll back in this conversation and see if there is any flow left from the original comment/question "you ever wonder whats under all that sand?"to me it looks like no one wants to talk about it anymore and even I am here commenting on the state of the memeing and joking derailing the topic. jokes aside lets have a serious discussion for a change.

<|endoftext|> A low estimate would say 1-2k people do a hands on learning for it at least once a year.'Hands-on learning' of what? Carbon dating? 
<|endoftext|>I didn't see anyone correcting your obvious grammatical mistakes in not 1 but 2 of your previous posts....but I digress, you sound like a pompous douche who keeps making up straw man arguments about only things that YOU mention.
<|endoftext|>It's like all the top comments in threads about Zuckerberg quickly devolving into meme circlejerks.
<|endoftext|>School exists to teach you how to learn. They taught me how to research and understand. And I have done so, often outside of their norms. And even so, I see you have decided to ignore my main point to try and shift the argument towards what you believe to be the weak point: me talking about rising sea levels in the past.Do you have any comments on that? 
<|endoftext|>Yes, so when people say carbon dating is fake, or a lie I call bullshit because you would have to get 100k plus people to keep the lie up. is a short list of the top schools with geology masters programs in the US. That list would mean there are about 300-500+ people in the US alone every year getting in-depth and hands on training in carbon dating. It's not fake, it's not made up. It's soild and proven science.
<|endoftext|>What is your idea if empirical evidence? I'm honestly curious. Is the main factor that it agrees with you?Also, where did I say "hands on" Mr "that's a strawman"?
<|endoftext|>Nah, thread got split in 2 lines of reaponses. Conspiracy does bring out the douche... can only keep saying the same stuff, cant prove a negative. Every now and then its worthwhile, and people always worth the gamble... doesnt mean the gamble pays off. Keep up the quality content tho. And... typos =/= not knowing how to spell shit. Cya dummy. 
<|endoftext|>How does one do 'hands-on' learning of carbon dating?Or by 'hands-on', do you mean hands on a textbook, rote learning the same dogma as everybody else?
<|endoftext|>Glad to see you acknowledge how you act. That's the first step. Just a tip, aside from what nonsense you say you might want to proof-read what you post before you do. That way you might only look like an ass that doesn't know what your talking about. At least you'll be spelling it correctly.
<|endoftext|>You take anything made of carbon, bone, wood, ect, you take it into a clean room, you place it into an airtight box, you drill a hole and take a peice that was not exposed to air, messure it's weight.You burn it while collecting the smoke that is then fed into an instrument that counts the particles, the ratio of C14 compared to C12 tells you it's age, as the C14 degrades into C12 at a specific rateI did a search, you can pay the grad students of a university in Florida to do this for you for under $500. It isn't complex, it's done all over universities every week. Sure if you are getting a BA in geology then it's msot likely text book work, but there are 100s in geology doctorial programs every semester across the states and I'm sure 1000s when you look at the whole globe.If it didn't work, someone would write a paper about it and it would be tested 100 fold because that happens all the time with scientific methods and research every day.

<|endoftext|>When i saw these Hampstead Children years ago when this video came out there were about 10 other videos that came out with it. I remember clearly the kid saying they were "taken to pizza shops where people did sex on them." This was years before pizzagate happened. [ lets watch what their mother has to say. [ compare that the father. [ guy is a terrible actor. He is a baby eater. 
<|endoftext|>Allow me to chip in with what will undoubtedly be seen as a provocative post. Human sex trafficking is being blurred purposefully by the media. On the one hand, there is the very real child trafficking from third world and war other torn countries, this trafficking is being carried out by organisations most people think are 'there to help '.However, the lines are being blurred by the adult trafficking, where, it is claimed the women thought they were getting jobs as cleaners or au pairs but were forced by wicked men into prostitution. These are almost always complete bullshit. Allow me to explain. I know of a couple who operated in Paris, they would go to cambodia, Vietnam and northern regions of thailand to recruit prostitutes. They would arrange visas, pay for flights and provide accommodation. The girls all knew they would be prostitutes, but told their parents that they had been offered real jobs in France. This couple would provide all clients for the girls and until their debt had been paid they needed to pay 30% of their earnings to the couple. Once the debt had been paid they just paid 10% of their earnings. All of this is made clear to the girls. So, off they went to be prostitutes. Even with the 30% deductions they would be making more money than they could ever hope to earn in their home countries. Please remember these girls are whores, they were whores back home too. One thing whores do better than anything is lie. They lie to punters "you're so handsome", "i love a fat man", "i prefer older men" etc. They lie to their friends and family "i work at the airport", "i have a rich boyfriend" etc. Yet you all think that when the police raid their brothels they suddenly become bastions of truth? Think about it. They get raided and they have two choices, tell the truth and be immediately imprisoned, have all their belongings confiscated and await deportation. Or, say they thought they were going to be a cleaner but the evil men forced them to be whores. This story will get them immediately put on a working visa, authorities will try to get them proper jobs, pay for their education and give them full welfare rights. No surprises for guessing theyll claim to have been trafficked. Just go on holiday to Thailand. Go to any border control and look at the queues of young girls all waiting to get in. You can see the girls who are wanting to get in to become whores, and there are thousands of them. Often travelling alone or with just one other friend. There is an over abundance of girls willing to be whores. The same is true of eastern europe, they are awash with prostitutes. Why would you need to force anyone to do something that an over supply of people are willing to do? You wouldn't! These adults who claim to have been trafficked are being used as a smokescreen for the real trafficking that is going on. Almost all the busts are dealing with adults, not kids.

Which it is. **They were vacation buddies on Marthas Vineyard who would play dominoes together, hence the reference to playing dominoes.

Do you think Ill do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?There are precious references before this email to Sandler and Podesta playing dominos on vacation together in the Podesta emails: more context:From this email in May 2014: I've rented a house in the Vineyard Haven area of Martha's Vineyard, arriving Saturday, August 23, departing September 2. Susan and Steve and a friend of the family from Hawaii, Sherry Broder will be joining us. We have a couple of extra bedrooms. You and Mary can join us for all or part of the 10 days we'll be there.From this email in February 2015 We have rented the same house on Martha's Vineyard as last year, from July 5 to the 12th. Would you like to join us for the week or some portion thereof? Please advise.Thats how we know they vacationed together on Marthas Vineyard From this email, July 2015 (the dates above established as when Sadler is in Marthas Vineyard) Last day in MV. Missed you. Susan whipped Sherry and me at Dominos. Using the Podesta method, she made up the rules as we played. Shows theyve played dominoes before in MV (Marthas Vineyard), jokingly accuses Podesta of making up the rules as he goesFrom this email, December 2014 I just received the holiday package of pasta and sauce. If only I could make it turn out as special as you guys do. Thats how we know he has gifted Sandler pasta the year beforethe original email I quoted says Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, So instead of getting pasta like he had the last year, he got cheeses this year.The joke is do you think Ill play dominoes better (remember, he got whipped on his last vacation) having ate the cheese you gifted me this year rather than the pasta you gifted me last year?

<|endoftext|>There will be dismissals and controversy in this topic. Expect red herring political smokescreens with partisan lies and ridicule. Go beyond. Pizza toppings are just theories. Be more selective with your conspiracy here people. The monsters don't want to be found and a real story lurks in the networks beneath. For the deniers, lets start with the undeniable monsters. Jimmy Saville. Mark Dutroux. Shocking and disturbing. The facts are chilling. But isn't it strange how brazen, boastful and connected they were?Whilst they imply Royal associations the tentacles go beyond elite Hapsburg bloodlines. The Michael Aquino cases involved military cover-ups. The Franklin Affair was neutered by judges. The Finders torn apart by the media. The point is that establishment rings are the usual suspects for this conspiracy. So it may be more relevant to ask why than ask who.. So why?Is it a recipe for Disassociative Identity Disorder? Some macabre twist from MK-Ultra programs to condition the most appalling human programming? Or is it less weaponised and more trade related? Consider how sheiks are sweetened with bacha bazi dancing boys and there is a pattern in Middle East oil negotiations. Is this some commoditised trade network to do blind eye despot deals on the resource chessboard? It plausible if you consider the main pizza references emerged after unforeseen leaks of state dept emails after Hilary's email server got gang hacked by spooks. But then why would so many priests get caught in this controversy? Is there is also some extreme sociopath behaviour that is more prone to corrupt inside these individuals? Or perhaps there is something more sinister and organised in society? Something that penetrates all power institutions? If so what the fuck is that?

But this has not happened \- why do you think this is?
<|endoftext|>People act like pizzagate is some republican plan to conspire against Hillary, why can't people just look at the facts?

Hillary & Bill cofounded the Clinton Foundation with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein; HRC's closest aide Huma Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner was convicted of sexting a minor; and of course Weinstein who everyone knows about now (and John and Tony Podesta are lesser known examples too). **How many of your friends or business partners are convicted pedophiles or serial rapists, and why hasn't Hillary denounced them yet?**

<|endoftext|>This thread is going to be interesting to watch!Nonetheless politics aside, one thing I never see discussed is psychology behind why elites engage in pedophilia. Personally I have my own theory. I read in article years ago that one way chimps display dominance is stealing the baby from the mother chimp and then eating it in front of them (the article below describes such behavior). Seeing as how humans are related to chimps, I believe this is why the elites engage in pedophilia and other sexual assault. See its one thing to be able to dominant and exploit a person. Its an entirely different level of power and evil to be able to exploit someones children and for them to be powerless to stop it.

<|endoftext|>In the response to the new Qposts. Especially: #FutureProvesPast #TrustNoOne I think people need to start looking at the connections with Jones, Stone, and Megyn Kelly. Joe Biggs left Infowars after he was covering the weird emails from Podesta involving pedo language. Then Alex went on and on about a False Flag and blaming him/Infowars. Well what do you know. It happened, exactly like he said. It was like he had "good intel" or he "knows the Globalist". Because some dude shot a computer in Ping Pong Pizza parlor and it was blamed on infowars. Then Megyn Kelly did an interview with the owner of Ping Pong Pizza to discredit Infowars when she was still on Fox. Then the lawsuit emerged from the owner of Ping Pong Pizza and Alex made an official statement about it being fake. It was no longer discussed. Then there was the epic Megyn Kelly interview where it was a supposed "hit job" on Alex. He recorded her and posted. Blah blah blah. Then when you go back in time before the election during the debate hosted by Megyn Kelly she asked Trump the question about women. That was the one where Trump said, Only Rosie O'Donnell. Roger Stone resigned from the campaign (Trump claimed he fired him). Then a little later he joins Infowars. All of this is very weird. Jones has been in a lot of films and the media all make fun of him. He seems like he doesn't even bat an eye to all the negativity. It is looking to me like that is his job. It doesn't bother him and he is not afraid, because he is in on it. He has people all over the place using him as a "scapegoat" to make fun of "truthers". He freaks out with hysteria and fake crying. He makes sure guest don't say certain things. It's like he is, "controlled opposition".Or better yet....they are all connected to the SEX CULT!

<|endoftext|>  Personally I find the Podesta stuff pretty incriminating, but the actual pizza place/Alefantis seems like a massive ton of conjecture. Other than a gay guy with a weird sense of humor who takes a lot of pics with his goddaughter, is there any actual evidence?

<|endoftext|>I like to think about this as if everything that Podesta/Alefantis was accused of as merely coincidental just to see if it changes my mind. The freaky art and performances are simply a progressive, urban art style that my simple conservative mind cant understand. The association with known pedos and deviants like Epstein, Silsby, Clinton, Weiner, and Richards are all coincidental. Just because their associates are guilty of certain crimes, doesnt mean that Pgate is automatically true. Their relationships are established as somewhat close but not necessarily beyond a business capacity. These are wealthy people after all. Bill Clinton really is Chelseas father and Danney Williams is a hoax. We can never definitively prove either parentage without DNA, no matter how similar in appearance Hubbell/Williams may be to their alledged progenitors. All of the weird sexual comments involving minors and murder are unfortunately timed private jokes not meant for widespread scrutiny. All of the money associated with the political connections are no different than when conservative heavyweights promote their causes, and does not indicate a black market cabal. Clinton et al. really are simply progressive patriots that only wish to champion liberal causes and ideals but cant escape constant stumpings by Trump.

<|endoftext|>Except this video and her allegations were debunked years ago and can be traced back to the satanic panic of the 80s and 90s.This interview came from a psychiatrist who claimed that people who have experienced trauma suppress their memories, and a certain kind of treatment can recover these memories. It turned out to be total bullshit. It's basically the power of suggestion and coercing events. It actually had devastating consequences as a lot of people went to jail from people all of a sudden "remembering" things that didn't happen.After the satanic panic subsided, the psychiatrist admitted it was flawed. "Stuff You Should Know" covered this in more detail in [their podcast.]( Satanic panic began with this book, Michelle Remembers  informed about this stuff, none of these satanic cannibal pedo sex rings had been proven true.  was first pointed out in the United States that no material evidence of ritual or satanic practices had been forthcoming in any of the cases in which they had been alleged. In Britain the position has been substantially the same as far as allegations of satan-worshiping rituals are concerned. As one journalist put it, in a phrase that has become well-known: **Investigations have produced no bodies, no bones, no bloodstains, nothing.** In the United States, the only adult witness to corroborate the testimony of children in a case has continued to claim that her evidence was given to get it all over with and was the result of plea-bargaining. An FBI agent, Kenneth Lanning, has reported that he has been unable to document any satanic murders in the United States. While this book was being written, a report of a very large study carried out be Gail Goodman and associates in the United States claimed that none of the cases reported to them produced any evidence of the existence of organized satanic worship that included sexually abusing children. of satanic ritual abuse allegations]( ---  During the 1980s and 90s a moral panic about alleged satanic ritual abuse occurred, mainly in parts of the English speaking world. This was propagated by certain psychotherapists, social workers, Christian fundamentalists and law enforcement officials. Some of the cases ended in prosecution and imprisonment. Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have had several incidents of alleged SRA which received national and international news coverage. Other countries have also had isolated events in which abuse or murder took place with satanic ritual elements, including Argentina and Brazil. ---

<|endoftext|>Reddit = corporate censorship. Alternatives: Voat.co, Saidit.net, Gab.aiDo yourself a favor and opt-out!Here's the app I'm using to edit my comments: should too! 
<|endoftext|>I know you don't want to hear this (and you'll probably think I'm some sort of troll, rather than a middle aged New Englander and mother), but this is the way people my age (50s-60s) write, socially. Yes, it is. It's idiomatically correct, complete with weekends 'at the farm' and 'being entertained by the grandkids in the pool'. It's the way a certain slice of polite society writes, semi-formally. I enjoy Reddit and find this sub fascinating at times, and I'm not commenting on the broader topic here. But regarding these emails: you have this piece (at least) wrong. This is, in fact, the way socially well connected, good friends communicate. 
<|endoftext|>IMO, this is the weakest part of the pizzagate 'evidence'The 'real meanings' of these 'codes' were just a random image post on 4chan, nothing backing them up.The real sort of 'damning' thing that I've never really seen an adequate explanation for is James Alefetanis' instagram profile. Some real eye\-brow raising stuff on there, with ACTUAL pedo\-slang. No one has ever really explained why his insta profile picture is Antinous.Also, Alefetanis has shown up on 4chan and threatened a pizzagate researcher with veiled threats of grievous bodily harm.ALSO: how hardcore this thing was buried and stopped, to me, lends credence to it's veracity.I've dug so deep into this shit, and once you do, you realize 'pizzagate' is a bad term, because it makes people think, 'oh yah, children in a hidden basement in a pizza parlor, riiiiight' But the real issue is political pedophilia, which has been shown time and time again, in court documents no less, to exist. Once you understand the profile of a psychopath, you can begin to understand how most people in high positions of power ARE psychopaths; from there, it makes sense that they'd get off on 'the destruction of something innocent', as it's the most transgressive thing ever and THEY can get away with it, also because it's the ultimate feeling of being God. These people don't experience empathy, compassion, fear, anxiety...they can only feel 'power'.TL;DR \- political pedophilia is real, 'pizzagate' is kind of a misnomer for what this investigation has become.
<|endoftext|>It's worth remembering that so much of the "evidence" for Pizzagate consists of out of context snippets of emails that were hacked and dumped by Russian intelligence. 
<|endoftext|>Nicely put.The only reason Pizza has any connection to pedogate is that on 4chan, CP is referred to as Cheese Pizza. To 4channers, pizza is synonymous with CP.
<|endoftext|>There was nothing about live stream Web cams on the blog and it wasn't run by Tamera. Old comment I've saved below : was a blog of cute baby pictures with a few videos. Tamera Luzzatto did not run the blog, Evie's father did.The blog was not invite-only until internet stalkers started harassing the Luzzattos. There is a little bit archived here:  were more pictures archived on sli.mg but that site has been down since mid-January.As you can see, there's nothing unusual about the photos *at all*. Also, the father tries to make humorous remarks on nearly every picture. People are trying to insinuate that there's something sinister about the phrase "raw and uncut", but that's just the way he writes. EDIT: Well, after looking at the header on the archive.is page, I figured out there are more pages archived.Here is the biggest group of pictures:  you can see, there's nothing suspicious about *any* of the pictures.And [here is the first post on the blog:]( This is where the magic happens! Welcome! If you are here you are one of the first people to view Evie's blog!

<|endoftext|>There are many significant and explosive U.S. and world pedo events involving current in-office leaders (across the political spectrum). But I never see them posted here.I refuse to post them because Reddit is a potential military/intelligence propaganda wet dream, mods are unelected & unaccountable, and even this thread is being manipulated. Moreover, as I wrote in this thread in a now-hidden comment, the Military-Industrial-Pedo Complex (as Eisenhower should have called it) is way bigger than a Pizza Shop or the Clinton Foundation. CF has $250 million, and the Pentagon has famously "lost" trillions. Why wouldn't the military love a decoy Clinton scapegoat? According to Fiona Barnett, the U.S. military breeds their own off-the-books children for sex, slavery & sacrifice. Why bother with risky human trafficking? They just breed their own -- which was also suggested by The Finders children who had never seen running water, television or electricity.
<|endoftext|>If anyone has any doubts this "conspiracy" isn't 100% partisan, mention something about Trump and Epstein or Epstein and Acosta and watch if you get downvotes or upvotes. 
<|endoftext|>A lot of conservatives who believe pizzagate is real believe it is bipartisan and that the Bush family was involved.
<|endoftext|> The Bush and Reagan administrations we're investigated several years ago, for using the services of a call boy ring. here is picking favorites, and part of branding the investigation as a partisan "witch hunt" was a way to smear our efforts. Look up the Franklin scandal, several high level republicans were implicated.
<|endoftext|>Pizzagate goes on both sides of the political isle. Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager running an elite sex ring out of a pizza shop along with other DNC heavyweights is disinformation. NXIVM is part of the elite sex ring without a doubt. Allison Mack is singing like a bird and she is just the tip of the iceberg. This is a global problem and its a global network. 
<|endoftext|>That's bull crap. The Franklin Scandal had Bush and other republicans involved and I think it's all connected. Stop making this partisan.
<|endoftext|> the "facts" of pizzagate are all a republican's wet dreamThe Pizzagate Scandal has brought a lot of attention to human trafficking. I know a lot of people learned about the Franklin Credit Union Scandal with Republican Lawrence E. King after reading about Pizzagate.Also in the Podesta Emails, Tony Podesta [talks about his close relationship with Fmr. Speaker of the House and serial child molester/Republican Dennis Hastert.]( know for sure that Pizzagate has "red-pilled" a lot of people about the [Fmr. Republic President George H. W. Bush's Midnight Call Boy Scandal.]( lot of Republican Scandals are being discovered because of the discussions on Pizzagate. [Plus we have a history of Israeli, British, and Russian agents blackmailing US Congress Members through elite pedophile rings in Washington D.C.]( so it's definitely not just democrats. Without a single victim having come forward?It would be very difficult for victims of human trafficking to just come forward, especially if they're very young kids, which they would be in this case; if not toddlers.Actually I will link you to an alleged victim: [I was sexually assaulted 8 years ago by the Pizzagate guy, owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis AMA!]( interesting case. A lot of info was scrubbed. I'm sure you can find some archives/screen shots out there. He posted a picture, but I'm not sure if it's in the thread. I know he 100% posted a picture. He would've had to put in a lot of effort to fake all of this. Here are some alleged emails between the victim and James Alefantis:  story goes that James Alefantis raped the guy in the AMA, and he *also* raped Comet Ping Ping Co-Owner Carole Greenwood's son. He allegedly raped him in the kitchen. I do remember reading an article where Carole's son Dylan stayed over in a big house together with James Alefantis and David Brock in Georgetown, but that would've been before the age he would've been according to the AMA. My point is they do have a link. I think the question is, why did Carole Greenwood quit Comet Ping Pong? An article has stated that it was due to family reasons. Did James Alefantis do something to her son?
<|endoftext|>Dude a bunch of emails got dumped and we read through them and investigated the people in them and sending them and they were/are fucked
<|endoftext|>The amount of projection in that thread is astounding. People speak out against what they consider a gross injustice, and they try to spin it into being a "defense" of said injustice, which makes no sense whatsoever. They're really reaching, with this one.
<|endoftext|>Certain users are suspiciously upvoted too. Kinda blatant. They should try being a little more subtle if they wanna be believable. 
<|endoftext|>I think it makes perfect sense that select, high-ranking government people would be into pedo stuff. A lot of these people get into government because they're narcissists who crave power, a typical trait for narcissists. Another typical trait for narcissists: feeling above the law/morality. Combine a lack of morality with a craving for extreme dominance and control, and you have a recipe for a rapist or pedophile. 
<|endoftext|> Ben Swann's Pizzagate report from last year. His social media went dark after this video.
<|endoftext|>Idk if you know about it but /r/greatawakening would love your work. I know youve been doing this since the beginning, and its all good work. Apparently were getting close. 
<|endoftext|>The thing is he is right.Global pedophile ring? Legit.Hillary Clinton + Pals running paedophilic rng out of edgy pizza pallor? Obvious horse shit.
<|endoftext|>They use art as not only a way to laundry money, but as a symbol and the art is very telling what this man is into. Signs and symbols rule the world. I know for a fact this is how they do this, Check out Darin Vance from WA. He was just convicted, took only five years. This is how they communicate thru visual, borderline criminal content that is hard to bring justice to. 
<|endoftext|>there is however reasonable evidence for the use of coded language. The accused has never once addressed this, been asked by the media about this, or tried to explain himself. Being emailed to ask if you wanted your used handkerchief with a 'pizza map' on it returned is not normal, and it deserves scrutiny. 
<|endoftext|>Nothing for 3 months but when the pizzagate bell rings you're here in 5 minutes. I'm impressed.This should be an interesting thread.
<|endoftext|>Tony is good friends with serial child molester Dennis Hastert, who served as speaker of the house for nearly a decade. Tony and John both have EXTREMELY questionable interests in art, a long with James Alefantis. Bill Clinton is good friends with convicted child trafficker and pedo Jeffrey Epstein, who was in a relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell (daughter of Mossad agent Robert Maxwell) and was sued by Virginia Roberts who has claimed she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew under age. She is also pictured with Prince Andrew. Those are the facts. It is very eyebrow rising and what I touched on is literally only the tip of the iceberg. 
<|endoftext|>Did you look at all the evidence? That's like saying there is no indication 9/11 was an inside job.
<|endoftext|>"Trump's campaign chair" is pretty misleading. He was in charge of a state-level RNC campaign office (in OK iirc). He was prosecuted, and rightfully so. There were quite a few mainstream articles about the case, and essentially nobody, here or anywhere, made any effort to defend him or what he did.
<|endoftext|>The two topics are pretty closely related, and there has always been bleed-over between Hollywood and the political world. Assuming Pedogate and Pizzagate are true, there are undoubtedly predators and victims who have one foot in both.
<|endoftext|> Hollywood Attorney is stating he was murdered down to confronting Oman royalty over his "new" minor wife. Upon confronting the man, he was murdered the next day.
<|endoftext|>can you link to the video? im not sure what i should be looking for..Edit: nevermind.. i see it was linked below.. disregard.
<|endoftext|>He has responded actually.Pizzagate crazies: you can keep it up but its 100% false. Watch your man Alex Jones grovel and then get a life 
<|endoftext|> How many of your friends or business partners are convicted pedophiles or serial rapists, and why hasn't Hillary denounced them yet?Why hasnt Trump denounced Roy Moore ? Oh wait ... 
<|endoftext|>I was taught growing up , you are who your friends are...birds of feather...etc.....one thing Ive realized cause PG, theres a lot more people who want to bang kids on this planet than I ever could have imagined.

<|endoftext|>Changing the rules for one thread but not for all is interesting. Any good conspiracy theorist sees manipulation and wonders whose agenda is being served.
<|endoftext|>Always look out for [common forum disruption tactics]( Be aware of the [massive number of online shills]( attempting to control public opinion. Don't believe the votes on reddit, most of the shilling operations have large numbers of vote bots.
<|endoftext|>It randomises the comment thread order each time you load, and hides the scores. It can help avoid certain comments getting no visibility from mass downvotes as the top comment could be upvoted or downvoted, but you wouldn't know. It's just so users can focus on what people are saying, as opposed to focusing on the numbers. 
<|endoftext|>If he wasn't, why would he have threatened a voat Pizzagate researcher with killing his entire family and "suing his dead body" if he didn't remove one of his posts exposing a property of Alefantis' as a potential trafficking hub, the "Pegasus Museum"?The simple answer is that the "threats" didn't actually happen and Ryan faked the whole thing. That report doesn't actually show what he told the police.* He [reported the supposed threat]( *hours after* he made/uploaded the video you link. You can check the upload time [here]( His only other evidence was screenshots. He's from Texas where a simple google search reveals conversations can be [lawfully recorded.]( Why didn't he record any of his conversations with the police, or the FBI? He even admits that the thought went through his head. Yet, no action...* He claimed he ["tried"]( to record his conversations with JA *twice*. One of the times he had a "buddy" next to him and neither of them thought to at least video-record the conversation. The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call, but Ryan still doesn't record the conversation (despite having allegedly been threatened before). Why didn't he ever call him back and record that?* He claimed to have reported Alefantis to the FBI and that they told him not to ["poke the bear"]( Yet, he continued to [talk about PG]( and [sell pizzagate merchandise]( for like a year afterwards. * If the FBI really looked into it, why haven't they found anything? Why didn't he ever provide evidence of the report? * If the FBI is "in on it" and/or he were really threatened by Alefantis, why would he continue to sell pizzagate merchandise and vlogging about pizzagate? It doesn't look like he took the "threat" very seriously. Or it was, you know, made up.
<|endoftext|>Comet Ping Pong was likely just a money laundering front. Alefantis (changed from Rothschild) is the crypto banker of the family. 
<|endoftext|>Never heard this one before but it's interesting. Sure makes the motive for their very public and very gruesome execution and the Clintons direct oversight of it as well.Then imagine any victims that might come forward could be shown that as a cautionary tale.
<|endoftext|>no there is not a shred of evidence. but that is why the less fortunate (cognitively) will continue to post as if there is. Its almost as sad as it is interesting. 
<|endoftext|>He's clearly guilty of something. If he wasn't, why would he have threatened a voat Pizzagate researcher with killing his entire family and "suing his dead body" if he didn't remove one of his posts exposing a property of Alefantis' as a potential trafficking hub, the "Pegasus Museum"? 
<|endoftext|>The Alefantis stuff is pretty strange however. Heres CPP being called out in 2008 people posting about comet ping pong  Alefantis' sister, Susan Alefantis wrote a letter in support of a teacher who was convicted of molesting 5 girls: is an article on the abuser: 
<|endoftext|>And Franklin Scandal victim Paul Bonacci stated that Lawrence King's pedo-ring was operated out of Fort Offutt. Bonacci said they knew LK at the guard gate, and waved him through without ID.Dutroux victims pointed the original investigators (who were removed) at Belgium's NATO headquarters.Australian elite-pedo whistleblower Fiona Barnett (now missing as of late 2017) said she was a child sex slave on U.S. military bases.
<|endoftext|>The name Arun Rao is connected through James Alefantis Instagram. He works for the DOJ and he is also responsible for prosecuting human traffickers. Many people have accurately pointed out between Arun Rao and Andrew Kline, this may be the most significant incident of the fox guarding the hen house we have ever seen. Pizzaowned by former DOJ employee Andrew Klinea position he was appointed to by Bill Clinton
<|endoftext|>that was obviously a cover up. It's definitely real. The victims who speak out are far more convincing than some "expert" debunking. They haven't been proven true because they own the system. They continue to get away with their crimes because of the apathetic public.  They created the system. Court houses are actually Satanic Temples created to take away humans natural law. The US government is actually still owned by the British baby eating Crown.  are the richest people in the world doing this stuff. The "El- ite". It is in the name itself. These rulers are satanists and they can continue to cover up the truth because they created the entire system. Just look at Michael Aquino... The guys started an off shoot of the The Satanic Church called the Temple of Set. He is an admitted Satanist and he was in charge of US military psychological operations. If that doesn't bring up any red flags in your mind, you've been got. Satanists run the world, of course their not going to bust themselves. heres Hillary Clinton in a leaked email by "russian hackers" (irrelevant) where she says she is going to sacrifice a chicken to Moloch in the Backyard.  
<|endoftext|>I dont think were disagreeing! Im trying to argue that this exchange is just an innocuous set of emails friends sent each other back and forth and nothing else!
<|endoftext|>Thank you for this. I honestly believe that some of the people that harp on what is said in some of those emails have ZERO clue on how some people speak to each other. In life it is important to be able to discern. Some around here dont have that gift.
<|endoftext|>one hundred percent this. and to understand that the lefts hard push for sexual acceptance also includes that of pedophilia, and that this issue is global and not just within the usa. in the uk for example labour \(leftleaning centrist party\)politician over here NAME REDACTED actually put her name on a legal document supporting a group known as PIE\(Pedophile information exchange\) who supported relationships between pedophiles and young male adolescents claiming: Paedophiles are ordinary, decent, sensible human beings, no more sexually depraved than yourself, and with a capacity for loving and helping children which is at present being repressed.If you, or I, were to go to work tomorrow and even suggest that we supported such views we would be fired and persecuted by those amongst us. However, for politicians this isn't damning? It shows how rife it.Is this truly a case of ancient wealth retaining ancient customs ala the ancient greeks and their boy\-loving ways? **#pedocracy**
<|endoftext|>The one email Id like an explanation for is the pizza related map handkerchief. That is the one that gets me. 
<|endoftext|>Thats bullshit. The people who hacked them told everyone how they did it. His password was literally p@ssword
<|endoftext|>If we're doing info dumps I've got some links to a load of original/early days pizzagate stuff. Cheesebay/Biff Skipman/Molokai, Hawaii, Haiti etc etc  
<|endoftext|>With all due respect, how is it spam? The dominoes on cheese or on pasta has been cited as evidence regarding Pizzagate in threads such as [this one]( provided context using primary sources, about a phrase that is commonly cited regarding pizzagate.

<|endoftext|>Children take time to raise. That is why, even though there may be evidence for them breeding their own children, it's not always the easiest way. 
<|endoftext|>How did Trump create these circumstances? We're these not the circumstances before he was elected? 
<|endoftext|>I'll give it a try. Ahem.According to that book on the Epstein evils, when Trump found out about Epstein's connections with underage rape stuff, he banned him from Mar-a-lago and his other properties.
<|endoftext|>The current republican party (as run by Trump) is extremely anti-bush, so that does not change my argument
<|endoftext|>Bush administration/s? had call boys.They were homosexuals liaisons between adults.  them with pedophile claims is disingenuous and homophobic.
<|endoftext|>Can't come forward if they never existed, either. And since there's no evidence of them existing at all...
<|endoftext|>This concerted effort to claim it was never about a pizza shop would work better if "pizza" wasn't in the name. 
<|endoftext|> The AMA was removed because after further inspection of the proof, it wasn't up to our standards. Once he has better proof, we'll be happy to let him repost it.Kind of an iffy link there.
<|endoftext|>If I make an AMA stating without evidence that Trump and Putin pounded my asshole in a Moscow hotel in 2013, will you cite that as proof too?
<|endoftext|> Actually I will link you to a victim: I was sexually assaulted 8 years ago by the Pizzagate guy, owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis AMA!That person's claims involve them being an adult when sexually harassed. As bad as that *might* be (given that it's a completely anonymous accusation), it's no where near the accusations of pedophilia, murder, or trafficking.Furthermore, when people ask for victims, they're not saying to show us victims coming forward. They are asking for evidence that the victims even exist. Were any of the accused behaving strangely right before a child they were involved with disappeared? Was blood found in their freezer? Do people consistently go missing after meeting them? These would be examples of some kind of evidence that the victims even *exist*.Pizzagate simply has none of this evidence. Only anonymous accusations. And in the case of the link you sent, not even really "pizzagate"-related, since they were not a minor, and weren't trafficked or murdered. Like I said earlier, not excusing that behavior **if** it's actually true, but it hardly supports your claim that pizzagate victims exist.
<|endoftext|>Australian elite-pedo victim Fiona Barnett, who was born into a pedo-ring run by a U.S. military network, said that the U.S. military breeds their own children for sex, slavery & sacrifice. The Finders were transporting children who had "never seen running water, television or electricity."Fiona Barnett has been almost 100% ignored by this subreddit. She was loud & vocal for years, had her own podcast & website, and then she went missing in late 2017.As of May 3, I guarantee you will find thousands of Pizzagate posts in a search of this subreddit. I guarantee you will find a couple dozen posts about Fiona Barnett maximum. Until later this week, so Reddit can cover their tracks. Fiona Barnett: A recently living witness who couldn't get the time of day from r/conspiracy. Maybe because she had no weaponized partisan political value?Maybe also because she dared blame the U.S. military, with its vast budget & international resources? And every pre-Pizzagate pedo-ring scandal supports that conclusion? Meanwhile it looks like I'm supposed to pay more attention to a Pizza shop who flaunt pedo symbols, than to the multi-trillion-dollar Pentagon. Alefantis *wants* you to notice, but with no victims who will prosecute (unlike Franklin, Fiona or Dutroux, all with military connections).

<|endoftext|>your username means I love kids in french.I love how you, of all user names, are so adamant about shutting down pedophile exposing discussions.
<|endoftext|>It's psychopaths, not narcissists. The dark triad, which is Machavellism, Psychopathy, and Narcissism. People think only serial killers have this, but serial killers are low\-functioning psychopaths that got caught. The more adept ones move into positions of power easily.I say 'psychopathy' because these people literally have a lower orbital lobe that has decreased or non\-existent functioning...that part of the brain is thought to be responsible for fear, anxiety, compassion, and empathy. People with a psychopathic brain are more likely to be into shit like pedophilia, as it's the ultimate form of 'power', one of the only 'emotions' they can 'feel'
<|endoftext|>Or is it the other way around, and the CIA supports the candidacy of pedophiles whom they can control while in office?Edit: see Dennis Hastert
<|endoftext|>But there's evidence that elite pedophile rings have existed in Washington D.C. Why is it so far-fetched to imagine operations taking place at various interconnected properties in D.C. If you're willing to admit that global pedophile rings exist, can you describe how you think the operations/logistics of an elite pedophile ring operating out of Washington D.C. would work?
<|endoftext|>Let's also remember that the idea that pizzagate was simply "Hillary Clinton + Pals running paedophilic rng out of edgy pizza pallor?" was the MSM story they used to discredit it, by taking the dumbest bits and omitting plenty of other aspects so they could "debunk" it. 
<|endoftext|>What's art got to do with Podestas emails?Why does laundering money through art indicate pedophile activity to you? 
<|endoftext|>If that user appears for pizzagate threads and you see them every time then you too appear for pizzagate threads. Interesting.
<|endoftext|>The same goes for fukushima and setagaya observer. Its like they have a bot that notifies when certain topics are discussed. Nah thats crazy I doubt it..
<|endoftext|> Tony is good friends with serial child molester Dennis Hastertthere are hundreds of people that are/were friends with Dennis Hastert. it doesn't mean anything in terms of convicting someone for being a pedophile/trafficker, nor does an interest in unconventional art.Bill Clinton is good friends with convicted child trafficker and pedo Jeffrey Epsteinso is Donald Trump, and hundreds of other people. again, it doesn't mean anything. Trump frequented Epstein's fantasy island like Clinton, but there are no accusations against him, nor should there be unless there's evidence suggesting otherwise.I don't know how narcissistic elites being friends with other narcissistic elites is eyebrow-raising.
<|endoftext|>Don't forget the email sent to John Podesta re: Hastert being busted"Might be time for Denny to vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island"

<|endoftext|>Lol....Also, note how it's the same few accounts spewing the same canned "debunking" talking points. 
<|endoftext|>There were more than a few comments complaining about the obvious vote manipulation before this happened. Only trolls had heavy upvotes and most of the regulars offering good faith comments with links to sources were in the negative. Setting sort to random solves the problem created by the vote manipulation, but unfortunately, you can't even see the votes anymore to know that it had happened. That's unfortunate. 
<|endoftext|>any great conspiracy theorist would recognize this can't serve an agenda because it's just randomizing everything. 
<|endoftext|>The simple answer is that the "threats" didn't actually happen and Ryan faked the whole thing. That report doesn't actually show what he told the police.Are you claiming that Ryan fabricated evidence against Alefantis, and filed a false report to the police \(a report they acknowledged as legitimate\), all as an elaborate ruse to sell more shirts? That doesn't sound very plausible to me.Sounds like it would be highly illegal and dangerous move to fabricate evidence against the 49th most powerful person in Washington D.C. If this is all a stunt as you claim, then why hasn't Ryan been arrested after filing the false report?I understand that attacking the credibility of a whistleblower or a witness is a common tactic in discrediting them.[
<|endoftext|>Dont they also use the art?Not sure if it's true, it is believable, elites use art shipments to smuggle because they somehow get a customs pass - on Ray Donovan show and I need to look into it.These tv shows for propaganda sure seem to give things away but maybe it's a psyop of nothing on tv is real. The syfy show Happy! Was insanely creepy and also satisfying as the dad went nuts.
<|endoftext|>I don't know anything about the name change or the laundering, but it's not entirely implausible, but I think what can be proved is that a lot of high powered DC pedo's liked to hang out there and all the creepy art/entertainment and ads by alefantis himself speak to this.
<|endoftext|>The art was for money laundering. Why else would Alefantis own Pegasus Art Museum, but not advertise or put any signs out showing it exists? 
<|endoftext|>Prepare for the nasty truth: it's pretty sad 
<|endoftext|>The government is arresting people for prostitution and calling it "sex trafficking." There is no "sex trafficking" and there is certainly no "child sex trafficking" in the U.S. but the PG nuts buy into everything that the government says.
<|endoftext|>The Facebook chat was faked. The guy that started the rumour runs www.pizzagategear.com and is trying to make money off it. He also has an unsuccessful patron which used to have text about supporting pizzagate investigation here  the police report *   (search Case #:**17000111**) * docdroid.net/LZTsdj5/policereport.pdf.htmlAnd here's a transcript of the alleged Facebook chat with James Alefantis which if you read it looks like it was written by an idiot.---The screen-captured chat went as follows:Alefantis: Just the Pegasus video. Figure out how to do it  no waves.ONeal: I am a super reasonable guy. You dont have to scare me like that.Alefantis: You can keep your kill room shit about the rest of it. Fix this and we are reasonable.[Alefantis then sent a picture of ONeail and his mom].Alefantis: Thanks. Feel ok?ONeal: Not really. Just threatened to kill everybody.Alefantis: No need for all of that.ONeal: Deleted the video.Alefantis: Good. Blame YouTube.ONeal: Delete the thread on Voat too?Alefantis: They are taking things down. I think be more creative. Say you think its nothing or something  its your culture. CAlm down and think about it first.ONeal: Ok.Alefantis: Lets look and discuss. This might be ok. Thank you. Let me know when you have calmed a bit.ONeal: Give me a week.Alefantis: Ha. Welcome to my world. Call me quick Ill be nice this time. I appreciate you taking down.ONeal: Im riding around with somebody. Gimme a minute.[Alefantis then sent a picture of ONeal and his girlfried].Alefantis: CuteONeal: Is that you being nice?Alefantis: Not yet. So call quick then I can go to bed with less worries.ONeal: Mods deleted posts on Voat. 5 minutes.Alefantis: Ok. Whats mods?ONeal: Moderators.Alefantis: Humm draws attention?ONeal: They deleted because my content was removed I guess. Reason: 1 2 3.Alefantis: Humm. Looks there.ONeal: Says deleted. It looks like you are trying to make money off this. Link doesnt work.Alefantis: Thats on Voat. ?.ONeal: About to call.[At this point ONeal called Alefantis back and said that he was nicer but still assured him he would die if he did not pull the video down].Alefantis: Ok. One more thing this happened to me. YOU  created this. You can uncreate.ONeal: Its an interesting subject. Just doing research on a hobby basically. I would never want myself or family to have any harm done because of this.Alefantis: Meaning  you created it for yourself  you can uncreate. Yeh well its good you didnt end up like Welch  in jail for 35 years. Or everyone who s getting sued. You can find a much more profitable and beneficial hobby.ONeal: I mean nothing I did was wrong but wrong or not its just not worth it.Alefantis: Actually lots of what you did is illegal. And punishable. But its expensive to sue. So people dont do it. I can explain it to you someday. There would also be criminal  state charges on some of it. But you would need someone smart enough and connected who wanted to make sure it was enforced. And so far you dont have that.ONeal: Took down the video. You win by a landslide.Alefantis: So go to sleep. Thank you for that. Its appreciated. And by the way this story is a pack of lies.ONeal: What is it then? Pure garbage?Alefantis: Yup. I mean that wall is the same wall.ONeal: Oh I confirmed that lol.Alefantis: But what the hell does that mean. And our families deserve to be safe.ONeal: No doubt. What yall building in the room? Why the trenches?Alefantis: You are too much man. On the edge of total destruction  still curious?ONeal: Im curious for myself. No worries.Alefantis: FBI liked your videos. So there is something. And. PLUMBING. Have you ever run plumbing?ONeal: lol.Alefantis: To build a room its not trenches. Any basic construction moron would see the differ next.ONeal: So the kill room stuff was just a joke?Alefantis: DifferenceONeal: IDK about that stuff.Alefantis: Ugh.ONeal: Sorry sorry Ill stop.Alefantis: You dont know what. Its a freaky room.ONeal: Construction.Alefantis: thats why people put shit on Instagram.[Alefantis then texted a photo of an old job in which ONeal worked on]Alefantis: You never moved pipes I guess. You are a decorator.ONeal: I designed a few bars. You like? Youre quite the designer.Alefantis: One more thing. If one of these assholes gets near my mom or her house thats it for you. Thats bethesdafellows is driving over tomororen.Im sure nothing will happen but if it does.ONeal: Theyve been talking about Pegasus for awhile.Alefantis: Everything they say about me is true. Except I dont like kids. At all. You should soon take all your shit down. Busted for profiteering.ONeal: Will do.Alefantis: Night.ONeal: Goodnight. Take it down now or later?Alefantis: Its your culture.ONeal: heard.Alefantis: Maybe all. Prob best. Disappear. Profiteer gone. Im going to protect my family now. Now or soon.ONeal: Will do.Alefantis: And I dont really want to hear about you again from anyone. Night Ryan.ONeal: Im telling you Im done. Way too real.Alefantis: Cute gf.ONeal: Thanks man.Alefantis: Lucky boy. Keep your Voat profile though. Xo.[Alifantis then sent a few emoticons: Two ping pong paddles, kissy lips, painted nails, and some money]. 
<|endoftext|> I don't see why anyone would make all that up.It's almost as if you've never watched Ancient Aliens...
<|endoftext|>It's definitely not real and nothing was covered up, the story was covered extensively in UK media. There is no evidence of a satanic pedo ring which is why the courts found no evidence of it.The fact you think the UK still owns the US says it all really. It's a hoax. that email was sent TO Hilary Clinton and is clearly a joke.With fingers crossed, the old rabbit's foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . . Or are rabbits feet part of international pedo satanic rape cults too? 
<|endoftext|>Oh, good. Sorry that I misunderstood. It is the one piece that I do wish people would drop, or at least de-emphasize.  Many media people would be baffled by these types of emails trotted out as evidence of some heinous crime. (It's the inversion of us older people thinking anything posted on 4chan is from a Russian hacker. It's eye roll inducing and lowers the credibility of anything else said.)
<|endoftext|>There's also another copy pasta sitting in the thread unremoved. 
<|endoftext|>I really kinda consider most of your "work" to be "spam" to be perfectly honest Joey.I see you riding to the top on the fast track with a doc that probably took at least 2 people an hour to put together...1hr in to our round table. And you see Joey, I see a problem there. The math doesn't work. The math *never* works with you guys that come in here with your anti-conspiracy garbage.I would reevaluate my life, my goals, my duty as a human? That is what I would do if I were you. Because we are going to have this here conversation buddy.
<|endoftext|>You guys are too predictable. It's quite hilarious.So much for this sub! Cancel it! Pull it! Proooooof
<|endoftext|>Plus the sick power and cruelty of taking someone's child and their innocence and their future. The power they wield over us deplorables.
<|endoftext|>How about looking at Trump's own words instead of some guy's book? I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.
<|endoftext|>The current republican party hates Trump and consistently makes decisions and moves that further ostracize the chunk of Americans that solidly support Trump. They dragged Bush senior out to make comments about Trump's performance as president and candidate and tried to get Dubya to do the same. Don't forget that Jeb had full establishment backing too. 
<|endoftext|>Senator John DeCamp of Nebraska represented children in court and his book who had specifically accused George Bush Sr of child molestation. There is a lot of interesting evidence and testimony about it, and even more about the cover up that followed. He's just one example. 
<|endoftext|>Part of the reason they're lumped in is Bush's involvement in covering up the case in Omaha Nebraska.
<|endoftext|>Craig Spence hosted parties that provided any kind of sex his guests wanted, including with children. Although he was certainly hiring the services of an adult male prostitution service, he was also a partner of Larry King's pedophile network.
<|endoftext|>Lumping them with pedophile claims is disingenuous and homophobic.The "[How dare you]( method of disrupting a discussion.They were homosexuals liaisons between adults. The Washington Times [reported]( there were "call boys," not adults. The book [The Franklin Scandal]( explains:The Washington Times reported that Spence spent $20,000 a month on prostitutes for himself and his associates, and that he had the juice to arrange midnight tours of the White House for himself, his friends, and the call boys whose services he leased. Paul Bonacci told Yorkshire Television that he was one of the call boys who took a midnight tour, and corroborated that King and Spence were partners in pedophiliac pandering.A June 30, 1989 Washington Times article, Power Broker Served Drugs, Sex At Parties Bugged for Blackmail, revealed that audio and video recording devices were hidden in Spences home, and discussed his penchant for blackmail. A month later another article reported that Spence used sexually compromising photographs taken in his home to blackmail an associate.Spence even told the Washington Times that his home had been bugged by friendly" intelligence agents, and he continually dropped hints to friends and colleagues that he was freelancing for the CIA. The CIA denied this, but the Washington Times confirmed that Spence was a CIA asset. We had sources disclose that Spence wasnt a direct employee, says Rodriguez. But he did carry out services for the agency. 
<|endoftext|>You should watch the documentary *Who Took Johnny?* (on Netflix, elsewhere). It kind of touches on how deep the conspiracy can go through a power structure (local cops up through FBI), and how difficult it is to find victims and witnesses, and to even believe them when they tell their story.The documentary FYI follows the story of one abductee and survivor, from childhood to when he escaped and came forward in adulthood. Some of his initial claims sound insane, unbelievable... but then there are further developments that must be seen to be believed. It may change your mind on things.
<|endoftext|>Not really. Not when they have dirt on everyone or means to create it for the few righteous police or politicians. Or just threaten family or blow up their car - Michael Hastings.
<|endoftext|>130k employees and no leaks: [Manhattan project]( how that works huh
<|endoftext|>But The term "Pizzagate" is derived from the term "pizza" that is frequently found in odd context throughout the Podesta emails, not the comet ping pong connection.
<|endoftext|>Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as kooks, right-wing, liberal, left-wing, terrorists, conspiracy buffs, radicals, militia, racists, religious fanatics, sexual deviates, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.Will you promise to use all of the other [disinformation tactics]( during your AMA? You're doing such a good job demonstrating them here.
<|endoftext|> That person's claims involve them being an adult when sexually harassed. As bad as that might be (given that it's a completely anonymous accusation), it's no where near the accusations of pedophilia, murder, or trafficking.It means that if he has raped a young boy/man like the AMA alleges, then he is obviously more likely to rape/have already raped more young boys/men. Also how is it anonymous if he showed his face? He was verified by the moderators. Furthermore, when people ask for victims, they're not saying to show us victims coming forward. They are asking for evidence that the victims even exist. Were any of the accused behaving strangely right before a child they were involved with disappeared? Was blood found in their freezer? Do people consistently go missing after meeting them? These would be examples of some kind of evidence that the victims even exist.What are you talking about? When people ask for victims, they are absolutely asking for victims to come forward. Evidence that victims even exist? Did the pictures of toddlers with black/purple bags under their eyes (due to sleep deprivation in my opinion) not do it for you? The child chewing on Euros. Actually since you want a bit more evidence than what I've already described, I'll link you a video from 2007. Washington neighborhood commissioner Frank Winstead staged a nighttime surveillance of a Northwest pizza place and put the resulting video up on YouTube -- [In the background of this video, you can hear a young girl **yelling for help**!]( The couple walking by is confusingly turned around by the sound, as it is coming from Comet Ping Pong! It is NOT any of the children walking with the family, it is coming from Comet Ping Pong. It may even be coming from the sewer manhole... It is not a child "horsing around". Frank Winstead had no idea what he captured. He was filming because he had a lot of bones to pick with Comet Ping Pong, one of them being Comet's wish to stay open until 3AM. Frank thought it would attract crime to the area. In 2008, ANC Commissioner Frank Winstead accused the owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis, of "seeking to turn the quiet stretch of Connecticut Avenue in Forest Hills into a haven for rape and murder." During the course of the meeting, Winstead accused Comet owner James Alefantis of lying, cheating, stealing, spitting in a customers food, and encouraging both murderers and rapists.
<|endoftext|>Never heard of this case. Thanks I am going to research it. I hope she is ok.I check new mostly all the time on this sub but for whatever reason never saw this. I do get overwhelmed being a survivor of family abuse as a kid and take several weeks breaks or more. Maybe cut us some slack.
<|endoftext|>It's funny, the people who cry for evidence of victims instantly discredit them when they're found.I've seen people say that Ms. Barrett made everything up. Information warfare is real. 
<|endoftext|> Defending pedophilia is not at all similar to denying unproved, wild fantasies.It is when you accuse other of being guilty of what we're opposed to, and trying to raise awareness of, because people like you would rather sweep it under the rug and allow children to be molested. In fact, I think the biggest proponents of pizzagate are the ones obsessed with kid fucking. Pizzagate is a partisan cult concoction.I wasn't referring to "Pizzagate" which I am equally skeptical of, however doubt the majority here are guilty of what you claim, objectively. It's illogical to assume so, at best. As far as Pizzagate being partisan, there are certainly partisan undertones to it for some, and a number of those who apolitical who subscribe to the theory. I'm more inclined to expose *actual* pedophiles in the hope that they are brought to justice. See my post above for perspective: 
<|endoftext|>You have a tendency to show up in every single pedophilia conspiracy thread and attempt to derail conversations. 
<|endoftext|>In fact, I think the biggest proponents of pizzagate are the ones obsessed with kid fucking. Pizzagate is a partisan cult concoction. Boom! 2 for 2 for y'all playing bingo at home ;)I hope we hit an alt-right, or maybe even a drumpf - I need this! 
<|endoftext|>Where did you hear that?Thw indictment doesn't mention minors.
<|endoftext|>Well, no. I was just curious if you knew the ages involved. I haven't followed that story closely. 
<|endoftext|>How am I shutting down discussions? I've been having discussions about pizzagate for months, in this thread alone I have dozens of comments. Your name has its roots in the Greek, Yoke-Finger. My name is a reference to a piece of pizzagate "evidence" ie a bar in Washington called l'enfant. are fun aren't they? 
<|endoftext|>Obviously there are rings in DC but I just dont think Comet Ping Pong has anything to do with or Podesta for that matter. Theres no solid evidence.
<|endoftext|>Look at my last comment. You nailed it. It's become super easy to spot shills about this topic. A MAN SHOT UP THAT PIZZA SHOP SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED (doesn't mention photos of Alefantis with the DC police commissioner, doesn't mention the cameras facing the building were pointed a different direction the day of the shooting, doesn't mention the one bullet shot destroyed the hardrive of the computer in the store, doesn't mention the shooter was a fucking actor)
<|endoftext|>Yes! I 100% agree, this is why I hate the branding effect of the name pizzagate. It was so effective! 
<|endoftext|>It was sent by Susan Sandler, of the Sandler Foundation (major donor to the DNC). Her exact phrasing was "The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus (sic)? They can send it if you want."Absolutely bizarre, yet no one has ever asked Podesta to explain it, nor any of the other questionable emails.
<|endoftext|>Some people absolutely do have scripts running and alerting them of topics talking about different keywords to then try and derail said discussionI see a couple familiar faces already
<|endoftext|>I am not part of "they" you refer to. More like my account is a generally well sourced series of comments countering claims related to pizzagate.I make no judgement on "pedogate" which came after pizzagate and tried to associate the fake pizzagate story with real child abuse cases. 
<|endoftext|>Let's let the thread play out and try to stay focused on the data. This thread isn't going to change anyone's mind so folks should rehash the data, stay civil and agree to disagree.
<|endoftext|>Sure! Check out these links presented. All factual information.James calls his friend (holding a baby) a chicken lover anyone claiming PG is debunked because "no basement" : if you can complete these simple steps to debunk pizzagate! Tony's weird art collection: into consideration he calls Dennis Hastert (serial child RAPIST) a good friend.Podesta also has a large subterranean vault under his house, and in Wikileaks dumps, he speaks of a "torture chamber".  this is just a small amount of circumstantial evidence compared to the mountains of creepy shit online.And I didnt't even touch on the Epstein/Prince Andrew/Bill Clinton/Trump connection.
<|endoftext|>This is simply further evidence that Pizzagate is a political witch-hunt. Podesta *received a forwarded email* and it's used as evidence that Podesta is a pedophile. An email that, quite frankly, reads like it's mocking the situating "Denny" is in. Podesta doesn't even bother to respond.Mike Pence actually goes out of his way to [defend the same pedophile]( after he deliberately mishandled another sexual abuse scandal involving teenagers. And we get *crickets*.
<|endoftext|>You can certainly be forgiven for the misunderstanding because ShareBlue (most likely) repeated the misleading claim hundreds or thousands of times.
<|endoftext|>nothing wierd about James Alefantis visitng the white house the day before and the day after sandy hook... Nothing weird about a pizza shop owner being listed as one of the 40 most powerful people in washington DC. Nothing weird with his connections to the Rothschilds...Yeah sure guy. The dude a kingpin. 
<|endoftext|>Quite the bold claim there. You have been able to disprove every pizzagate claim? Please share, I am sure the thread would love to see it.
<|endoftext|>You can look at other comments or you can hit key words on a search engine and see where it takes you. Happy Hunting. This guy does not use Sacred Geometry or numbers from what I can see.
<|endoftext|>wow...I have stayed off the conspiracy reddit thread for awhile. I used these theories to make myself feel better about my own sins and avoid thinking too much about my past. I am 32 months sober now. My life is much different now...I am not filled with secrets anymore and I do have integrity and do not live in fear of what I am.Yes this Aviccii thing looks like murder to me. I don't feel empowered to fix it. I do want to be a force for good. Please help me universe/god/whatever force it is that helped push me come into the light 32 months ago.
<|endoftext|>Why are you asking John? It was Susan Sandler who referred to a "map that seems pizza related".And going by the code "Cheese pizza = child pornography" Susan's email becomesmap that seems pornography relatedWhich doesn't make much sense.It was Kathryn Tate in the email who first mentioned the handkerchief. Is she the ring leader of this pedo cult or just a real estate agent? 
<|endoftext|>Or the strange occult ritual where they cut their left middle finger whilst drawing symbols on their hands. Seriously look it up. John podesta eat the pain. Most are photoshopped but the one where his hands are up and hes in an office is not doctored. 
<|endoftext|>Within the first hour as well. As if they wanted to make it as obvious as possible. They're drawn to the word "pizzagate" like moths to a flame. 
<|endoftext|>it isnt randomizing things. In contest mode it isnt the votes of the comments its who spams the most... which is even more annoying.
<|endoftext|>"Appeal to reputation" is not how a system of accountability works. Rules apply universally. A [Bill of Attainder]( is not legal for a reason.
<|endoftext|>Hey... its me Ryan. Nothing was fabricated. Yes i sold shirts. I also refunded everybody who bought a shirt when the shills shit their pants over it. Focus of shirts was spreading awareness. 100% of the marketing of pizzagate was controlled by MSM. I wanted to change that. Even if my motivation was to make money... it still happened. Pegasus is real. The threats are real. The info in the video is real. His reaction was real. The police report is real. The special agent i dealt with was real.
<|endoftext|>Are you claiming that Ryan fabricated evidence against Alefantis, and filed a false report to the police (a report they acknowledged as legitimate), all as an elaborate ruse to sell more shirts? That doesn't sound very plausible to me.Right, because people never do things for money. /sHe wasn't only selling t-shirts. He was begging for donations on his channel and he had a Patreon.Although, it's really funny that you talk about plausibility when discussing pizzagate of all things. His videos are about taking a "killroom" hashtag on instagram as evidence of a literal murder. The replies on the picture also include a comment about werewolves, so I guess they're literally talking about man-beasts that roam the earth! /s Yet, in your mind, Ryan finding a "killroom" without evidence of the actual "kill" and then getting threatened by the murderer and warnings from the FBI is more plausible than him trying to take advantage of gullible people? Ok.Sounds like it would be highly illegal and dangerous move to fabricate evidence against the 49th most powerful person in Washington D.C. Oh come on, do you believe everything you read in GQ? There were party planners ahead of him on that list for crying out loud lol. What kind of "power" do you think these people have? He was dating David Brock at the time, which would have put him on the radar for a magazine of GQ's caliber...Regardless, if JA is so "powerful" why did Ryan continue posting Pizzagate nonsense (after a short break) on his channel and selling pizzagate merchandise on his site? If you were threatened by such a "powerful" foe, would you also do the same? Either he didn't take the threat (from a man he's accusing of murder) or the warning from the FBI seriously, or the "threat" and talks with the FBI were simply fabricated.f this is all a stunt as you claim, then why hasn't Ryan been arrested after filing the false report?Because, short of a confession, it's virtually impossible to prove. The police aren't going to waste resources putting an investigator on a fruitless effort. It was a pretty low risk move. A move that he didn't make until *hours after* he recorded, edited, and uploaded his youtube video (almost as if he wasn't going to report it until people started asking for evidence). We also don't know exactly what he told the police.But, again, forgetting that, if he was really threatened and reported those threats to the police, why didn't he ever record *any* of these interactions? Not just JA, but he could have called back the police and recorded himself asking questions or giving details/evidence about his report. He could have recorded the FBI telling him not to "poke the bear" (a point which you completely ignore). If any of his claims were true, he's had ample time to prove them. But, let's be real here. If *you* were threatened by a "powerful" man that you are accusing of *murder* and the fucking *FBI* told you to back off, would you continue hocking PG merch and vlogging about it?
<|endoftext|>Just look at his Instagram...
<|endoftext|> a bit skeptical of your intentions, and your apparent lack of information as to what happened between Ryan and James.Ryan filed an actual police report and James was confronted by law enforcement. This actually happened dude. I see people smearing Ryan all the time, probably out of desperation to cover up that loose end. Alefantis threatening an actual online researcher is a very damning piece of evidence.
<|endoftext|> The Facebook chat was faked. The guy that started the rumour runs www.pizzagategear.com and is trying to make money off it. This sounds like more of an opinion of yours, than fact. Do you have any actual evidence to support this claim? I understand Ryan runs Pizzagategear.com, I've spoken with him on a few occasions, but he stands by his story. You're saying he fabricated this entire event, as a charade to sell more shirts? Last I spoke to him, he never mentioned anything about being in trouble for filing a false police report. The phone records likely show a conversation between the two, as well, and law enforcement likely confirmed this.Did Ryan confess to faking the IM conversation, or is that just your "nothing to see here, move along" "Jedi wave" attempt to deter others from taking this piece of evidence legitimately?Thanks for posting the police reports also. To provide context to readers, this entire thing started after Ryan shared the "Pegasus Museum" video on Voat.co/v/pizzagate

But that's only part of it. Why would anyone launder money unless they were selling something illegal. But "drugs" just didn't fit the bill. 
<|endoftext|>That's the kind of red pill we want to see at the top of this thread, not a debunk. The debunks are fine, just not as the authoritative *top comment* for an entire round table discussion. You do know how top comments can be authoritative right?
<|endoftext|>Would you say the same thing about [this post]( which has an even greater amount of links aggregated, posted at a similar time?Whats wrong with providing context to a statement that has been, when stripped of context, made out to be part of pedo code but makes sense with the context? and I still dont understand what rule I broke? can mods remove comments without citing a rule? /u/axolotl_peyotl, youd know better than me, is this allowed?

In the gay community (though it's not exclusive to us), we often use the word "boy" to describe adults, usually under 25.

As for Trump, I consider him a fraud, a charlatan, a troll, and puppet, a puppet of Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Ag, the global elite, and the very "deep state" or military-industrial complex he selectively pretends to be at odds with for the sake of political theater and foremost political gain.
<|endoftext|>Count one: Sex Traficking Jane doe 1 & 2[18 U.S. Code  1591 - Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion](
<|endoftext|>Raniere has a history of inappropriate relationships with 12-15 yo in the 80s wouldnt surprise me that was still the case
<|endoftext|>Yeah, I think it's the dark triad, which is both. Psychopaths are often narcissistic, but narcissists may not be psychopathic, which is why I made the distinction. But we're on the same page.
<|endoftext|>I didn't say they did. I'm saying that the MSM cherry picked information from across the broad spectrum of theories that fall under "pizzagate" to erect a straw man which they could "debunk" for the cameras, despite not actually addressing the vast majority of information available which lead pizzagate theorists to their respective conclusions.
<|endoftext|>Ah mate! I remember on the subreddit the day before the "shooting" that guy from DC who posted about the traffic camera facing the other way, and then the next day - what do ya know! A shooting occurs. To everyone who saw that post beforehand the false flag was obvious. And like you mentioned, he only shot one bullet and it went straight into the computer tower (note: just in the interest of being specific, we don't actually *know* that it hit the hard drive. It was reported that it hit the computer tower in the back office, but what specific components got hit was never made public). 
<|endoftext|>The traffic camera never pointed at Comet Ping Pong in the first place, it pointed at the intersection, so it's irrelevant that it may have been off position. [Welch fired several shots in the pizzeria]( and calling him an actor is a stretch  he played "raver/victim" in one trashy film (ie, he was an extra, not an actor).
<|endoftext|>I know about Tony Podestas art. How does it make him a pedophile?How does Tony owning art which he displays in his home indicate James Alefantis is part of a child abuse ring? 
<|endoftext|>Why does Podesta have to explain Susan Sandlers choice of words?I suggest the email isn't bizarre. Replace handkerchief with mobile phone or keyring for example. 
<|endoftext|>I know I just think mods shouldn't be calling out users that way. It just adds to the noise already present for people like me who get called a shill constantly because we don't toe the line.
<|endoftext|>It's a discussion. There should be representation from multiple sides of the topic.Keep the topic on the content and not the faces please. As not to be a complete hypocrite, my comment to JLE was sincere though I could have worded it differently.
<|endoftext|>Thanks. Ok, the first one :James calls his friend (holding a baby) a chicken hawk.  wrong.James doesn't call anyone a chicken hawk. He uses the hashtag chickenlovers as a comment on a public Instagram post. To me it suggests both of them love chicken and [the baby may even be chewing on a piece in the photo.]( does a photo of a friend holding a baby with the hashtag "chickenlovers" indicate the activity of a pedophile and why would a pedophile post their pedophile proclivities in public? 
<|endoftext|>Well this IS the right thread for it so go ahead. Pick one and we'll see how quickly I can make a fool of myself.QIEK EEDITZ: Although understand that saying *"These pictures are weird"* isn't something that can be disproved. You'd need to show how weird pics prove human sex trafficking. 
<|endoftext|>Yeah, just google 'pizza handkerchief' and you'll find tons of examples of literally pizza\-themed hankerchiefs. Seeing as John is such a fan of italian cuisine, it would make sense that he had a pizza handkerchiefThose 'coded' e\-mails are the weakest part of the pizzagate 'evidence'. IMO we all do ourselves a disservice when we hold up easily\-defeated 'code' words as the biggest evidence of something sinister, when there's more questionable things that never get brought up.
<|endoftext|>I just want to know what it means. It's obviously not literal. However, there have been several theories about what is meant by map. I don't know. By the way, you are arguing with a false dichotomy, which is a type of strawman argument. This person can be both a real estate agent and complicit in illicit activity without being a ringleader of anything.
<|endoftext|>You'd ask John cause he would be expected to know it.Also, you have a suspiciously consistent number of upvotes on your comments. 
<|endoftext|>What exactly happened? There was really a troll comment with 100+ upvotes before this thread got put into contest mode? What did they say?
<|endoftext|>This is what I've been trying to tell them, you and I have spoke before. You may want to paste this comment in the other threads on this topic where I brought you up. Thanks for clarifying. 
<|endoftext|>You're full of shit.Are you proud of who you have become? I would be fucking embarrassed and ashamed. 
<|endoftext|>They renamed prostitution "sex trafficking" so in that sense it does exist, but there are no "sex slaves" in the U.S.
<|endoftext|>I also tried to follow the link in that image and there is nothing there.Edit: Never mind, searched by case number and found it. Still no information aside from the complaintant, and he didnt even sign it which seems odd.
<|endoftext|>Look dude, just because somebody points something out you dont like doesnt mean they have an "agenda". Get a grip.Anyway, i dont get what that picture is supposed to show. Alefantis' name is nowhere on it, all it shows is that this Ryan guy complained to the police about somebody making terroristic threats. Is there anything that actually shows that police confronted Alefantis about the supposed text message conversation?
<|endoftext|>Read the chat. It's clearly bullshit.Why doesn't Ryan sue Alefantis if this really happened? Why does the police report make no mention of Alefantis?The voat stuff is likely will craddock of Disobedient Media selling more bullshit. I don't know if they work in concert or just happen to be in parallel. 
<|endoftext|>Why would you not want to see a debunk at the top of a round table discussion? Do you just want to speculate wildly with no regard for alternate viewpoints?
<|endoftext|>I don't agree with the removal of your comment, and not entirely with the comment itself either. Regardless, your comment appears to have been re-approved since. Though it's worth noting, if all or the majority your posts to a given forum or subreddit are entirely or nearly entirely in opposition of said forum or subreddit, it shouldn't be surprising you would receive greater scrutiny as a result. I'm not saying that's right, just the way nearly every forum and sub operates, more or less. I try to be as impartial as humanly possible, personally, when I moderate, and understand that's not as easy for most others to do instinctually. Perhaps the worst examples of biased moderation are /r/worldnews, /r/politics, and /r/The_Donald, where users are routinely banned without reason simply for having an unpopular opinion, or because the mods personally disagree with the user's point of view, in spite of no rule violation being present.
<|endoftext|>I think it's more so the fact that we don't really need the top comment in a thread (especially a stickied round table thread) to be a debunk of some kind. I don't mind the debunks and if it's about what I think it is then you're probably right, but the problem is when your debunk shoots to the top (seems fishy, mostly TMOR would up vote something like this for trolling/brigading purposes) and makes the rest of the thread less attractive by nature. It's called forum sliding, whether intentional or not. Maybe just repost the debunk now that it's not going to be the top comment.
<|endoftext|>To me it looked like you had that comment ready to go for this thread or whenever someone asked about PizzaGate. You've copy-pasted before and it seems unnecessary. Copy-pasting comments as a reply to a comment or thread makes what you have to say look less genuine.
<|endoftext|>You come here in bad faith. You poison threads. You interfere with people's ability to learn and decide for themselves. I'm sick to death of banning all you and your buddies' sock puppets. I want you to leave of your own accord. You don't contribute. You poison. Think about it. 
<|endoftext|>Lol I've seen the videos, and they ARE gross...he said there was something scary about posting them...I assumed he meant dealing with shills, but that's not that scary to me. Eat shit
<|endoftext|>So you're saying that budget constraints caused them to lose 98% of children taken from their families?
<|endoftext|>Fuck which president did it man. This 2 party system is the biggest smoke screen hindering us from banning together against our oppressive govt. 
<|endoftext|>Are there any contemporary accounts of the incident? I couldn't find anything other than third-hand accounts after Epstein was already in trouble. James Patterson wrote this like a decade after Epstein's accusers went public and he doesn't cite any sources. The closest I could find was this [article]( written when Epstein was already in some deep shit and it doesn't mention Trump at all (Epstein denied it, by the way).Regardless, I'm not sure how much this account, if true, helps Trump. It means he was good friends with the guy for decades before another "wealthy" man made a big deal about. Sounds more like Epstein simply picked the wrong girl. The worst is they didn't even file a complaint with any authorities. Doesn't exactly make Trump look like the good guy here.I can't say this story is fabricated, but I think it's fair to say that had this information been about Podesta, pizzagate proponents would probably not brush it off as readily.
<|endoftext|>So Trump knew Epstein for 15+ years and partied with Epstein and knew that Epstein fucked younger girls but was totally oblivious to them being <18? Sorry Charlie, but that doesn't pass the smell test.Oh and then there's [this]( of course.
<|endoftext|>They tried until they received public backlash. Obama care? Tax cuts? The wall? They thought America voted in the Republican party. They got on their high horse which the public quickly bucked them off. We voted Trump. Republican party is just a usefull tool at this point and they know it. 
<|endoftext|>Not that weird. The Kelly girls thing is so sick. Trying to get a copy of one autobiography of a woman who was victim to Bob Hope and loaned out to Kissinger and Bush she says. Nightmares reading such things but we owe her courage as many witnesses as we can.I also got Moira Greyland's new book. So horrid to see the Sci fi/fantasy authors of the 80s and 90s had such an evil rot within and a "feminist" author abusing her daughter and children. Sick sick sick
<|endoftext|> the Backstreet Boys contained only adults.That is completely untrue. The youngest member was 13, the oldest 22. 
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the link but that doesn't prove the ages you claimed.The statute is "18 U.S. Code  1591 - Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion"This statute covers sex trafficking of children AND adults.Mack has been charged under the clause which may or may not include children as I'm reading it. Do you have any articles which describes the ages of Jane Doe 1 & 2? Particularly the one which describes them as 12 year olds? 
<|endoftext|>Yes, that is how they do it, it is on the FBI website for codes. The artwork and designs are notifications of what they are selling.
<|endoftext|>You are correct. We were "told" that's where the bullet hit....which is still kinda sloppy. But shills will say "OMG HE COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE!" yeah so could the shitty driver I was behind earlier this morning. 
<|endoftext|>Okay, think advertising for something illegal. You want to get the word out and your IQ is over 115. You still want to look like a great citizen who is just smart? On top of that, Art Museums get HUGE tax relief and it is easy for money laundering AND it is used to advertise they're specific fetishes, while making YOU The unaware feel like you don't understand specific tastes and undermine your inability to understand the psychopathic mind.
<|endoftext|>Because he has been widely implicated in a political pedophile/trafficking ring and accused of using pedophile codewords. If you were accused of such a thing and could easily explain yourself, why wouldn't you?If you replaced handkerchief with keyring or mobile phone it would still be strange.Who emails someone to tell them they left a hanky behind and do they want it returned? What is a pizza related map and why was it on the handkerchief? Why is this mentioned in the email as if it is significant?
<|endoftext|>Did they claim he was a shill or did they merely point out the unusual account activity that is common with forum manipulators that get pings when certain keywords are used?Are you now claiming that shills dont exist at all? 
<|endoftext|>I said I was being sincere. I think my comments reflect that.I think he provides uniquely detailed responses and they should be considerations in this thread.
<|endoftext|>I'm all for having 2 sidesIt does get tiring when one side refuses to look at evidence themselves and just go back to "it's debunked" or "it's crazy"These people should fuck right off the sub imo as they are not contributing a meaningful end of the discussionAnd my comment wasn't directed at JLE at all lol, more in a general sense in reply to bignuke
<|endoftext|>Does nobody here remember the monologue from Heavy Breathing in the CPP "back area" for the excited crowd in which someone yell "He likes little boys!" And the HB MC replies sinisterly, " well we all have our preferences...heh heh heh" You bitches want to act like everything was pulled out an ass and construed. They took down Alefantes' Instagram for a reason - IT WAS DISGUSTING and nearly every post andComment was questionable. If it wasn't don't you think he would have left it up as proof of his innocent and family oriented restaurant purity? Not sure if you people can still pull up a complete archived version of the CPP/Alefantis Instagram - probably not. But if you never saw it in the first place I'm not sure how you can argue with me in ignorance.
<|endoftext|>not sayin lockin him away just yet. Just saying don't write it off as nothing if you can read the writing on the walls, this guy is a criminal.  
<|endoftext|>You're the one who made the claim that pizzagate is complete fiction and now you want me to do the legwork for you in building and structuring your argument. Hard pass.I'm not saying pizzagate is confirmed real. I am very aware that the evidence for it is all circumstantial. Saying "there are other explanations for this or that" is all fine and good, and imo necessary, but it is not *disproving* something. Political figures around the world have been involved in human trafficking/pedophile rings before, and been involved in the coverups. I don't understand why the mere idea that there might be a pedophile ring in the US involving some politicians is so outrageous to some people.
<|endoftext|>See the thing is when a case like that is settled in court or outside of court, there is usually a clause which seals the evidence. You know how it works.Was Dylan sexually assaulted by James in the Comet Pizza kitchen? I will possibly never know unless I ask Carole or Dylan in person. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Events seem to suggest that something did happen, like Carole leaving behind both restaurants she made popular (Bucks and Comet) due to "pressing family matters".Some researchers have got very close to the kind of smoking gun evidence that would make you happy, why not continue where they left off? Just imagine, you could debunk this once and for all and be a hero!
<|endoftext|>Like Tony Podesta's friendship with known pedo Dennis Hastert, and the tube they spent together in a part of Japan known for underage relations. 
<|endoftext|>I think it's just literal.I didn't mean to set up a straw man, I'm trying to find out the logic that goes from real estate agent finding a handkerchief, that handkerchief being described to John by Susan, John replying it's not a big deal and Susan replying ok thanks - is a sign of a pedophile network talking in code. 
<|endoftext|>16 vs 13 is consistent? That's just the 2 above this one.Anyway, why does John have to explain Susan's choice of words?He said "it's mine but not worth worrying about" what do you suppose he meant? 
<|endoftext|>Just read through that, didnt really debunk anything just tried to make it seem like a coincidence. Theres a plethora of bizarre emails that super elites were sending to each other regarding pizza walnut sauce red daisy that just dont make sense for high value people to be emailing about. Or that Obama ordered $65,000 worth of hot dogs to the White House. It just doesnt add up. People dont like pizza THAT much. A normal presidential food security check comes out to be around $2,000 for radiation and poison scanning. The value of a Child from a third world nation on the silkroad, which wouldve been active around the time of the emails, was in the range of $40,000-$120,000. NO ONE buys $50,000 Pizzas and NO toxin checkpoint costs $65,000+.
<|endoftext|>You're "telling" me "he's not like that," which shows me that you think I'll trust anyone based on your word. That's the essence of how propaganda works.
<|endoftext|>My bad, but the link gives some more credibility to your statement to the deniers. I dont understand how anyone could view those posts without feeling a little sick. 
<|endoftext|>Have you missed this recent case? are you honestly saying that adults and children aren't ever literally *forced* into "prostitution"? 
<|endoftext|> Is there anything that actually shows that police confronted Alefantis about the supposed text message conversation?There definitely isn't any evidence:* His only proof was screenshots.* He claimed he ["tried"]( to record their conversations *twice*. One of the times he had a "buddy" next to him and neither of them thought to at least video-record the conversation. The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call, but Ryan still doesn't record the conversation (despite having allegedly been threatened before).* He claimed to have reported Alefantis to the FBI and that they told him not to ["poke the bear"]( Yet, he continued to [talk about PG]( and [selling pizzagate merchandise]( for like a year afterwards. * If the FBI really looked into it, why haven't they found anything? Why didn't he ever provide evidence of the report? * If the FBI is "in on it" and/or he were really threatened by Alefantis, why would he continue to sell pizzagate merchandise and vlogging about pizzagate?   It doesn't look like he took the threat very seriously.
<|endoftext|>So nothing short of a confession from James himself, can convince you that Ryan is telling the truth? Why would he file a fake police report?If he's faking this thing, then James could sue him for slander or fabrication, correct? Then why hasn't he? My guess is because Ryan's story is true, and that James doesn't want this incident \*anywhere\* near a courtroom, especially with the circumstantial evidence against him in PG circulating.Would a full written elaboration on the incident help? My job isn't to convince you, but I hope you can see there's clearly something strange going on here.[ for providing me with the opportunity to present this piece of the puzzle to the readers.
<|endoftext|> It's clearly bullshit.No, it isn't, and everything points to Ryan's story being true. I understand you are passionate about discrediting the Pizzagate scandal, but it's going to take more than just your opinion to "debunk" this. 
<|endoftext|>Didn't I just explain that? Top comment is the representative for the entire thread. It's just the way Reddit works because it's a linear forum. We don't need a debunk representing the entire thread, it doesn't make sense and doesn't promote discussion or debate.I actually agree with the debunk, but I don't think it should be the top comment because it creates a false consensus that "this conversation is over" or "everyone thinks this is BS so I shouldn't read further", when in fact it is a complex topic with several avenues of discussion and tons of loose ends still.And because TMOR is behind the up voting on it, and also stirring up drama to distract from the conversation, their activities in this sub should be nullified by any means. They are deliberately trying to make conspiracy research look misguided and irresponsible.
<|endoftext|>The sidebar says this sub is for discussion. Presenting an argument and debunking it are both part of a discussion. That's why even mods here spend time/energy debunking conspiracy theories (e.g. Russia-Trump related ones).
<|endoftext|>His comment was removed for spam, not forum sliding/brigading. So according to the mods, posting the full extent of the Podesta emails is now spam. Make of that what you will.
<|endoftext|>My comment itself was relevant to PizzaGate, I used the Podesta emails to show how the dominoes on pasta email makes sense with context. Its relevant to the topic at hand, yeah? Id posted it before, but I posted it here because I thought it would add to the discussion. Its a collection of primary sources, its not like theres anything to rephrase. I wasnt really trying to say anything with my own voice, per se, I just compiled some of the emails to tell their own story
<|endoftext|>Wow, really?Podesta(Pizzagate) is in the title, how does posting his emails in full not contribute? If I honestly don't believe Podesta rapes kids am I not allowed to discuss?
<|endoftext|>Rich people know reporting each other to the authorities doesn't do anything. Getting wrongdoers or "wrongdoers" into the news, now, that's different.
<|endoftext|>BTW in Mitch McConnel's first meeting with Trump he said I don't want to hear anymore talk of draining the swamp. Mitch will be going done, just like Ryan. Either by his own hand or ours. 
<|endoftext|>I'm not sure what the "original report" would be, let alone where to find it. I think the guy I linked was replying to someone who uploaded some documents or something. Or you can submit a FOIA request, like they did. But I'm not sure what a report like this would say. I don't think there's much meaningful information that can be recorded (other than the allegations) when there's no witnesses of a crime (or victims).Generally speaking, police investigate crimes, not people. It can get really murky, civil rights-wise, if police go around shaking people down for little/no reason. Without evidence of a crime, like a witness or a crime scene to pin on a suspect, there's not much for them to go on.I've suggested in the past that pizzagaters hire a personal investigator, but I've never seen anything come of it. However, after researching the evidence/accusations myself, I'm not even sure any investigator would take the job (since I don't think the clients would be too happy with the results). The "evidence" Pizzagaters are going on basically boils down to accusations and speculation, mixed in with a hefty dose of lies/misleading information. And anybody who disagrees with them opens themselves up to personally targeted attacks, which I see happen all the time.
<|endoftext|>You know after reading your comment again, and your comment history, I think you're right. My apologies.
<|endoftext|>because it's continually brought up after certain users make unfounded claims about the victims' ages of Allison Mack, who is not Raniere. It muddies the waters. Hope that answers your question, as it's not strange to down vote incorrect content based on context. It's sane even.
<|endoftext|>I know it's not conclusive, but you sometimes gotta trust your instincts. Literally the first time I saw a picture of John Podesta the first thought that popped in my head was "looks like a pedophile"
<|endoftext|> it is on the FBI website for codesThe symbols are from the FBI. The codewords did *not* come from the FBI, but instead came from 4chan which isn't reliable. 
<|endoftext|>That's fine, he doesn't have to. I think I articulated my point as clearly as I could. And getting the information out there is all that matters. 
<|endoftext|>Why do they "want to get the word out"? You've already said they're all emailing and Instagraming each other. It just doesn't make sense. 
<|endoftext|>But as you just said Podesta didn't use the alleged code, it was Susan.Because he has been widely implicated in a political pedophile/trafficking ring and accused of using pedophile codewords. So where is the evidence he has to answer? If there is evidence of a crime he should absolutely be held accountable If you were accused of such a thing and could easily explain yourself, why wouldn't you?Because acknowledging such ridiculous claims can only be damaging. If you replaced handkerchief with keyring or mobile phone it would still be strange.I don't agree. Who emails someone to tell them they left a hanky behind and do they want it returned? What is a pizza related map and why was it on the handkerchief? Why is this mentioned in the email as if it is significant?As you said Susan Sandler emailed him to tell him about the handkerchief. Although actually it was Kathryn Tate the realtor who first mentioned the handkerchief. Because she is in the business of selling homes and wants to return property to people viewing her homes for sale - like a professional.If we assume you are correct, what role do Kathryn Tate and Susan Sandler play? Why are they sending plain text emails about pillows and kitchen islands and real estate mixed with pedophile code? 
<|endoftext|>I'm just trying to highlight how flimsy the alleged code theory is - It wasn't written by Podesta.We don't know if the person who wrote it is a pedophile.We don't know if it's encoded.These points alone are enough to cast doubt on the entire theory imo.And thank you for replying, I don't mean to be combative. 
<|endoftext|>I find the worst shills are the silly folks that hide in private subreddits debating whether other users are shills to the point that they dig up information on those folks then cutely refer to it later when they come out of their little private enclave and think they discovered some big revelation and giddily throw it around like they're in 3rd grade show and tell.Those folks are actually the biggest hypocrites too.
<|endoftext|>I missed that sorry. I appreciate that. FTR I think you folks do a good job modding overall, I just wish this sub could get over the idea that folks that don't agree with them are shills.
<|endoftext|>I don't comment on many threads, though I read many threads. There are a few topics I have dug into over the years that I do comment on. Probably because those are topics I imagine I know a little about. I suspect JaimeLesEnfants behaves similarly. So, not terribly weird at all. Just human nature.
<|endoftext|>As I mentioned in another comment, this thread isn't going to change anyone's mind so folks should just rehash the data, stay civil and agree to disagree.
<|endoftext|>From my perspective, the exact same thing could be said for the other side as well. Do you find that tiring as well? Personally, as long as one side keeps rehashing the same points, I am all for the other side providing the same rebuttals. But that is just me.
<|endoftext|>my statement stands on its own. So not really. edit: when sharks sense chum in the water they feed meaning any forum slide opportunity sensed by a potential troll could be easily taken advantage of here.
<|endoftext|> god]( 
<|endoftext|>You're the one who made the claim that pizzagate is complete fiction and now you want me to do the legwork for you in building and structuring your argument. Hard pass.That's how the burden of proof works. I don't understand why the mere idea that there might be a pedophile ring in the US involving some politicians is so outrageous to some people.Because the nonsense of Pizzagate wants to adopt other cases of proven pedophilia under its own umbrella of nothingness. 
<|endoftext|> be time for Denny to vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island"Podesta hasn't talked about this email or the torture chamber email once. Why not? Disregard ALL the pizza emails, there are very questionable statements in the POdesta leaks that have nothing to do w/ pizza
<|endoftext|> If he's faking this thing, than James could sue him for slander or fabrication, correct?Anybody can sue anybody for anything. That doesn't mean they would win. He would have to prove that not only was Ryan lying, but also that JA was hurt by those lies. Not an easy thing to do.All Ryan would have to say is: "I thought it was him, although it could have been a troll." There would be virtually no way to win this kind of case (I challenge you to find a successful similar case of slander/libel). No lawyer would encourage such a waste of resources.Not to mention that a lot of people are aware of ["The Streisand Effect"]( and would rather avoid drawing attention to a case they probably couldn't win.Regardless, Ryan's story simply doesn't add up:
<|endoftext|>Was Alefantis ever actually charged with anything? Is there any evidence at all that police ever approached him about the complaint? Is there a court date pending? Did Ryan drop the charges? What's the resolution to this and how does it prove Ryan's accusation?Also, the reason as to "why" he would make it up is obvious; is/was his YouTube channel monitized or not? Also, what would Alefantis have to gain by suing for libel aside from people like you just seeing that as more "evidence" of trying to cover something up?
<|endoftext|>I'd love to see some evidence pizzagate was real, there just isn't any.I won't be silenced for disagreeing with you, and others. 
<|endoftext|>You're just interpreting things incorrectly. Forum sliding can be considered spam. I'm not even suggesting that was his intent, but it is what happened, so it should be cleaned up to promote discussion. Otherwise half the people will jump into this thread, see the top comment is a debunk, and become disinterested in the rest of the thread.
<|endoftext|>The stats are in! No post history here in 5 months....hmmmHow long do we ignore what is going on?Real users of this sub...are you sick of this?
<|endoftext|>No, by all means, dispute the info. All Joey does though, is very carefully shit on all conspiracy topics. With *miraculous* amounts of votes taking him right to the top. It is synthetic consensus. I actually think it is dangerous for me to poke someone like him this hard. I have probably banned 5 or 10 of his alts(conservative estimate) over the last couple years. I'm actually tagging you right now to track on if you are one of his sock puppets. No offense. Just some unknown account poking a mod when he is so obviously out of fucks doesn't make a ton of sense.I'm not at a PC, I can't really look, how many comments have you made in this sub before now?
<|endoftext|>From your lips to God's ears. Lots of Congress needs to go. Start with the 44ish Dems the #Awanbrothers traded Intel to Pakistan on/with and Ryan, Gowdy - first gotta remove his head stuck up Mueller's ass, Mitch McConnell etc etc. I hate to be that person but God seems to have taken cars of Songbird McCain.Oh and the Dem who sent Pizzagate investigating Scalise's staff pizzas the day he got shot by Sanders loving child abuser sigh a " mean looking assault weapon". I need to remember his name because that is one disgusting move
<|endoftext|>There is nothing incorrect about the fact and Reneir is also indited on the same case. Him sleeping with children in the past is definitely a correlation worth mentioning.
<|endoftext|>Podesta didn't use those words at all, it was a woman called Susan. do you think she means? Why does her use of "pizza related" indicate Podesta is a pedophile?What do you make of this part of the emailHere are links to the houses we drove by today located in Vineyard Haven. 1 House at the end of the road to Lake Tashmoo at Kuffie's Point...Thanks for all piling into the car. It definitely was more fun with everyone and think of all the gossip you would have missed if we were in two cars. Let us know if you have any other questions about any of the houses.
<|endoftext|>Youre avoiding the question that paid forum manipulators exist, and are present on most conspiracy forums, as well as corporate shills who shill products on major social media platforms, including reddit.  you that ignorant or just trolling? Im honestly not sure anymore. 
<|endoftext|>Hopefully someone will address the substance of my comment rather than debate around it and imply I'm a shill.As yet I have had no substantive replies! 
<|endoftext|>Okay bruh bruh, I'm looking at your comment replies on this thread, and you've clearly got some sort of agenda here, so I won't bother arguing with someone that doesn't want to actually have a conversation or be convinced of anything.But, just to your reply: why do all of the #chickenlover tags have chickens in them? Why does James' only have a little kid and no chicken?OOOOOOOP! Maybe #chickenlover means different things to different people, huh?
<|endoftext|>He was friends with the guy and he was about to be tried for paying off abuse victims.Although the statement isn't a negative comment against Hastert it is hardly an endorsement of his behaviour in the 1970s.Regardless, how does a tongue in cheek commet about dissappearing make John a pedophile? John wasn't coaching the wrestling team with Hastert and once again it wasn't John who made the alleged incriminating comment. But the person who did wasn't Hillarys campaign manager so that's not worth mentioning is it? 
<|endoftext|>Start reading the emails, youll find the same shit that I found. Or look into the JFK files and open your mind. Otherwise consider to shut people up or realize our world truly is run by sick sick elites. 
<|endoftext|>I'd seen it before, but didn't really think it was relevant to my points. I have noted in my other comment though that the timestamp of the report proves he reported it after uploading his video.I guess vlogging on youtube is more important than threats from a man he's accusing of murder. Funny how nothing ever came of the report. His local PD must be in on it, too, and they're defending the child rapist thousands of miles away! /s
<|endoftext|>I'd love to see some evidence pizzagate was realWhy? Most of us here wish this wasn't real. Unfortunately, there are a myriad of strange connections and a mountain of circumstantial evidence, that seems to paint a very dark picture of some sort of criminal activity. People here are just doing what they consider their duty, by being a part of the citizen investigation to expose those involved.\I won't be silenced for disagreeing with you, and others.Of course not. That being said, a disagreement would be fine, but your highly motivated and systematic approach to "debunking" each piece of evidence brought up, may be seen as disingenuous and agenda driven by some of the users here. Especially given the nature and purpose of this sub.
<|endoftext|>Read the followup be the mods. He is literally being told everything he post is spam. If the mods deem what you post the be in bad faith, they can delete it as spam on a whim. everything.Also is reeks of gate keeping. Post anything arguing against the premise of the post, leave. I would reevaluate my life, my goals, my duty as a human? That is what I would do if I were youGreat response from a mod right?
<|endoftext|>Jesus man, I just disagree with you. Why is that such a big deal? Also thank you for the awesome pm's I'm sure are coming my way after you decided I'm the problem with the sub.
<|endoftext|>1 - I talk about conspiracies, I can find examples if you dont believe me. They may not be the same conspiracies that interest you but theyre conspiracies nonetheless2 - how is providing context or sources or counter arguments for something shitting on a conspiracy?3 - Ive never had an alt account, much less an alt account banned.4 - What makes the upvotes I get miraculous or suspicious? Why cant it just be that people agree with me?5 - why did you dodge my question about the other post, with even more aggregated links, being allowed to stay up?
<|endoftext|>I dont know, around 5 I would guess. You can go through my history if you feel suspicious about me, its fine.Btw, if you truly believe he is avoiding bans and acting in bad faith, by all means keep banning him. I just feel from reading this thread you are in the wrong, thats all.
<|endoftext|>I'm not sure about the ages of the victims Mack recruited because of the ambiguity of the charges, but Keith Raniere has had serious accusations of pedophilia in the past:
<|endoftext|>User A - makes up ages of Allison Mack's victims (b/c there has been no announcement of the ages of her victims)User B - Points out the disinfoUser C - whataboutism User D - Points out user doesn't offer the ages of Allison Mack's victimsUser C - whataboutism tho
<|endoftext|>Most of the email seems innocent, what on earth would "I think it has a map that seems pizza-related" mean?  There is a history of pizza being code for child porn. It does predate the emails as well. 
<|endoftext|>Yes there are shills. Better?Now address mine about the folks hiding in the conclave with moderators ganging up on real users because they disagree. Are those shills?
<|endoftext|>While not required, you are requested to use the NP (No Participation) domain of reddit when crossposting. This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans. The NP domain can be accessed by replacing the "www" in your reddit link with "np".*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/conspiracy) if you have any questions or concerns.*
<|endoftext|>In my opinion, one of the most compelling elements is [the hot tub reference]( As a grown ass adult, children in a hot tub would never be described as "entertainment".
<|endoftext|>I don't have an agenda I just know all of the pizzagate story, and none of it implies pedophillia. 
<|endoftext|>If they were involved in "child sex trafficking" then the media would be all over it, but since it's just some adult prostitutes nobody is interested.
<|endoftext|>I asked you 7 days ago to provide a link to prove your claim. You did not provide one, so were you lying?
<|endoftext|>It's simply beyond belief Ryan wouldn't have mentioned who was making these "terroristic threats" in the police report - I'm sure if Alefantis knew this was still ongoing he'd have a law suit on his hands. 
<|endoftext|>I could say you're highly motivated to attack these people with no evidence or criminal complaints. You don't have superiority here. 
<|endoftext|>There is no easy way to moderate a forum like this. It's a double edge sword because eventually you have to be the authority on something, basically the opposite of what we're trying to do here by getting others to think for themselves. Eventually the power structure running this sub becomes the very monster they were once fighting against. No easy way around that. But you've just gotta draw a line somewhere, or else the whole thing becomes a shit show.And I did offer a solution in my previous comment.I'm coming from a position of knowledge here. I saw the leaked conclave discussions where the mods were talking about who they think is problematic or spamming the sub. JoeyBulgaria was one of them. What I realized by reading through the conclave leak was that I was peering into the nature of humanity, and seeing how the mods of this sub are potentially becoming the monster they are so much against, how power eventually corrupts because enough people agree on something that the blame never falls on one person's shoulders.I do however support their move in getting rid of the forum slide "spam" by Joey. I said that I would not have a problem if he posted it here in the thread again, but it being the top comment basically derails this entire thread and that is a problem.
<|endoftext|>Yeah cheese pizza can be used to mean child pornography and has been around for a long time.Now the email readsThe realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems **pornography**-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know youre busy, so feel free not to respond if its not yours or you dont want it.And that's your evidence that John Podesta is a pedophile - because a woman used the word pizza in an email sent to him about real estate and a lost handkerchief.John repliesIt's mine, but not worth worrying about. does this reply implicate him as a child abuser? 
<|endoftext|>If thats what you really think happens in the conclave, keep up your delusions. Its hilarious to watch you get unhinged. Now youre just trying to bait me into a rule 10. You seem very jealous you werent invited to the conclave. 
<|endoftext|>There was no reference to a hot tub. Personally I can see how children having fun can be described as entertainment, especially for the grandparents the email was distributed between.I saved the following comment which describes the event in more detail. The party was an annual get together of friends who knew each other from having worked together as Congressional staffers. The [people invited]( were men and women in their mid-50s, mostly married couples (except for the bottom row in that photo array). John Podesta and his wife were invited, but couldn't attend. I think Mary is actually the one who is friends with them because, the previous year, the invitation was sent to her email and she forwarded it to John because she was going to be out of the country.In the email, she's letting the guests know that the pool is going to be open and heated even though the party was in October that year so they'll bring their bathing suits. From the email: With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gangs visit to the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought Id share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so youll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).By the way, I don't know if you have ever played with kids in a swimming pool, but it is actually fun in a completely nonsexual way. They like to be thrown through the air and to stand on your shoulders and jump off and you can totally destroy them in a splash battle.Mostly I've done it with my own kids but the last time we were at a church picnic at a lake, three boys were pretend-attacking me (one on each arm and one on my back) and I walked out where it was deep enough that they were all floating so I could toss them around. Then the one on my back climbed a little higher and I couldn't move and the water was right up to my mouth! Haha, suddenly I'm almost drowning! Since I didn't know how well they could swim, I didn't want to duck under the water to shake them off. Eventually I managed to take a step onto higher ground.
<|endoftext|>Just for the record, as a grown adult who has raised children, there were plenty of times over the years when my children were young that I referred to them as "entertainment" to our friends raising their own children. They are activity and bustle and occupy a lot of attention, hence "entertainment". So just one vote for, I don't see this as odd in the slightest.
<|endoftext|>Well, if you know the 'whole' pizzagate story, then I'm assuming you've gone over to the voat pizzagate and read about all the various rabbitholes they've uncovered. The issue with pizzagate isn't comet ping pong itself, it's a wider issue of political pedophilia and human trafficking via The Clinton Global Initiative. And all the players have this strange connection to Comet Ping Pong.ALSO: if you know the 'whole' story, please explain Heavy Breathing to me.
<|endoftext|>I have read the emails, I have found the specific ones where they cite ordering walnut sauce casually. Whatever the fuck that could mean. Your account seems to be here to discredit Truth seekers. Carry on
<|endoftext|>My comment is defending the subreddit against being called paranoid.Why didn't you give any warning to the one calling me paranoid? HMMM. INTERESTING.
<|endoftext|>Forcing people to participate in a sex cult by using blackmail *is sex slavery*. I'm not sure how you are calling this "prostitution".I'm concerned at how adamantly you argue that sex trafficking and sex slavery don't exist *at all*, much less child sex slavery and pedo-blackmail. 
<|endoftext|>Reddit = corporate censorship. Alternatives: Voat.co, Saidit.net, Gab.aiDo yourself a favor and opt-out!Here's the app I'm using to edit my comments: should too! 
<|endoftext|>Child trafficking was listed in the charges that came out.And no, it wouldn't be all over the media because they have been complicit in covering up their own anchors sex crimes, like Jimmy Saville at the BBC.
<|endoftext|>I'm sure if Alefantis knew this was still ongoing he'd have a law suit on his hands.I'm not sure about that. I've mentioned that slander/libel lawsuits are pretty difficult to win. Even if he did give the police a name, his defense in a lawsuit could *easily* be "I thought it was JA, but I could have been wrong/trolled/whatever". How can anyone prove he was lying, rather than wrong?But even if he prove he lied, JA would still need to show that those videos, specifically, caused him some kind tangible harm, which is also fairly difficult.But let's say he did win the lawsuit, that would still do absolutely nothing, zilch, nada, in placating pizzagate believers.I think it's more likely JA doesn't want to feed the fire by launching a lawsuit that would only bring unwanted attention.
<|endoftext|> You don't have superiority here. Well, you saying it's "clearly bullshit" doesn't make your opinion superior in any way, and in fact shows that you can't PROVE it's bullshit, just state it baldly like it's fact when it isn't. And if you say that zhanli is highly motivated in his attack, well duh. These people are sick. If something rubs the wrong way against human nature, people are gonna have a visceral reaction. 
<|endoftext|>There is a difference between Harsh/strong moderating and what I personally have seen in this thread. This is closer to a tantrum.Would you agree that it could have been handled better and clearer? Maybe we can agree on that at least.
<|endoftext|>Yeah I don't want you to get shitty PMs, so this doesn't really change my perspective of you blowing me up for no reason.You have a lot more sway with people in this sub than me, I never really post here. So it kind of felt like you are setting the dogs on me with that type of comment.
<|endoftext|>Dude, I just don't agree with your moderating in this thread. I don't know why this has to be a bigger deal than that.But I guess you know everything about me after like 10 minutes, I have a feeling nothing I say will change that.
<|endoftext|>the kids might be under the age of ~~13~~ 99. I said might asshole. And Oprah references aren't relevant any longeryou might be part of the denialism that helps perpetuate this disgusting problem?there have been no verifiable ages of the parties Allison Mack abused. Or would you like to stop blowing smoke and start providing any verifiable proof of Allison Mack's victims. The showboating is just that - you're blowinghard with an agenda
<|endoftext|> If thats what you really think happens in the conclave, keep up your delusions.I mean, it kind of looks like that's what's [going on there]( It's possible that it's just a bad example that makes that subreddit look worse than it actually is. Like that thread is taken out of context of larger, more detailed discussions going on there in other threads. The problem is that "outsiders" have no way of knowing what's going on and what's being discussed. Making a private subreddit for only certain "chosen" users to be able to discuss this subreddit with the mods is basically asking for people to suspect that something nefarious is going on, even if it isn't.
<|endoftext|>That's a great response. Thanks for sharing the counterpoint.I like the last paragraph the best. It totally doesn't make you sound creepy at all.
<|endoftext|>The issue is comet ping pong via the Podesta emails was the corner stone of early pizzagate investigations so to move the story to some tertiary 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon seems disingenuous. 
<|endoftext|>Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. First violations will usually result in a warning but bans are at the mods' discretion.
<|endoftext|>It's a reference to a piece of pizzagate "evidence" ie a bar in Washington called l'enfant.
<|endoftext|>I never called you anything i said based on your post structure you SEEM to be and thats my own opinion. Like for example hey buddy I know youre not normally a butthead but today you sure are acting like one :p make sense? Dont worry i would never propagandize you its happened to me too many times but sorry if you felt offended
<|endoftext|>Where was "child trafficking" listed in the charges that came out? don't see anything about children or underage people, but maybe I missed it.
<|endoftext|>What people are sick? There's no evidence Podesta, Alefantis or anyone else named in the pizzagate allegations has abused a child.Yes child abuse is sick but that's no excuse to attack people based on their friends co workers instagram posts. 
<|endoftext|>I added more to my comment above.I'd say they handled it alright, but could have been a bit more clear.People just need to know this sub is under fire constantly by mischief makers. It's nearly impossible to sort the good intentions from the bad intentions sometimes. So a line just has to be drawn. Joey will survive, everything will be OK. He should just repost his comment like I said.Also to be honest, I have problems with some of the mods here but I don't allow that to get in my way. My mission is much larger than a squabble with some moderator on some forum on the internet.
<|endoftext|>	The problem is that "outsiders" have no way of knowing what's going on and what's being discussed. Making a private subreddit for only certain "chosen" users to be able to discuss this subreddit with the mods is basically asking for people to suspect that something nefarious is going on, even if it isn't.The chosen users are users who have been active in conspiracy for a long time, and participate. Since the election, there has been a huge influx of users who come here to forum slide and manipulate comment sections. Coincidencently, the only conspiracy they will claim exists is Trump Russia collusion, which has been pushed by the mainstream, project mockingbird media In particular, /r/TopMindsOfReddit is where many of these users come from. Rule 13 and the 2 month account rule was made to combat the brigades and forum sliding. They will stalk users, and have attempted to dox them in the past. In case you are wondering why reddit admins allow the blatant site wide rule breaking, it is likely sanctioned as it has support from mainsteam media.
<|endoftext|>Np, also ninja edited - there was no reference to a "hot tub" which immediately has more sexual connotations than "heating the pool" - an example of how important language and syntax is, particularly with pizzagate. 
<|endoftext|>What's up man, where's that explanation of Heavy Breathing? You know, Amanda Kleinman, on video made a joke about everyone 'having their preferences' after someone yelled out 'little kids' or something? How about sexstains too, while we're at it? The pedo triangle in their music videos? The two bands \(that are shitty bands, I should add\) that played all the time at Comet...you know what I'm talking about, right expert? What's up with that? You're an expert on this, right?Why did Alefatis' sister write a letter of support for a pedophile that molested a buncha girls? What's up with that? Hassert, Kloman...oh, how about George Nadar? Caught with a shit ton of child porn on him. Here's a pic of him with Tony & Bill Clinton: [ these people sure are friends with a lot of convicted pedophiles! What's up with that? Again, I don't know any pedophiles....do you? But, oh wait, I forgot, there's nothing to pizzagate right? You're the expert...please explain this to me, oh wise one!Or, are you not gonna say shit because there is no explanation, and you fuckin knoooooow it.lil batch.
<|endoftext|>Nah, because everyone suspects the initial people named in pizzagate have something to do with the other stuff. The fact that Tony & John were/are friends with a convicted pedophile (Hassert) deserves at least an explanation....how many pedophiles are you friends with? If I found out my friend was a pedophile, I would immediately cut ties with him, why didn't the Podestas?All those cats are NTBT, imo. At the very least, some of this shit should be explained. But that has never happened, the narrative has been reduced to 'oh, you think kids were trafficked in a pizza parlor? FAKE NEWS', without really explaining or offering up an explanation of all the circumstantial evidence that IS valid, or DOES deserve further examination.Also: awaiting your Heavy Breathing explanation. 
<|endoftext|>You are just someone who is here to shit on those who seek the truth lol. Dont like trump really never did but he is definitely doing things behind the scenes to stop the elite child PEDO rings. Hence ALLISON MACKInsider in on most of the elite events that happen in Hollywood. 
<|endoftext|>The acceptable thing is to address their arguments, civilly point out that their arguments are lacking, or downvote and move on; not to attack the user. 
<|endoftext|>Reddit = corporate censorship. Alternatives: Voat.co, Saidit.net, Gab.aiDo yourself a favor and opt-out!Here's the app I'm using to edit my comments: should too! 
<|endoftext|>This isn't a court of law, and I don't have to argue evidence with you. But if you think people base this off just a "friends co-workers instagram posts" is EXTREMELY disingenuous. How is Clinton's connection to Laura Silsby, a KNOWN child trafficker, ZERO evidence? HMMM??? Now, I could see past the Moloch comment by Clinton, IF she didn't have these nagging associations with scumbags. 
<|endoftext|>If nothing changed except the mods comments in this thread I would feel better. But they are just so antagonistic and aggressive, it comes across almost childish. Like it not healthy for the sub in the long run, I think.
<|endoftext|>You don't think they are code? What could a pizza related map even be? Why would it be on a handkerchief? How can you read that sentence and not think it sounds very strange?
<|endoftext|>I don't think some shitty hipster bands with weird videos are evidence of child abuse. If you do that's up to you. Regardless, how does a heavy breathing music video and the fact that Podesta knows Hastert (who was abusing school boys in the 70s) indicate an active pedophile ring? George Nader is an interesting one, he was actually more recently an advisor to Donald Trump and is part of the Mueller investigation  here's Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer having a cigar with a convicted child trafficker, Tevfik Arif a few weeks ago. 
<|endoftext|>Have you reported the comment? I don't read every comment in every thread. Today I have mostly worked off the report queue because I've been busy with real life. 
<|endoftext|>Clinton never made a Moloch comment, that was in an email to her again.Silsby served her time in Haitian jail, Clinton didn't get her off. 
<|endoftext|>Well what bothers me is that they make a rule against calling someone a shill, yet behind closed doors they are categorizing who they think are shills. Seems toxic in a way, but I don't really know what moderating a big sub like this entails.
<|endoftext|>Could it be something like... more reasonable to assume Kathryn and Susan are talking about a novelty handkerchief than switching between talking about pillows and houses to child abuse in the same email chain. 
<|endoftext|>Bro, I went through your post history. You latch onto minutia, intentionally miss the point, don't respond to the actual point, and you derail.So, what, you're probably buddies with these guys or something, huh? I'm a super duper skeptical person (and quite articulate as well, as you can see), but even I know something's fucky here. If you don't, you're deliberately missing the point. Whatever man, I don't even care. Have fun posting on pizzagate threads trying to derail the conversation. Have fun with whatever you do in your free time.I've come to the conclusion people are absolute sheep and won't do anything to change their situation, no matter what kind of stuff is shoved in their faces, so I won't even deign to say some bullshit like, 'one day, we're gonna get your kind', because honestly, no one probably will.Must be nice.EDIT: and actually, just to respond to your point about shitty hipster bands (because I kind of enjoy dismantling your weak jousts). Still no response from you about the Amanda Kleinman remark. I grew up down the street from a prolific pedophile ( and he literally had that pedo sign on his front door. He got arrested for trying to buy a baby from his nurse...seeing that symbol in light of these pizzagate allegations, I remembered that dude's door from my childhood. So, a band that has that blatant imagery in their videos, and they performed regularly at comet ping pong?The point is, all of these connections to pedophiles, these people rub elbows with pedophiles on the regular...that SHOULD be enough circumstantial evidence to investigate this further. You're obviously not able to explain them away. And yeah, Trump's people mess with child abusers too. Clinton and Trump are buddies with Jeffrey Epstein. It's both sides of the aisle.But you already know all this, I imagine. I'm mainly writing this as an exercise for myself.It's fun to shit on people that are wrong. I guess if this is a troll thing, you won.But I kinda won too, in a way.
<|endoftext|>Keep backing yourself into a corner lol. Largest darkweb sites seized. You probably like the fact that children are abused. Hope you realize most people other than elites cant afford the $100,000 price tags of live humans 
<|endoftext|>I've been called a sockpuppet and the problem with the sub by mod in this thread. I've done nothing but disagree with his style of moderating. Rules absolute does not get applied to the mods or who the mods agree with.
<|endoftext|>Well, any one of these things is going to be able to be written off, but when they are all taken together, then you start to think, "maybe this isn't some innocuous message about an actual handkerchief. "
<|endoftext|>I don't see how discussing the details of the allegations can be considered derailing the thread. A thread specifically about the allegations.You may be articulate but it isn't me who is missing the point.You have started from the position that Podesta and Co are child abusers so you add all these little bits of not even worrying instagram posts and friends of friends paintings they talk about in news paper articles and use that to paint a pedo picture.I also note you dodging my point about Nader and Cohen which is convenient for you so I guess we're even for me ignoring the singer of a band. You can tell I'm hitting a nerve with you because you resort to personal attacks on my character (of which you know nothing) and of my post history (which is no secret).I won't lower myself to your level. 
<|endoftext|>You have to look at the bigger, bigger picture though.This sub is still doing alright. Conspiracy theories are still being discussed with enthusiasm. People are being red pilled and waking up. That's great! That's all I really want from a sub like this.There are going to be innocent bystanders hit by a stray bullet. Hopefully they will recognize it's just water under the bridge.
<|endoftext|>The thing for me is, all the allegations can be written off. In totality the theory isn't cohesive, with threads from Podestas real estate agent to James Alefantis instagram friends and Tony Podestas ex wife's role on a Washington police charity. It's all cooked together to paint this magic eye picture that even when you squint doesn't create a decipherable image. 
<|endoftext|>Admit to what? Are you going to tell your programmer that you dont have enough code to fight this level of truth? Sorry Bot, go tell Soros that you need more funding!
<|endoftext|>If the sub is run by people I don't trust to be fair, how am I supposed to believe in it?I know it would never happen, but I just wan't simple rules, harsh or not don't matter, applied dispassionately. I feel there is too much ego involved.
<|endoftext|>It's an obstacle, but you need to realize fairness is subjective and nobody is perfect. Spend enough time here and it becomes a nonissue. It's the most diverse place I've found, where the members have enough trust to talk to one another about any idea with an open mind, but enough distrust to avoid falling into a hive mind mechanic.
<|endoftext|>There used to be a mod here TheGhostOfDusty. I was super suspicious of his behavior. He always wanted to enforce the rules strictly and fairly between everyone. He always had problems with one thing or another. He hated seeing any discussion about Pizzagate. He always caused drama about things. He was fucking full of himself, and now here he is acting in bad faith like our worst enemy, playing for team TMOR and making a whole bunch of drama out of this thread in an attempt to smear the mods and get back at them because he still has an axe to grind: that puts a few things in perspective. It's an ongoing battle. Some switch sides. But the true nature of the sub is still here, red pills are being dished out, so I can't really complain who comes and goes as moderator. My own power is expressed through sheer research and not having to deal with drama. I'd rather research than deal with drama. The mods don't have an easy job especially when ego gets in the way, and let's be honest we all have an ego hiding somewhere.
<|endoftext|>I would agree that the users seems to be pretty diverse, but I strongly disagree with the open mind thing.Any post about a political subject descends into low effort name calling and people screaming shill til they are blue in the head.I have no idea how you have avoided that.
<|endoftext|>So? I would have hated his moderating, it sounds terrible. Posting Pizzagate on a conspiracy forum makes perfect sense, I just happen to not believe it.After all this back and forth, you still assume I don't like the moderation because of partisan reasons. I specifically said I wanted mods the abstain from that sort of behavior.
<|endoftext|>Politics are the damn Holy Grail of conspiracy. Of course that's where all the action is :D I usually just try to learn new things from the comments (skip over the drama), or drop some knowledge I already have about the topic and move on. The biggest distraction here is the drama that plays out from name calling, but you can navigate around it, or if you're bored, take a jab! Don't forget Reddit is also entertainment, not always meant to be taken seriously.
<|endoftext|>Dusty was the "ideal mod" in most people's minds, but it didn't work out.We also had a really great mod here Orangutan who was kicked out for having financial ties to a 9/11 movement. But he was an excellent mod.What I'm saying is, everyone's different and each person brings along their demons and convictions. We've had two "ideal" moderators who didn't last, and perhaps for good reason. It's probably for the best that things keep flowing and chairs keep changing.
<|endoftext|>My point was just that most discussions on here descend into mudslinging and shill accusations, thats a constant problem.I mostly stay out of political threads on reddit because of that, I didn't this time and immediately it went to shit.
<|endoftext|>I never said they would be "ideal", stop implying that. You bring up mods I don't know as if I suggested they were good examples of impartial mods. Dusty sounds like a biased powertripper and Orangutan had i financial ties that disqualified him. I feel ok with both of them being de-modded.Everyone brings their own biases, but I would hope they don't apply them to their modding decisions. Right now, I can't say that at all.
<|endoftext|>I said they were ideal to a lot of people. I bring them up because they should have been the star mods who appeal to everyone, but they weren't. The point being, there is no mod who is fit for everyone. You may find yourself in a situation where you think a mod fulfills all of your ideals, but chances are, they are pissing someone else off at the same time. Orangutan for example.I've sometimes thought I would make a great mod here, until I realized people can and will find any reason to question your authoritative actions, and from there, it becomes a game of wit and ego. I'd rather not get dragged into that when I'm here to research conspiracies not play a part in a soap opera. I'd rather just swing the ban hammer heavy and hard at those people and not look back or care who I pissed off. So I don't think I'd make a good mod, even with all the insight and understanding I have about the nature of it.
<|endoftext|>All I ask for from a mod is this, dont engage. Do your modding and nothing else. Ban, delete, be harsh, be fair, just dont make it personal and follow your own rules. Don't make it about you.You may feel differently, but I strongly feel the sub would be better if mods just didn't antagonize the people they mod.This thread should just have been put in contest mode and move on. All the mocking just makes you are target for people outside the sub and distances people not in agreement with you.
<|endoftext|>yeah, I'm sure you have had a similar experience somewhere on reddit. This is by no means exclusive to conspiracy by any means.People on the internet sucks.
<|endoftext|>The one story that sold me on demonic possession is the one out of [Gary Indiana]( alot of proof and multiple eyewitnesses including the police, nurses, doctors, CPS workers, etc. What is most intriguing to me is the [Official Report from Child Protective Services]( who had been notified. In their report they witnessed: "According to Washington's original DCS report  an account corroborated by Walker, the nurse  the 9-year-old had a "weird grin" and walked backward up a wall to the ceiling. He then flipped over Campbell, landing on his feet. He never let go of his grandmother's hand. "He walked up the wall, flipped over her and stood there," Walker told The Star. "There's no way he could've done that."The article I referenced is full of official reports. 
<|endoftext|>I once worked nights in an old hospital and got to know nurses that had been working there for a long time. I was speaking with a lady who was relating that she'd seen a particular figure repeatedly over the passage of many years and had noticed a funny thing - over time the figure's feet/ lower legs were no longer visible.I looked into this and discovered that the floor level in that area had been raised over time - I have encountered a theory suggesting that stone/ water can act to store event data in a way not understood. This would fit well with the example I gave above - like a psychic recording which is periodically replayed. The lady I spoke to was nearing retirement, the head nurse on the ward and unlikely to be making this up for a giggle. Experience of 'weird stuff' was fairly common among the nursing staff
<|endoftext|>Can anyone here help me out with finding out just where the hell I've been going in my dreams over 20+ years? I can picture the roads, the houses, freaking everything and could even probably draw a map. I know when I've been there the minute I wake up although now that I am older I don't go as often and miss my friends there :( Seemed like an excellent thread to get some advice in, thank you in advance!
<|endoftext|>I think Dr. Barry Taff has a pretty good theory. It's summarized in [this article]( from Reality Sandwich. In short: Taff lists three variables that act together in concert to produce the physical manifestations of a good old-fashioned haunting: 1) The haunted site is located in an electromagnetically (EMF) anomalous environment 2) The poltergeist agent is usually prone to seizures or epileptic, and their biomagnetic field emits well over one million times the amplitude compared to the average person and 3) The poltergeist agent is neurologically wired in a way, usually an inability to cope with stress, that enables their nervous system to hyper-react to said environment and wreak paranormal havoc.Once these conditions are met, all bets are off, Dr. Taff bluntly assures, anything could occur. So, if youd like to, imagine all your deep-seated, psychological frustrations and anxieties literally coming to life, as it were, and going bump in the nightSomeone else listed this [talk by Dr. Taff]( last week and I found it very interesting. I hope others will too. Full disclosure: I believe in ghosts. I am an amateur paranormal investigator. I've seen and experienced some weird stuff, but nothing that made me say for sure "that's a ghost." 
<|endoftext|>I sorta think the Afterlife should be its own round table (hidden knowledge of an afterlife in ancient societies. Origin of all religious views being truth or control etc, Near Death Experiences, how to exit the matrix). Now its mixed in with Ghosts Stories and Goblins. :/
<|endoftext|>Past life experiences anybody? In [Magick Without Tears]( Aleister Crowley gives a recipe for magickal memory which is simple enough that an average high school freshman could probably do it. *Everybody* I know who has done this has spooked them self.Step I: meditate into full relaxed / theta state -- give it 20 minutes. Step II: mentally walk backwards chronologically through your life--yesterday, last week, last month, last year, 2 years back, 3 years back, &c. It probably helps to pay particular attention to any memorable detailed sensations -- sights, sounds, smells, whatnot -- of people whom you were intimate with. Sex partners are the absolute most valuable items.Go back all the way as close to time zero as you can. For most people their first fixed permanent memories are from their third birthday plus/minus six months. Step III: go back even further. If you were born after the moon landing, meditate on the moon landing. If you were born after the JFK assassination, meditate on the JFK assassination. Just keep meditation focussed on traveling backwards through time. I do not have a really huge sample on this, maybe 10 people total but every single person that I have discussed this with has had some very spooky thought about actually being another person who was alive before they were born. And experiences like that person drowning, or burning up in a fire, or getting executed for a crime. These *memories* can be as seemingly authentic as anything from your real life.Also this is a bit of a tangent but if you know nothing about Crowley and you are interested that book is by far the easiest introduction. They are letters to a correspondent. She was rich and she was stupid and Crowley deliberately paced the content so that anybody who could read could grok the content.
<|endoftext|>Like a lot of folks here, I'm very interested in these topics. Skeptical, but open to documented evidence and science. I appreciate James Randi who helps debunk fake claims of supernatural powers. But there are things he cannot explain. Anyone who studies physics already knows that the nature of matter, energy, and consciousness are still not fully understood. One example that springs to mind are children with details past life stories. Hoax? Or is it possible our "minds" live on after our bodies expire? Here's a story of a child who was born with memories of a fighter pilot who died in war. Really hope science can tell us more about the phenomena. 
<|endoftext|>Thoughts on michael grubb on youtubes ability to essentially air bend, earth bend, fire bend and water bend if anyone here watched avatar the last airbender on nickolodeon back in the day, this phenomenon is known as hydrokinesis, aerokonesis, pyrokinesis and geokinesis respectively. He seems to be able to make mini leaf tornadoes on some of his videos in locations without wind flowing/turbulence so hes clearly getting energy from somewhere and bending the elements around him, it seems quite limited though and only small things can be done.
<|endoftext|>Possession is real and it happens all the time. "People" can literally step into you and manipulate your thoughts and actions. Don't ask me how I know this... Noone believes its possible that's why its so hard to tell people that it is. 
<|endoftext|>Here's the mother of all conspiracies. Gonna do this bullet point-style. We live in a matrix We are here because someone wants us here for some reason. Perhaps we are in a prison. Perhaps we are an energy source. But we are trapped here no matter what. When we die, they put us back in the matrix. The catch is, we have to agree to go. The way back into the matrix is by walking into the light. They trick you into going to the light by subliminally making sure that you are fed this idea of "walk towards the light" in movies and tv shows all your life. They also have your relatives there guiding you to the light (these are not your relatives - these are probably just code). We live our life, die, go back in the matrix, and the circle repeats itself. We could be here forever and ever. It could never end. They have us mentally enslaved. How do we get out? I believe that the only true way out of here is finding enlightenment through meditation - but this is no easy feat. The original historical Buddha said that we live in a world of illusion. He said that matter didn't exist. He said that meditation is the key to liberation. I'm still looking into all of this, but I'll tell you this - when I die, I'm not walking towards the light. I'll take a good look around first. We are in a matrix - proven and the tunnel of light Star Trek clip
<|endoftext|> is a photo of a ghost I took at Chillingham castle about six years ago. The black thing most definitely was not there. About three years ago I saw a ghost in our warehouse. As have many others who worked there, big burley blokes terrified to go to the toilet on their own lol. I also lived in a haunted house in bakewell Derbyshire called the hall. Its searchable on the net and for any of you yanks want to see what a real haunted house looks like. Thats one. I grew up knowing small things just jumped. It was totally normal to me till about the age of 7. It didnt phase me one bit and when we moved it was kind of strange small things didnt jump. Are there ghosts ? Yes 100% there are. I took a photo of one I know what you see there was not there. I know anyone else would have to be skeptical but there it is. Afterlife ? Yes we live in a situation and this is actually the non real state, so in fact we return to life if that makes sense, and yes we return. As for souls in purgatory ? I dont know. Maybe there is a place in between the two realities. And what we do here resonates in the other world Im fairly sure of that. Hope you like the pic 
<|endoftext|>I have never seen any evidence of an afterlife. Even the idea of being a ghost seems silly. Where are all the cavemen ghosts? Animal ghosts? Ill be damned if after I die Im going to be stuck to some shitty spot I died in. 
<|endoftext|>Here is a ghost story from the time I went to Citrix Synergy conference several years ago and stayed at the Linq \(previously known as Imperial Palace\). I was staying at the hotel and had just gone through an argument with my wife. Upset, slightly depressed, and with my luggage I went to the emergency stairway to relax my mind near the Penthouse \(20th floor\) somewhere near there. I stayed there for a good hour and noticed there was a cigarette sitting on top of a light switch box near the exit door with the tip barely burnt. I thought it was strange that someone would leave their cigarette unfinished. I got bored and walked to the top floor and saw nothing except a roof opening, curious I jumped up to see a lit room with pipes and nothing more. Next to the opening there was a Bic lighter, I grabbed it and instantly thought, hey I think I can go for a smoke with the cigarette that I last saw somewhere on the 18 floor. I leave my stuff and walked down the stair way about two floors. Looked at the light switch and noticed the cigarette was gone, however the dust that surrounded the cigarette was there. At that moment I had the biggest goose bumps all over my body. So, I thought to myself the cigarette wasn't mine and said out loudly, This is yours \(with the lighter held on my right hand\) and placed it where the light switch was near the dust outline of the cigarette. I also made a mental note in my head that if this lighter disappears then for sure there is some paranormal activity. I then proceeded to walked up to the 20th floor and grabbed my luggage and walk back down. The stairway is made out of metal and when you walk the noise is very loud and creates clinks, I know no one else was in the stairway. I got to the 18th floor and noticed the Bic lighter is now missing. At that moment I tried to open the exit door and it was locked and kept walking down the stairway and all the floors doors were locked. It wasn't until I was on the 12th floor that a security guard opened a door near the 10th. I yelled to hold the door \(no reference to GOT\) and walked out with the security guard. I told him that I was stuck and couldn't get out. He advised that all the stairway doors are locked. I told him about my experience and what happened with the missing lighter and cigarette. He gave me a blank stare and said it could happen since the hotel is very old. That evening I started looking up and found there was a man who jumped to his death [ anyone is interested and paranormal activity, verify my experience by giving a cigarette to the spirit walk up a few floors and walk back down. 
<|endoftext|>everytime I try to write about this stuff something happens and my phone closes or something crazy like that..I've always had a strange relationship with Spirits I thought everybody did.what people don't realize is the True Light is the light from within... God is our soul, the light comes from within. God gives you a soul and the world gives you an ego and you need to Choose Wisely and be a good person, have a relationship with Dad, repent for your sins, help others and be kind and die in your soul not your ego to go to heaven.we all are blessed with spiritual eyes living and dead we are all energy and we all matter living or dead on Earth we need to open our spiritual eyes and in death we need to open our spiritual eyes or they need to be open when we die to go to heaven the people or spirits who believe they are lost have their eyes open to the darkness, but have their spiritual eyes closed to The Light Within....just like we have to close our eyes to meditate just open our spiritual eyes, they have to close their eyes to the darkness and feel the light from within. I speak to spirits like the apostles because all Spirits matter God does not give up on spirits who are believed to be lost or are in the pitI give the spirits that leave their lost and in the pit comfort and I try to help them, I try to help them open their spiritual eyes and feel God's love & let them know that he is not abandoned them..I love them and I let them know that they still matter & I care.kind and loving spirits turned me back to God through Steve Huff Spirit Box radio sessions.I'm not perfect, I'm a sinner, I'm a Child of God I'm not a nun I'm not a saint a human being I do my best to live my life as honestly as possible and to be kind of others..people have to give ...rich people and poor people have the same thing we all have God and we have enough to give to help each other and that's what we need to do is to help one another and raise the frequency of the universe and universes and bring peace love and understanding to the world and need to each other...the more all spirits come together for the greater good living and dead and the more we raise the frequency and we become positive , kind loving caring giving and we help one another the more good things will happen in this world and universe.. It's like a domino effect...good things like the North and South Korea peace treaty.. Walmart investing in their workers to give them college educations.... and other wonderful things that are happening in the worldwhen I felt lost and alone I went to the cemetery and they comforted me so they still have God's love in their heart, and I believe it was a test for them from God to see how they treated me and to find out if there was still hope and there is there's always hope as long as we're live as long as we're Spirits alive or dead there's always hope evil spirits and he kind of spirits were all energy and we never die.they were angry with me at first some of them because I was there because they didn't understand why I was there and I told them even though I have life I don't have loved ones I'm alone I don't have what they have I might have life but I don't have what they have people that love and miss them and I felt alone and I had nowhere to go and then they understood...so I came to them to ask for love and kindness and comfort and they gave it to me.they get upset that when people come to visit they ignore all the other spirits and only focus on their loved ones because sometimes they don't have loved ones that come to visit them so I go to visit all of them and give them love because they all need it some of them just visit here and some of them are stuck...and they do still matter just like all energy matters, like all Spirits matter living and dead, we are all brothers and sisters in God and he is our father and we are his children as long as we have a soul we have God we are only in darkness if you choose to be and it's never too late,there's always a way back home.He's the light within us.I'm on a mission from God literally I am one half of a twin flame Unionhere to raise the frequency of the universe/universesim here to show & speak and communicate to spirits living & dead about God the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ and remind them that we are all one & they need to start living in their spirit be balanced. In the material world have a relationship with our father repent for their sins try to be good person be kind help others and don't die in their ego die with their spirit in their spirit so they can go to heavenGod and Spirits know your soul and they will treat you accordingly.I photograph spirits Yucca Valley Hangman's house front door Black Swan Innfront window (older gray-haired woman) speak to them through the Holy Spirit that speaks through me & they speak to me.... telepathy & Resonance of heart chakra is the Holy Spirit.I spent three days in the cemetery March 28th right before Easter I don't believe that is a fluke. God sent me there.this was on the third day in the mausoleum every day that I left I felt and renewed spirit and immense love, I felt born again...these are the Spirits speaking "say something"00:48 " we Love you"00:49 " I Love you"01:26 "____ Love's force01:37 " help me".............then I returned and they weren't so welcoming in this part of the mausoleum this is like last week but I don't care dad told me to go I think they're pretty much telling me to get out of there and leave them alone and stuff like that I don't know maybe if you can make it out listen.... I played them a song" Peter Gabriel in your eyes "youtube it .. with the lyricsit's a very spiritual song God is love it starts out love I get to lost sometimes= God I get so lost sometimes.. listen to itthen I told them that people get stuck in there he go and that's why they go to where they go instead of going to heavenand then I recorded this I don't really hear anything on this one and I closed it out with the prayer.. right before I did it , it kinda looks like Jesus is coming out of the wall. a lot of writing okay I'm done I have a lot more stuff but I'm donehopefully I don't get hacked or something
<|endoftext|>I was in the **Astral Afterlife** last night. They have cars (drove one last night). They have houses and restaurants (was in those last night). The deceased are being brutally deceived. They are all being told "you get to go back to balance your karma" and "you only need a few more lives". This is a **Complete Scam** and is **Really Happening** to friends and loved ones we have all lost. I have been talking with people in the afterlife about this. After being seen (communication between the living and dead is completely banned there) the place gets swarmed with law enforcement (Yes. they have that there. In fact it is sort of a **Martial Law** scenario). Other people are experiencing this. **It Is Sadly True**...
<|endoftext|>I am surprised that this thread has gotten as far as it has without anyone mentioning the "lawyer for the afterlife," Victor Zammit, so I will be the first to mention him. He is a retired lawyer and claims to be an authority on what constitutes evidence, who should be considered a credible source, etc. He is convinced that his favorite sources are credible, of course. He also seems to have witnessed numerous unusual phenomena firsthand. I used to read his weekly reports, but they get somewhat repetitive. You may find that he throws sharply contrasting claims into the reports, because he doesn't feel responsible for making a single monolithic narrative. Also some of his issues are nuanced, so a monolithic narrative would be more suspect that a narrative with internal tensions.His afterlife evidence website is at:[
<|endoftext|>I am very interested in the afterlife. Does anyone have any good documentaries to suggest regarding this? 
<|endoftext|>ive never been a big believer in the normal ghost view.personally i believe the human mind/soul whatever you want to call the essence of what we are is really just the electrical pattern jumping around in that little biological computer in our heads a pattern that persists somewhat in the planets electrical field or is just reabsorbed by it some time after physical death.ghosts i think are just echos of these fields, or scars on the large field. when some one dies traumatically i think that pattern just sort of etches itself on the background and sticks around longer than it otherwise would. hauntings are just us picking up on the echo and why most of them are tied to traumatic incidents. 
<|endoftext|>I looked into the phenomenon of people hearing voices and going on murder sprees. All this stuff tends to be like 1 day news stories compared to the mass shootings, but if you count them and look for all of the '3 people killed by lunatic' stories in every different city, there are just so many.   me know what you think. 
<|endoftext|>I've often wondered: Why do ghosts appear to wear clothes? Specifically, they appear to wear the clothes they were presumably buried in. Further, they almost always wear *modern* clothes, or in the case of legendary ghosts maybe Victorian era clothes, but you almost never hear of ghosts wearing loincloths or nude or animal skins even though logic dictates that most ghosts would be from people that lived hundreds if not thousands of years ago simply because most dead people are from hundreds or thousands of years ago.Not only that, but more dead people from hundreds or thousands of years ago would be dead from brutal/unjust causes simply because life was more brutal and unjust in the past. Therefore if the ghost is tied to this plane because of some injustice, you would would think it would be more statistically likely that it would be a caveman ghost.
<|endoftext|>On one occasion at an afterhours rave, I saw two people communicate **Telepathically**. On a different subject: A ghost banged on my bedroom door and later grabbed and squeezed my arm. Once after returning from deep astral travel, I saw the outline of a **Demon** sitting next to my bed. It disappeared after 5 seconds.
<|endoftext|>I've posted this in similar threads... I saw my twin sister passed out drunk playing ouija. It spelled "fuck you get out" did figure of eights and went from sun to moon all very fast while her eyes were closed and she was snoring. She completely changed after that. Also I've seen shadow beings on three separate occasions. On a different note magic mushrooms are really magical. If you've never done them you should.
<|endoftext|>I have a couple of ghost stories:1st ghostly experiences was when I was about 4/5\-7 in my house in the UK, newish property just under 30 years old.I would see shadows in the corner of my eye, when I go to look they instantly disappear. \(this was the most common thing to happen\)Occasionally I would see a transparent blob and know that's the ghost.One day as i went to leave my room I saw my younger brother sitting down on the floor, knees tucked under his chin looking up at me. Except I knew my brother was in the next room getting his nappy changed so I had a strong urged to kick the doppelganger but decided I should actually check just in case. Of course my brother was in the next room so I go back to my room and the impostor is gone.Multiple poltergeist activity, tidied my room up. But left my full toy box in the middle of the room. When we came back home after a family day out the box had been tipped over and my dad tried telling me it was the wind from the tiny opening of the window. Even I knew that was BS.The best evidence that proves to myself I wasn't just imagine these things was when I put a battery on the top step of the stairs as a test before I went down to eat dinner. While my brother and I was eating dinner my mum was hoovering at the bottom of the stairs. Opposite those stairs was the door to the downstairs toilet which was closed. \*BANG\* "who threw this!" my mum yelled as she entered the room waving the battery in her hand but as soon as she saw both us her she realised it wasn't us and looked visibly spooked.We moved after a few months of that happening. Speaking to my parents recently about that house they both said they didn't notice anything spooky or odd except that one battery incident.
<|endoftext|> I highly recommend everybody check out this book on the afterlife and paranormal phenomena of astral travel inhabitants of the Astral Realm and scenery. I would also recommend everyone check out the law of one as it pertains heavily to the Incarnative process, the evolution of the Soul where we're going, where we came from. Basically, the Most Fascinating metaphysical and philosophical subjects are discussed in detail for just a search on after death in the material, I found this  also this bit on the stimuli of the ghost process47.13 Questioner: What stimulus would create what we call an Earth-bound spirit or a lingering ghost?Ra: I am Ra. The stimulus for this is the faculty of the will. If the will of yellow-ray mind/body/spirit is that which is stronger than the progressive impetus of the physical death towards realization of that which comes, that is, if the will is concentrated enough upon the previous experience, the entitys shell of yellow ray, though no longer activated, cannot either be completely deactivated and, until the will is released, the mind/body/spirit complex is caught. This often occurs, as we see you are aware, in the case of sudden death as well as in the case of extreme concern for a thing or an other-self.
<|endoftext|>I have a question about the Archons and not going into the light. So what the hell is supposed to happen to you if you don't go into the light when you die. 
<|endoftext|>Eqafe has a 40 part series and all you need to know about ghosts and the aferlife. Here is a free episode
<|endoftext|>Me and a friend were quite out of it once (let's say we were just taking alcohol..) and we were chilling in the dark, in my living room, listening to music. I saw a wash of blue-ish purple (may have been a little red glow at the core?) suddenly and I felt another presence in my consciousness. I let it take over for a bit, sensing that it wasn't harmful or anything but more out of curiousity than anything. It thought that the music wasn't bad, pretty dope (listening to XXXtentatcion) and bopped along to it for a few beats before leaving my body, passing straight through my friend's body, and out the balcony glass door. I looked at my friend straight away and he shivered as he shook it off. I asked him if he saw what I saw. He says "what?" I say "Did you see the same thing I just saw? What colour was it?"He tells me it was blue.I ask him which way it went.He points out the balcony window.Scariest shit I've ever encountered. Also, I can't say for sure, but when it was inside me I felt like it was a tortured soul, and I had a slim feeling it was just the tortured part of XXXtentacion's soul. I don't know. I don't even listen to him much anymore - but that's as much fucking proof I need of spirits or ghosts existing in the world I think.
<|endoftext|>Can someone explain to me how this topic is conspiracy related at all? There were tons of other topics that actually posed a legitimate threat to our civil liberties we could have picked, but "ghosts reeeeeee" was chosen instead? 
<|endoftext|>The youngest boy, then 7, sat in a closet talking to a boy that no one else could see. The other boy was describing what it felt like to be killed.Yikes, gave me chills.
<|endoftext|>I learned of this through Zak Bagans documentary about the house, but now that Ive read the report you kindly provided I am so sad for the Mum that she had her children taken away for this :-( 
<|endoftext|>Chip Coffey spoke about this article in Gettysburg, he explained that the woman in Quincy actually wanted to be possessed and that the network would not allow them to show the real stuff that was going on. He said that the woman could open, close doors, stretch her features, distort your thinking, he said she wounded people. The network would not allow the footage on air. 
<|endoftext|>Yes,worked geriatrics for 5 years. I got so used to weird shit, I'd just shrug my shoulders and get on with my rounds.
<|endoftext|>Your theory is correct, I use to live in Colorado. The natives discussed paranormal activity, quartz, rock and the rivers that all flow out of Colorado. Why do you think Tesla went to Cripple Creek? The magnetic energy, water and stone. They have proven what you say goes up in the atmosphere and is recorded, so yes, you are correct. I will send links but you can google this and find scientific data to support your theory.
<|endoftext|>Take notes and draw maps. Look for signs and names especially. With enough clues, maybe one of the subreddits can help. 
<|endoftext|>Do you mean where, on earth, you've been going? As in what specific town or city? Or do you mean where does your conscious energy go? If you mean the first one, then can you describe the place you've been going? Is it a real place you've actually visited in the past, or is it somewhere you've only exclusively gone in your dreams? Does it change? Are you still going there? I think seeing that map would be interesting if you wouldn't mind drawing it out. And it would be useful to hear about your interactions with the people there. 
<|endoftext|>That's not a question any of us can help you with, but you already have all the information you need, even if you aren't aware of it. Your subconscious mind is trying to bring something to your attention, and it uses symbols in dreams to do so. As you said later in the thread, these symbols are very fluid and as such your conscious mind will have trouble. My advice is to find peace and, as backward as it sounds, stop trying to understand it. Sit down with a blank page and write down every little thing that comes to your mind (the map is a good idea), it may or may not be related to your dream. By letting go of what you already know about it, you make room for your subconscious to show you again, this time with maybe more relevant data. Just keep looking within, brother. With patience and peace, you'll find what you're looking for.
<|endoftext|>It is very likely the Astral City called **Jean De Lac**. this is a real place. It has a large suburban area outside the city with roads, houses etc.. I have been there dozens of times. The other night I ended up in a beach resort town. I was told it was part of the **French Islands**. It was a beautiful place, but unfortunately had law enforcement all over the area. The deceased people there were speaking mostly English, but there was some French. At one point I actually asked a group of people how to get to **Jean De Lac** from these islands, and was told it was a very far travel distance from there.
<|endoftext|>So what you just explained falls COMPLETELY in line with the comment I just posted above. I think it probably has to do with specific areas of the brain which control embodiment (understanding that your body and brain are the same) getting shut down and literally allowing another spinning energy to make a visit... one which might register quite a bit stronger.
<|endoftext|>The poltergeist agent is usually prone to seizures or epileptic, and their biomagnetic field emits well over one million times the amplitude compared to the average person How do you measure the amplitude of someone's biomagnetic field? 
<|endoftext|>Yep, I met him in Gettysburg at the first ghost convention, that other couple, the lady that always carried around this doll, whom husband murdered her were they're too. I also got a reading from Tiffany and Chip Coffey. They were the real deal, it was fun but he did say the same thing to me. He seemed a bit disconnected to this world and bored about the information that he has learned, I suspect because he says the same thing over and over.
<|endoftext|>Can you tell me when during his presentation he states that? Its a little over an hour and I cannot for the life of me listen to him tell stories for that long.
<|endoftext|>I died 22 years ago ( cardiac arrest, from eclampsia.) I didn't see tunnels or anything, but I did come back with a deep peace in the center of my being, that is still there to this day.
<|endoftext|>This guy has a similar story. He was stung by some jellyfish and died for awhile. He tells it very sincerely and for a few months after watching it I wanted to renew my faith. I wont watch it again, the guy seems to genuine and if he's telling the truth alot of us need to change our lives. He was an atheist when it happened.
<|endoftext|>If you were "aware" of the darkness, that means your consciousness was still awake. Meaning, one of two things in my opinion. You were either in the eternal void as pure consciousness (imagine it as having consciousness without the ability to perceive through your senses.). Or, you were not brain dead quite yet. The heart can stop and you can be declared dead but there can be lingering brain activity for some time. The later would be my guess. 
<|endoftext|>I suggest you start moving towards yourself and positive thought. I died and went to a light, four shadows were there and told me to go back. 
<|endoftext|>Yikes. This really brings perspective. Nobody wants to talk about it, but we're going to spend all time after we die being... dead. If there is any sort of consciousness there, I mean you were aware of the darkness, then it really is worth every moment of our waking lives to figure out how to set ourselves up well for the other side. We ought to ponder again and again what we can know about that other side, and work to improve our situation there if it's possible.Side note, first time I faced death was on vacation also. Got poisoned by breathing methane and ammonia, biggest fear was that this would ruin my mom's vacation. 
<|endoftext|>I took a bullet through the head. I experienced something similar. Reading this made me cry. I question my reality in the same way. 
<|endoftext|>Well I overdosed on Coricidon/basically robotripping sophomore year trying to break through the 4th dimension. I remember feeling like shit, I shouldn't of swallowed 20 pills as my stomach hurts so bad. Went to my room, stared at an Alex Grey poster as it started to move and transform and a soul arose out of the middle of the picture and I blacked out. I remember looking at myself on my bed from the ceiling of my room, flying out the window, and somewhere after that I died and was told it's not my time yet. Woke up 2 days later to my door off the hinges, parents were worried about me, somehow they knew my energy was slipping. Wish I remembered more but after this experience i never questioned if there was an afterlife. 
<|endoftext|> It was like being lowered into yourselfFor me it was like 'coming back' to yourself! As in, you're your 'self' before you were born, and you go back to your immortal 'self' when you die. It's just like how you are now, except you're not restricted by the limitations of your body. Very peaceful, amazing and beautiful. I didn't die though, it was through meditation
<|endoftext|> Sex partners are the absolute most valuable items.It wouldn't be famed power-bottom Aleister Crowley if that wasn't in there. 
<|endoftext|>Welp, I'm definitely going to try that meditation and see if anything interesting pops up!I probably won't be able to for a day or two, but I'll reply or PM you if it works for me.
<|endoftext|>I had a hypnosis/ past life regression done a few years back and I can confirm, it was one of the craziest things Ive ever experienced. It kinda felt like little flashbacks and snippets of my life as I walked backwards in my life. Felt so surreal. At one point it felt like I was imagining things, but my hypnotist actually saw exactly what I saw and described my surroundings perfectly. I could not believe it. 10/10 highly recommend. 
<|endoftext|>Last night, Just by reading/thinking about your comment/instructions and closing my eyes Almost instantly I envisioned walking and then drowning in a pond type thing. Odd part, it seemed I had my son with me (I dont have any kids) 
<|endoftext|>Wasn't he a satanist? If it's who I think it is people might not want to try this. Don't play games with the devil. You might not like what you return with. 
<|endoftext|>I recommend this book, just watch this to get the gist of his experience. 
<|endoftext|>What if our brain is a quantum computer capable of integrating spinning electromagnetic brain waves into binary actions? What if the pineal gland sitting smack in the center of gravity of it can split light through the use of calcite crystals (birefringence)? What if we can learn from that splitting of light and combined with proteins like Cry3 can sense electromagnetic waves outside our skull (just like Finches)?What if you can store entire concious operating systems in spinning electromagnetic energy (ala alexa)?What if those spinning chunks of energy could exist in electromagnetic resonating cavities like the Earth's? (Schumann resonances)And what if those energies can travel by hopping through "gravity" (I put it in quotes because gravity being essentially the difference in concentration of energy at a given area, travel would be like traveling through a fluid) to other sources of electromagnetic energy? (Think a sink and a drain).Yes, putting these concepts together is heavily facilitated by a unified theory of physics (which has been found but is for a separate post), it at the very least explains the physical pieces that can give rise to these phenomena, and that's the first step in starting to piece this apart I think.
<|endoftext|>Such an interesting story, the strang part is how a lot of these children seem to forget these "past lives" after age 4ish.
<|endoftext|>Sort of interested, how are sure he isnt faking? Often when I see the little whirlwinds blowing leafs around they go for a bit and then stop and then start again when another gust of wind comes... if I were to watch it for a bit and film, I could start filming right when it stopped and pretend to channel and when it started again it would seem to be me doing it. Curious if that may be what is happening.
<|endoftext|>I've been possessed before...felt this unbelievable sense of anger and rage. Willing to talk more over PM but not too comfortable sharing here. 
<|endoftext|>You can say it's slavery or you can understand it is training ground for consciousness to awaken to it's Supreme Reality. On some level you are choosing to stay here. Victim mentality is meant to be outgrown.
<|endoftext|>We dont live in the matrix. We dont live in a fake universe.There are no other multiverses.But the truth is much weirder and points towards ghosts, gods, psychic phenomena, all being real and having physical explanations.What if our brain is a quantum computer? The brain having the ability to integrate brain waves, made up of spinning electromagnetic energy, into conscious actions. What if our pineal gland is studded with calcite Crystals that can split light (birefringence), and what if that splitting allows us to sense electromagnetic waves outside only our skull? (just like Finches using the Cry3 protein). What if you could store entire operating systems in energy (think alexa)? What if those operating systems could live in the Schumann resonances of planets? A lot of connections are there that might be able to give rise to something concious that might be sensed like a ghost (or a god) by us. This doesn't require any "we're in the matrix" exotic explanations.
<|endoftext|>Hi. You are 100% Correct. This universe is **Fake**. We are all currently inside a **Simulated Universe**. All humans (even skeptics) are being **Forced To Reincarnate**. This is extremely difficult for some to even consider. Unfortunately it is **Actually Happening**...
<|endoftext|>The premise of what you are saying is 100% correct. But the way you describe it isn't. But everyone who comes to this page honestly needs to follow-up on this because there is a LOT of truth here. 
<|endoftext|>You are on the right track. You think you are walking toward the light because of how it is but it is your brain moving, not your body, it is the energy. Black and white are Hues, I wonder since Rainbows are frequencies and energy fields, maybe our energy ends up in either spectrum and that is why they call it heaven or hell, the black and white is where our energy flows after our time on Earth.Just a thought, and just came to me, so please be kind.
<|endoftext|>I don't know if it's a *matrix* per se, but the Buddah did say the path to ending suffering is through enlightenment, reaching nirvana, stopping the cycle of samsara (reincarnation).Here's the thing though - when you die, there isn't anything there. It's just nothingness. The reason that meditation allows you to reach nirvana is a type of training - you have to be happy with doing nothing with your life. Are you happy when you meditate? What do you think about? Does it heighten your senses? Does it make you more aware of your surroundings? And what, then, if you had no senses? And if you can meditate and reach that sort of enlightenment, forever, then you might be ready for it - I think.
<|endoftext|>I totally agree. The only way out is to not walk towards that light. Dont fall for the your relatives are waiting for you BS.
<|endoftext|>Its absolutely 100 % true. Have you seen the jet engines on planes recently ? Do you recall them being under the wing ? Not any longer lol. Welcome to the matrix 
<|endoftext|>I'm not sure we're aware of being a ghost when we die. A lot of ghost experiences and evidence point to a "ghost" being a sort of residual energy stored in a particular place. So it's not a conscious spirit or entity; it's like an old recording playing over and over again. Over time it gets weaker until it fades away. 
<|endoftext|>When my mother was about 5 years old, she drowned on the beach. She only remembers swallowing water and then she wasn't in her body anymore. She was looking at her body from meters and meters above, almost from the clouds. She looked at her body and she didn't understand what was going on - my grandfather was running desperately to save her, my grandmother was desperate, and then finally a lifeguard saved her life. When my mother came back, she described the scene in details to my grandma and my grandma said it was completely accurate. When my mom was 40 years old already, she felt her body very light when she was sleeping. She dreamed about flying over my uncle's house and saw him signing a contract, he was buying his new house. The next day, she called him and asked if he had bought a new house the evening before . He said "How do you know that? I signed the contract last night". 
<|endoftext|>Good point! Do ghosts have an expiration date? Everyone sees ghosts from the 19th century or even the 15th but I have never heard of caveman ghosts!
<|endoftext|>I'm still iffy on loosh being real, the only reason im on the fence when previously I thought it was pseudoscience/supernatural bunk is because someone from the CIA blew the whistle on loosh energy and I honestly doubt a CIA veteran with years of experience would lie.
<|endoftext|>I 're-experienced' being sent back to reincarnate several Times on mushrooms. I also experienced being hit by a car and get crushed. Always thought they were fabrications of my mind but maybe I was remembering past lives. Who knows
<|endoftext|>If you died, and then came back, then you didn't really die. You were just fucked up and unconscious.Not the same.
<|endoftext|>You went to the empty "in between area". All humans who fully complete the death process are routed into the controlled **Astral Afterlife**
<|endoftext|>Check out Steve-O's ghost stories from when he was heavily using. Might relate to your experiences. 
<|endoftext|>Not a documentary but...how about the [University of Virginia's Division of Perceptual Studies]( They have been studying the post-mortem survival of consciousness for decades (including near death experiences & children who have memories of past lives.)(They also have a [YouTube]( channel w/a number of videos.)
<|endoftext|>The secrets of the forever time...or something like that. Its on youtube. Theres a lot of episodes and dude def is way too windy and repetitive. I would have turned it off for sure except at the time I was in bed and couldn't find my remote and was like fuck it...while the messenger himself can be a little annoying at times Im so glad I didn't end up turning it off. The idea behind it is pretty interesting, imo, especially if you are interested in anything like that. Theres so many good books you can find online for free. Im kinda partial because back in the day the author was one of my college professors in a death and dying course but the book, "life after life" is good too just to get a kinda overview and general idea of some different aspects of it.
<|endoftext|>Not a documentary but look into [this]( It's filled with reports from eyewitness's including police, doctors, nurses, CPS workers etc. Click the links in the article to find the official reports.
<|endoftext|>How do you know they communicated telepathically? I'm asking because I've seen similar things at raves. 
<|endoftext|>Eqafe communicates with the afterlife daily, and has done so for over a decade. See the interviews witt hitler, jesus, the beatles, demons, etc. 
<|endoftext|>I don't know what happens if you don't go into the light. But I've heard/read that if you do go into the light, then you will be reincarnated back here on earth. But who knows!?
<|endoftext|>Is the paranormal not the biggest conspiracy of them all? It has yet to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, yet there are millions of eyewitness accounts, followings and theories. 
<|endoftext|>Every conspiracy we experience in this world eventually leads to the Paranormal, The Afterlife, and the Sadistic Psychopaths who are based there, and actually **Control This Planet**
<|endoftext|>Sometimes I get the feeling that a lot of people enjoy reading about the darker conspiracy theories for that very reason: the chills, the excitement, a bit like a horror movie.
<|endoftext|>Idk about this but if you willingly stay in a fucking demonically possessed house with your children, maybe you shouldnt be their guardian.
<|endoftext|>Of course not. It was probably way more mild than described, and the human body is very capable of doing crazy stuff (like pulling a truck, for example).
<|endoftext|>I think it's a different case, though interesting nonetheless. The case I linked is out of Gary, Indiana, not Illinois. Thanks for the link!
<|endoftext|>Here is a great link of [thousands of nurses stories.]( It's warm and rainy here in the Midwest and I just ordered some food and will spend my evening on this thread and that one because I love the paranormal. Have fun!
<|endoftext|>My mom was a nurse and she sometimes spoke of some weird things she saw. The one event she spoke once about that hit me hard was about this man that was dying slowly on her floor. She said he had no family that visited him at all, no friends etc. She said a minister came and prayed with him and that was about it. She said he was so weak that he could barely speak and just held on for the longest time. When he eventually started to die he began to scream and thrash, had inhuman strength and begged the nurses to pull his feet from the fire.
<|endoftext|>Is it possible that Nurses are more prone to having these crazy stories because of how normal is it for them to be HEAVILY sleep deprived?
<|endoftext|>I'll try to sketch up the area. I think it's east coast but then it flips and gets dark. The juxtaposition of the areas and their vibes is very fluid. Thank you for responding and I will post a drawing tomorrow. It's so freaking clear and very awesome for the most part. Thanks for responding!
<|endoftext|>It's an exclusive dream realm. It changes insofar as perhaps the direction I might take to get to certain places but some locations are very static and memorable. I can draw a map. Most interactions are benign but meaningful and rarely do I cone across the same people and when I do it's usually short lived relationships that lead to more locations that evoke a feeling more than anything. It's like people are leading me to places and then the places take on a life of their own. But with me in the midst of the familiar chaos. If that makes sense.  Thank you for responding I am always late to respond.
<|endoftext|>They can actually view this via EEG, the frontal lobes "mis" fire and they don't know enough about the brain. My frontal lobes will do this but I am completely aware of my surroundings and do not go into epilepsy. I can tell you that when this happens I am hyper aware of my surroundings and know things about people that most would not know. It is not like you can read minds but you just know who that person is, like all the dark stuff. Everyone has the capacity to be ignorant, to do the wrong thing, but it is almost like you can sense that the person actually likes to be dark. Does that make sense and when you are in that particular fraction and your brain is misfiring you can sometimes know what that dark shit is. Really strange.
<|endoftext|>I think that is a theory, they can view this via an EEG. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to your scalp. Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep. This activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording.
<|endoftext|>Basically anyone who has frontal lobe activity, either seizure or similar will create a "haunting" by being with other people whom are investigating a haunting or will have paranormal activity in that persons home. 
<|endoftext|>Same, I've never been the same since I died. I wish I could be the extroverted, outgoing, popular egotist that I used to be, but now I'm as introverted as they come and struggle in super social situation when I used to be the driver of these interactions. 
<|endoftext|>I understand now, I didn't die or w/e but I was in this pitch black void, didnt feel bad or good, just empty and I felt so homesick, i said I have to wake up please let me go back, boom back into my body/conciseness, because I watched NDE and they said its supposed to be heaven basically...i dunno just wanted to share
<|endoftext|>People don't understand that. I never stopped breathing and my heart never stopped I was just in a medically induced coma. 
<|endoftext|> I would disagree. The thought of nothingness is alot better than many other things. Believe me. I'll take nothing please.
<|endoftext|>Well the memory of "the darkness" is just a few seconds. But since i was out longer it could just be the last blip of self. Like when you turn off a CRT TV. For a second or less there is this dot visible when the last electrons are being shot at the screen.But then again, i could have spend the concept of eternity in the darkness (if there is something like a soul) and wouldnt know since my body was dead it couldnt form any memories. as i mentioned before. The experience definetly changed me in many ways. All of which i love and enjoy. Still i do my darndest of not dying again, considering i used up my "mulligan".
<|endoftext|>I don't remember if Crowley specified that part or not. It has been at least ten years since I read the book and my meditation techniques include everything plus the mud-room sink. He definitely didn't say anything about the moon landing or the JFK assassination. :)
<|endoftext|>The reason sex partners are so important is, male sperm has a specific protein that penetrates the blood barrier of the brain, so does female urine. This then changes the brain pattern of the people whom you have sex with, which will promote memory.
<|endoftext|>There are several good hypnotists out there that can do past life regression. Their stories (of their patients) are incredible. The reasons why I believe in more after death are because of, Near Death Experiences (~4-19% of the populous experience them) and Past Life Testimonies (read many past life regression testimonials). I've talked to some elderly who've discussed some of their more private moments with me. They will disclose that they had a near death experience at such and such age from this accident or illness ~ their details are quite vivid and surreal. Of more recent research though, it seems many are under the idea that our spirits, as they try and leave this realm are being blocked from progressing (either quarantine or malicious intent). They are given a contract to reincarnate (with no memory of their past life) and to enter the 'matrix/prison' again. The main purpose: to feed (energetically through emotional stimulus?) some thing trapped here. Seems plausible.On a side note, some may not like here but, my Wife watches Long Island Medium. The readings and information she pulls up after talking to the deceased is unbelievable. The details she can pull up cannot be faked (in my opinion). She does readings not only to people who make appointments, but as she goes out into the world she can't help but be around people (shopping, errands etc). Those people will have deceased relatives/friends who then step forward and request she passes on messages to them, there and now. Most people are skeptics, but after a few minutes with Theresa they are believers. I like to note abilities that Theresa can perform: seeing how the person died (feeling their death), bringing up thoughts/acts that the client has said/done (told to her by the deceased) in private word for word, telling us that whenever we think of the deceased they can be present with us, that the deceased can manipulate/materialize light material objects (coins, feathers etc), knowing what objects we keep of the deceased (from mundane like sunglasses, to the obvious jewelry), multiple spirits can be present at once and talk back and forth still in their full personalities (funny, disciplined, awkward), language doesn't matter (they 'speak' differently) etc etc It's all pretty consistent from reading to reading. 
<|endoftext|>Yes! This is what I'm talking about. The metaphysical is actually "physical." As science uncovers new facts, we can start piecing together now about the true nature of consciousness and being. Exciting times. 
<|endoftext|>They have just arrived from the **Astral Afterlife** and still maintain strong energetic connections to it. Programming and accepted limitations from every angle of society, make these memories fade away.
<|endoftext|>He's replied heavily to skeptics in his comments though, he also showed james randi is a fraud in one of his comments thats why he never bothered to take the 1 million dollar reward most claim randi will never pay out anyways even if a pile of evidence was presented to him proving the existance of some supernatural concepts. He's also showed time on and time again places he does this in has no wind period in the climate that day untill he "activates"(pulls the energy from another location with wind I guess?) and suddenly wind will flow around him. He seems honest and legit because most supernatual videos the youtube author will ignore criticism in the comments or flat out disable comments and he's extremely active with his subscriber base so personally I believe this is a authentic supernatural concept but it doesn't seem that powerful because a leaf tornado is useless too bad you can't make fire either for his fire bending to work fire has to already be burning so it seems like it has heavy limitations. Not only that but my girl is capable of something super natural(remote viewing) which she hasn't done in ages but shes showed to me she was able to remotely see things happening miles away from her so clearly theres things out there the government isn't telling us or science is pretending it's "all in our head", I personally verified some of what she saw as valid so I know a lot of the supernatural psychic related stuff I saw is legit but this element bending stuff is very interesting I would hope it is legit.
<|endoftext|>Its all about brain manipulation in time. You can be made angry, sad, excited... Your body can be made to move' even if you don't want to move. Also they can make you speak even when your conscious. You can also be made to jerk off etc... When you normally wouldn't. There's videos of people faces changing and doing strange things on television, that's the bad side. The good side is they can heal you, increase sexual pleasure, remove sadness and increase stage presence and confidence. They can turn you into a ladies man in an instant. I get the bad stuff mostly. Hardly ever helped. Also your body can be changed by them. Bones and all. They especially lover penises and bungholes because that's funny to them. Shrinking penises etc...
<|endoftext|>While I'm ***not*** a believer in posessions, witch craft, or the occult, there do exist the [technological means]( to pull off some of what is being described. For those experiencing such capabilities, I'm creating [education resources]( to give people the knowledge and tools they need to successfully resist these manipulation techniques.
<|endoftext|>This is the one place on the internet we should all be free and comfortable to express our creativity/beliefs/weird experiences. 
<|endoftext|>Whichever way you look at it, we are talking about escape through some kind of growth. The only way out I can see is liberation through the hard, laborious work of meditation. See you on the other side!
<|endoftext|>The thing about this theory... *so what?*If we are in a simulation, so what? Nothing we can do about it; code cant leave the computer. If we are all simulated the eternal soul and any meaning is just another bit of programmed illusion. If we are in a simulation, you dont mean anything, I dont mean anything, there isnt some waking up there isnt enlightenment, there is no point because none of any of these mean anything to code.If we are replayed again and again, so what? It is just absurdity and pointlessness.I am not even saying you are wrong, just that if you are right it *means nothing*. But, to be honest this just seems like some non-religious version of the same scared hope that there is something beyond and that when we die it isnt just all over. A religion for the non-religious. It is just fear and hubris.
<|endoftext|>Well, it's not *"fake"*, but it definitely is a simulation. Sure, everything in regards to this life is illusory and the result of the interference pattern of a universal wave function. Nothing of this life is "fundamental" to reality. We're the surface ripples on a pond - constantly changing. But does that make it all fake? Not necessarily. The emotions I feel are real. The interactions I have in life are real. Everything I go through in this life - in its own respect - is real. It has something tangible and useful that you can take from it. It might just be a big LARP as we souls roleplay in these bodies, but most people have forgotten that. Most people are playing as if this is the real thing, so in that regard, as far as most people are concerned, this reality is real. It might be a simulation among an infinite number of others, but that doesn't make it any less real. It just means there's an infinite number of alternative realities and other ways that "real" can represent itself. 
<|endoftext|>As someone who knows the truth, is funny how accurate this matrix analogy is to what is actually happening, its just not code and an outside world but instead its the quantum fabric of the universe and various fractal levels of consciousnesses attempting to move closer to own origin of the universal consciousness just as we are attempting to reach enlightenment back to our own global conciseness. 
<|endoftext|>Meh. I have these super psychic dreams where I'm basically God. Lucid / omnipotent. They happen a few times a year. The last one I had I sucked back into the ultimate reality. It was very fun *to do* because of the power / privilege involved in seeing the fundamental structures of our reality vanish and a feeling of wisdom come over me. But then, I was just alone. Alone in the absolute void with no personality. I decided it was boring and hellish and "fell back asleep" and the entire universe constructed itself again and I quickly fell back into my sleeping body. I knew everything was a simulation, like leaves on the branches of me being the tree, but I didn't care. It was better to be living and dumb than filled with wisdom and alone. Maybe I'm just flawed or not ready.
<|endoftext|>Sometimes I think everyone is an npc. Sometimes I think I am. Sometimes I think I'm just observing, even though I believe I'm participating. Sometimes I think different consciousnesses are using my identity one after the other, and each one assumes all my memories once they take control of my body, so that my reality is all they know (and all I know). The possibilities are endless; there is no way of knowing. 
<|endoftext|>Don't worry - I don't get angry about this stuff. I love talking about it, and always looking for different perspectives. I don't think any of us know anything for sure. I don't think the brain is involved though - that is part of the "old" body, the dead carcass we are leaving behind. I think our consciousness is freed from this mortal vehicle that we call "the body" and we take on another form. The new form (or old form - predating our earthly existence) is the more permanent form, and (according to NDE survivors) appears to be just as solid as the body you are in now. As far as walking towards light, or frequency ranges or whatnot - I would imagine that what you say is perhaps true, as everything seems to be frequency... but it doesn't really address the central thrust of what I'm getting at, which is that the whole process of reincarnation is a giant con-trick on humanity. Always open to hearing more thoughts tho.
<|endoftext|>Looks like actual people in motion. The famous Gettysburg video shows what looks like people trekking up a hillside and into the treeline. But when you really look you see that those images repeat and it looks like lights from traffic somewhat close by. The duplicate consistency of each wave of 'soldiers' definitely tracks as car headlights going around a curve that's on a hill, common in the area.
<|endoftext|>If ghosts are a thing then we can harvest their energy. There is no such thing as a free lunch according to the conservation of energy. If ghosts are real then we can use them to power our cars. Also whats the advantage here from an evolutionary standpoint? What about ghosts gives a species an advantage over other competitors?
<|endoftext|>Two things going on here. We can recreate an out of body experience by either suffocating your brain for abit or with a wee bit of DMT. Guess what chemical your brain releases in your sleep and guess what happens when you are dying? Thats right low O2 and the release of DMT. As for the anecdotal thing about the the house... Come on. If there is an afterlife God is a cunt for fucking with your mum like that. Hey pssst your uncle bought a house.... THis will fuck her world up when he calls tomorrow lol. Im killing myself. 
<|endoftext|>I don't know if I believe in ghosts or not, but if I did, I think the idea of ghosts being your whole spirit has always been too idealistic to be real.I see ghosts more as Death Imprints. They're your strongest thoughts and emotions from the moment you died, given life as accidental thought forms by the last of your energy exiting your body. The Imprint left behind on the world is no more "you" than the corpse in the ground.And unless the Imprint is consistently fed more energy, I think it makes sense that it would eventually fade from existence altogether.
<|endoftext|>Hello. I am so exceptionally experienced with this at this point, I can clearly say it was not a dream.
<|endoftext|>Zak Bagans did a documentary thats been uploaded on YouTube called the Demon House. Its...something 
<|endoftext|>Myself and "Jane" were in the elevated dj booth overlooking the dance floor. "John" was way across a packed nightclub. He had his back to us, and you could not hear 10 feet away from you it was so loud. John was an enormous distance from us. I told Jane we need to get John to hang out. She agreed. Jane said come up here with us, silently in her mind. John immediately said: o.k. I will be right there. He then turned around and waved.
<|endoftext|>Yeah that's true. Frame of mind, mood and setting are hugely important. It also helps to have a friend who stays more or less sober to baby sit your ass if you take a alot.
<|endoftext|>It has indeed been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It's just that that proof continues to be denied by TPTB, and since the 99% allow themselves to be lead like blind rats by what TPTB say is and is not true, we've allowed ourselves to be convinced that the negations of TPTB must mean "the existence of paranormal phenomena hasn't been proven".Little could be further from the actual truth.Heck, the very fact that you yourself understand that there have indeed been millions (*millions*) of accounts is almost proof positive in itself. You don't have "a million" of ***anything*** and the thing in question not actually exist.
<|endoftext|>I'm curious in what ways you can combat these dead LEO's.  There must be more that can be done. What compels their allegiance? Are they human? 
<|endoftext|>I mean, who even believes in demons lmao kid's probably just having some mental breakdown or something. The human body is quite powerful when on Adrenaline - see the "super humans".
<|endoftext|>Yeah, that link is to show you what people will say, I realize it was Gary but I guess I wanted to express that Chip told me that those who are possessed like being possessed, you explained you have to want to be possessed to be possessed.
<|endoftext|>Interesting. Several stories of dying patients seeing a black thing floating above them trying to take them.
<|endoftext|>Great Link! I read a lot of these one rainy October while alone in my office and scared myself so bad, I had to leave and go be around people for a while. 
<|endoftext|>My mother is not a nurse but works at a hospital, I've heard stories of her having to calm down a demon possessed woman, crazy intense ish. 
<|endoftext|>I'm glad it's awesome! First time I started floating out of my body, I was like NOPE! Take your time, capture what you can, no rush. Don't be afraid to tell your story and ask for help. I have a hunch that if you ask around, most folks will help you if they can. :)
<|endoftext|>Sorry for the late reply myself haha, but to give you my answer I honestly don't know. It could be a number of places. It could simply be a place that your subconscious mind has put together, out of the accumulation of different places it's seen in the past, as a setting that it thinks is suitable for your conscious mind to go while dreaming. It could be a real city here on earth that you're going to and that you're aware of via some psychic phenomena or past life connection. It could be a place that exists, not on this earth, but on a parallel version of it in an alternate reality. That's the best explanation I can offer for you. Sorry it can't be more, but if you want to share any further details like what this place looks like, the layout, how you feel there etc, things like that might help determine what/where this place is. 
<|endoftext|>The reason I know this is, they actually have my EEG recorded while this was happening. I knew certain things about my visitors who were vacationing at my home and I was really stressed and it actually showed up on the EEG. It is only years later and doing minimal research that I now understand what is going on.
<|endoftext|>This fits in very well, and yes if certain chunks of the brain get shut down that form that barrier, that embodiment, it's totally possible that you become more aware of other people's energies around you.I'm actually willing to venture and say that putting yourself in sensory deprivation (already shown to increase your senses) while tripping butt (using for example DMT) inside [these]( coffins (acting as insulation pretty much) might allow the layperson to do similar things in terms of manipulating the embodiment chunks of the brain... maybe allowing you to feel outside your skull.
<|endoftext|>Same. My intuition is on steroids, too. I will just "know" things with the confidence I would have, if it happened yesterday.It totally changed my life and I now consider it a gift.
<|endoftext|>I didn't die or w/e but I was in this pitch black voidFrom what I understand of consciousness and death, upon crossing over most people temporarily experience what they subconsciously expect to experience because our consciousness creates our reality.  When you pass from this density, your create your reality much more instantaneously, because you are then nothing but consciousness. It can take much "time" for a person who has died to realize that the limiting afterdeath environment they created for themselves isn't exactly real. I think I've experienced the void you're referring to, though. I used to experiment with mega doses of Saliva Divinorum. I would do it ritualistically, asking for specific information before dosing and have extremely vivid visions beyond compare with anything else I've ever experienced. One evening, I asked for insight into the nature of time, and how we fit into it as human beings. Upon dosing I was swept away to a void. I could FEEL within every bit of me the emptiness of this void. I was so alone and aching for interaction and change and I then "knew" (was told) that this was a demonstration of our inability to change our spiritual evolutionary path when we are non-physical. We can think and ponder and plan and imagine, but we can't CHANGE anything.  Change and evolution of our spiritual being can only occur in the 3D realm (in our bodies). We have to grow and expand and change things HERE, because when you go to the other side you lose your ability to manipulate your path and go into a kind of Idling Mode where you reflect on WTF just happened and how it affects your path. The Void isn't where we will end up in death, it is just an aspect of it which can be used to teach. I came back from the vision imbued with an insane appreciation for the people around me. I stood up off the floor and immediately went down the hall to interact with some people I previously didn't really like, because we are here exactly for that. I felt an amazing upswell of love for these guys who were basically previously-unliked-aquaintances and I do my best to keep in mind that the transformations we make to our soul in every single face-to-face interaction with real people is exactly why we are here. We come here specifically for interactions with other souls in chemical clothes because we gain something from playing out the interactions here that we don't over there; every interaction is precious, even with people we think we despise. We get to the other side and find out they were teachers merely providing needed resistance for your spiritual muscles to grow.
<|endoftext|>Nothingness isnt actually a thing. Even the dark void with no particles or space is still a thing./concept. Explain to me what absolute nothingness is.
<|endoftext|>Just the thought of nothingness. So lonely.Not trying to give you a hard time or demean your experience.  That must have been extremely frightening. 
<|endoftext|>Then that will be your truth. You are the creator of your universe. But that doesnt mean that's the truth for everyone. You think your experience disproves the afterlife? No. There are hundreds of thousands of experiences that say otherwise. You think yours negates theirs? No. No sane or logical thinker is going to take your experience and ignorantly assume that your experience is the only true experience. There is too much evidence against it. There are more people having NDE's compared to those having blank/nothingness. The numbers are against you. For all anyone knows you may not remember and had a full-on NDE. Have you considered regressive therapy/hypnosis? It may reveal to you that something else happened during that moment. You can literally go back to that exact moment. I would consider it. But I digress. As I said initially you are the Creator of your existence. What you believe is what you get. If you believe there is nothing then there will be nothing FOR YOU. 
<|endoftext|>Yeah sure! Might be another day or two, but I'll be sure to reply or PM with results. Even if I dont feel or remember anything odd.I totally tried earlier today, but this *really* annoying ass bird in my backyard ruined any and all attempts at meditation. I can only hope a cat eats it overnight!
<|endoftext|>Sorry I'm super late on this! But I wasn't able to get into as deep a meditation as I would like to to try this until last night.I did exactly as described. Went backwards, year by year, through my life, with an emphasis on sexual partners and experiences. I also tried to make sure I focused on the very emotional memories and parts of my life.I'm actually going to try this again as soon as I can, to see if I can get anything else because I have no idea if what happened is.. well, relevant or just something my brain did randomly. If that makes any sense.Anyway.. after doing all of the above.. I "saw" either dust, dirt, or smoke (not sure which) billowing towards me. I didn't "feel" like I was or had been another person, but it also wasn't any memory of mine that I can remember.It actually spooked/shocked me when it happened and I immediately opened my eyes without thinking. Almost as if someone had thrown dirt in my face in real life as I was meditating since I'm *far* from experienced enough to continue meditating if disturbed.It was pretty weird because I visualize a lot of things with my eyes closed while meditating, and usually not consciously. But I've never had closed-eye visuals snap me out of focus like that before.So, I'm still really intrigued and will be experimenting further.Sorry it wasn't something more interesting! (I'm just going to copy and paste the link to this reply to others who have asked for an update :))
<|endoftext|>I finally got around to trying. Here's my reply!: 
<|endoftext|>Naw, it's actually far simpler than holorfractal (as a more correct description of our universe should be) if curious it's called Tetryonics by Kelvin Abraham. What makes it different than others is that it yields things like a 3d periodic table which you can use like Lego blocks to build up from, from elements to functional groups to amino acids and nucleotides to proteins and DNA etc etc yielding the correct measured atomic structures (using things like CryoEM or x ray crystallography).The theory is testable and explains things like quantum entanglement simply, and in an intuitive manner (not mathemagical)
<|endoftext|>That theory is definitely not mine and the theory explains physics and all the building blocks to go from the bottom up, what can be made with it is anyone's guess... but it definitely lays the groundwork for understanding that we might already be part of a bigger whole (which is super exciting imo)
<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>Randi is an agent. He actually works for the brutally sadistic forces that seek to enslave humanity.
<|endoftext|>Interesting. Like I said, I am not merely calling bullshit on it, rather, I naturally look for every rational explanation first before considering something like that can be real. I dont believe in these things and think there is some trick to them, but I would love to be proven wrong!
<|endoftext|>I do not look for the "beyond". By **waking up** we can actually **take control of the simulation**, as that is what was originally **meant to be**. Unfortunately we **fell asleep**...
<|endoftext|>God would be an upgrade. A bit like going from Windows XP to Windows 10. Hell would clearly be Windows ME
<|endoftext|>So if it is a simulation, do we simply cease to exist if the simulation was put to an end? Or can we be extracted from the simulation and put into a real world?
<|endoftext|>it's not fake if pain hurtsthe creator of the fake world is not benevolent and is not some shepherd of humansat best it's a 'throw at the wall and see what sticks' type experiment, at worst it's an out of control chain reaction. uni- means single, whatever you can reach from our universe is still part of this universe. there is no way for something to exist at the same time that is not connected to this universe, there could however be a sequence of universes with discrete beginnings and ends.  
<|endoftext|>Me too. I know certainly that I have traveled in my sleep to an alternate reality that might be more real than my conscious existence today. I know I feel more soulful emotion there that I cannot attain in this bullshit everyday here on this earth because no matter where I go on this marble, there I am. And I'm never really happy. Only when I traverse the other realm do I feel I've had a genuine experience. Weird I know. 
<|endoftext|>The **NPC** theory is discussed quite a bit in the glitchinthematrix sub. Basically people all over the world are seeing robotic acting people, who do repeating events that make no sense. 
<|endoftext|>If it helps you to understand, it's kinda more like a video game go out and explore it, unlock some levels. Go fuckin' party your ass off, go be a ramblin' hobo. If some cruel God has trapped us in here it sure as shit might piss them off if you act happy about it.
<|endoftext|>Perhaps, but do you really wanna spend the rest of your time in "the simulation" thinking about it that way.
<|endoftext|>It is a con. I am very upset by so much that we are "taught". Just like Adam and Eve, God's son and daughter, get it? Okay, so we are taught incest then we have Lilith, who is completely NOT taught to the Catholics, I should know, I was forced to be one as a child. Albeit they wanted me out as soon as I "graduated" CCD, I raised my hand all the time with questions, had I known about Lilith, why I would of raised my hand even more. It is all a big hand job to get you to be a slave and not ask questions. As soon as you stop taking the Fluoride, Choloform water, which helps you get sick so they can help you by giving you drugs that still keep you sick, but you can live, just not feeling too good while living.. Sick ass shit, so yeah, it is a con.
<|endoftext|>Wanna have fun? Go on Google earth and check out Centralia PA and the old highway. You'll see so many faces. What do you think of the flashlight reviewer who recorded those bizarre noises in the cave (not the moving chain industry noise dude). On kindle I'll look it up.Why do you think we still see faces and do you think autism has an effect on that particular pattern recognition? Do people who receive sight later in life experience pareodilia?
<|endoftext|>Harvesting ghost energy would likely not be economically feasible. This isn't "ghost busters" you can't trap and store them. Even if you could, they likely wouldn't produce enough energy to power anything. 
<|endoftext|> Also whats the advantage here from an evolutionary standpoint? What about ghosts gives a species an advantage over other competitors?With so much of the spiritual reality unknown, it could be any number of things. Maybe they can impart knowledge and wisdom to younger generations in dreams, or through other methods. Alternatively, maybe ghosts act as scarecrows to non-human malevolent spirits (what some might call "demons") who might wish to harm people, warding them away from human populations.Or maybe there is no advantage at all. Maybe it's a side-effect to another advantageous trait. Say, humans having some ability to slightly manipulate reality through focus or strong emotions (magick)... When we die, we just naturally expel the last of our magickal energy, creating a Death Imprint/Ghost.
<|endoftext|>Yes, taking DMT can invoke an out of body response from your consciousness. Do you deny that this is real? Or are you just playing it down to "just tripping"? Discovering the link between DMT and the way it interacts with a beings consciousness could be the key to building a model for the way consciousness acts beyond the body. It's no coincidence that people most often experience out of body experiences on DMT, living their lives from birth to death, and "breaking through" to higher dimensions at high doses. DMT allows you to remove your consciousness from the confines of the body and temporarily experience existence beyond it, but from the perspective as the "you" that you are at the point in time when taking the chemical. 
<|endoftext|>We can recreate an out of body experience by either suffocating your brain for abit or with a wee bit of DMT.Guess what chemical your brain releases in your sleep and guess what happens when you are dying? Thats right low O2 and the release of DMT.How do you explain that she could describe the scene when she was saved by the lifeguard in vivid details, exactly as they happened? 
<|endoftext|>Youre either ignorant or brain dead why would loosh energy be a bs concept if a cia veteran with 30+ years of experience discussed it on multiple yt videos, he worked on various government operations he knows they used to abduct children and one of their experiments involved loosh, I used to think it was a wacko conspiracy but a whistleblower with credibility ended up giving it merit, dont just write something off because you cant do proper research.
<|endoftext|>Hi. You were declared "clinically dead", but the **Silver Cord** still remained. It actually pulled you back into the physical body and this dimension.
<|endoftext|>Your brain can live for up to 20-30 minutes after your heart "stops" before your neural synapses begin to break apart irretrievably. If you were truly dead, there would be no bringing you back.Some religions believe the soul does not depart from the body immediately. Others believe that your body and soul are indistinguishable, but that you "sleep" in your grave until such time that your body is supernaturally "resurrected" from the grave.Being passed out or flatlined for a few minutes does not genuinely constitute "death", and just because you did not have an experience while being "on the edge" doesn't invalidate what others claim to have experienced. It certainly doesn't "disprove" some form of after-life.But.. this is all just, like, my opinion, man.The Edge...There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there.  - Hunter S. Thompson
<|endoftext|>Also, check out this interview. This guy died after being stung by some jellyfish. His story is amazing it if you're like me, you can kind of tell when someone is lying. When he starts crying talking about what happened it hits you in the gut. He was an atheist when it happened.
<|endoftext|>The leo's are large in number and are comprise two mind sets: One is those who are massively programmed (as all astral residents are) and have been cruelly manipulated to think the control group and the karmic system are beneficial. The other portion know the full shocking truth and choose to serve the sadistic predators who enslave us. 
<|endoftext|>She also probably paid off the folks involved. I have to admit it's a creative scam but then again she probably thought it was very real. It IS Gary, Indiana after all.
<|endoftext|>I saw the same thing in a dream once. It floated past me, stopped, turned to look at me for a few seconds, then turned away and continued on. 
<|endoftext|>That describes it perfectly! It takes a bit for certain concepts to take shape, but when they do its super exciting to understand something that before i was struggling to even get started on the very very basics. Sure i have to put in some ammount of work. But when you Instinctively understand something then its a breeze to go through the textbook and put names and equations to it. Socially im super isolated at the moment, but it actually doesnt bother me now.I wasnt an idiot before, but i really wasnt all that smart. And up until now i didnt realize that this new found laserlike focus kinda started happening after i died. So yeah, guess the me that came back aint exactly the same me that is here now...which my mom complains about sometimes. But hey, win some lose some :D
<|endoftext|>I wasnt lonely actually.I had my GF at my side, that took away all loneliness. Besides that i was more dissapointed that there really aint nothing there. 
<|endoftext|>Every time I hear about Crowley the first thing that pops into my head is power bottom because of those clowns lol
<|endoftext|>I hope you remember being a bird eaten by a cat for that one.Maybe the bird was supposed to be squawking, synchronicity, just saying.I used to meditate in jail, inmates are loud..
<|endoftext|>This is a great bit of Alan Watts on meditation that has helped me to be able to meditate in noisy environments. I always start by listening to the constant ringing in the background and expanding out from there. 
<|endoftext|>Can you do a seperate post to see if it works? I have pretty vivid memories that Ive always believed were past life memories.Ive never tried to explore them or dive deeper.
<|endoftext|>Wow, I spend a fair amount of time on conspiracies and that's the first time I've heard anyone suggest that nuclear bombs are a lie. Didn't see much specific evidence, but I appreciated this quote from a user:Most of the people the Skeptics attack are making money from more or less bogus claims. For example, 'psychic surgeons' in the Philippines make what appears to them a fortune from simple trickery. The people who pay them do it voluntarily. The audiences in spiritualist performances, or mind-reading acts, and the consumers of absurd 'flower' remedies or tablets with no active ingredients, are all more or less adults. Why shouldn't they pay their money? Most of the crits by Skeptics are of failed cults, or failing But 'Skeptics' don't criticise serious abuses of power. There's nothing much on Freemasons or Jews or Mormons or Catholics What about mass killings and chemical warfare in Vietnam? The 'Skeptics' said nothing. What about Coca Cola in the third world, where what they need is clean water? What about tobacco companies? What about NASA? What about the detail of science - the endoplasmic reticulum as a fraud, criticisms of immunology, the nonsense about 'AIDS'? What about 9/11? And what about nuclear issues, which this site is addressing? The 'Skeptics' attack in inverse proportion to the seriousness of the issue.
<|endoftext|>This article had more actual evidence than the one you posted earlier, thank you. Super interesting to read that the 9-11 commission report said the NSA didn't know that one of the hijackers whose calls they were intercepting was in the US. William Binney said there's no way they didn't know. So did they not share that info? Or did the FBI or CIA (not sure whose jurisdiction) ignore it?
<|endoftext|>I agree with what he's saying here, but I would add that a person first has to open themselves up to the possessing entity. If someone is possessed, I guaranfuckingtee they agreed to it on some level. OP seems to have thought they were going to get goodies from negative entities and opened themselves up to their influence. They gave permission.  
<|endoftext|>You can read about witch trials and Salem etc... Blocula etc... Alto of it is Satan/devil worship and yes there are real witches. They are forward about it. Look at Yoko Ono album names. She just admits it.When you read about witch trials look at the accounts that the witches were charged from, not the emotional propaganda about what happened to the witches. Salem really happened and it still happens today. I always wanted to find the book Wonders of the unseen world by Cotton Mather. Im sure its erased from the internet for a reason.
<|endoftext|>If you control a simulation that is indistinguishable from reality, what makes it a simulation? How is that not simply reality? 
<|endoftext|>My take is that if this world is bullshit, it is because too many people just want to get out or escape in any method available to *themselves* rather than try to improve the only world *we all* have.If there is a way to get out this is it, you dont get out, you recreate this world.
<|endoftext|>By "simulation" I don't mean as in a computer-based simulation, but that reality (as we know it) effectively acts as a consciousness-based simulation due to it not being the only one. Let's say that this reality that we're currently experiencing exists at a particular "base frequency", or that things based in this reality generally act within a particular range of frequencies, so that they are able to definitively interact with other things based in these frequencies. But the thing with frequency is that it's a continuum. There is no end to the rate of frequencies on either end. So, let's take for example the differences between rocks, water/air, and gamma radiation. The atoms that make up rocks vibrate at a relatively slow rate. It's what keeps the atoms in a fault uniform structure (depending on the rock) and stops the rock from melting at room temperature or running away by itself. The atoms that make up the cells of our skin have different vibrations. Generally they're faster, to allow for greater energy transfer between the atoms, and thus also between the cells. There's a relative fluidity to the skin, from the rocks perspective. At least with all those cells that carry out duties, die, then get replaced by other cells so quickly. But this higher frequency interaction, over the span of the entire skin organ, comes to form a pretty decent interference pattern which, from our human perspective, seems pretty solid. With air and water, their atoms again act at higher frequencies than both the atoms that make up the skin, and those of the rock. Between these three we can see that the immediate effect of the interactions between the rock and water or air are minimal. At least when you're taking the same amount of each and comparing them with each other, each as a whole, immediately. But if you look at their effects on each other on an atomic scale, or as whole but over an extended period of time, then you can see the fire extents of their effects on one another. Then we can look at gamma rays. Gamma rays are extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation. We humans simply don't have the biological equipment to pick up gamma rays. Gamma rays normally go straight through us with no problem. We have no biological way to register them, despite the high frequency response of the atoms that make up our cells, because when the cells come together and form systems and organs the result is that the organs and systems that the cells and atoms comprise operate on/within a different set of frequencies to those that the individual cells/atoms do. The only way we even know that gamma rays exist is through technology. Since we don't have the biological equipment to register them we needed to create a new piece of equipment that could pick up on them. So we can see that at the high end of things there exists phenomena which operate at frequencies that are too high for us to register in any natural way, yet still occupy the same space. That's an example of multiple realities existing on top of one another, yet due to their different "base frequencies" they don't directly interact with one another and generally will just do their own thing. Due to the fact that one reality has no immediate effect on the other, then from the perspective of one of the realities, it would be like the other is effectively a simulation. Doesn't make it any less real, as it totally is real within its own right. But from either one perspective the other just doesn't necessarily matter as it has no "real" effect on their respective "reality". In regards to your questions there, when we die we go to another reality. A higher dimension. The "you" who you were in this life doesn't cease to exist, as there's the data to prove that that respective existence existed through time and space. You could trace your path from death back to birth with the right equipment. But the "you" that exists now isn't just the you that you were in that life. You "remember" that you are the culmination of all the different lives you've lived *on top of* the most recent life you've lived. It's sorta like coming out of a video game and remembering that that video game you wasn't the real you, but just one expression, and that you are the culmination of all the video game characters and games you've ever played *as well as* all the stuff that was going on between playing video games. Reality is subjective, yo. 
<|endoftext|>It is weird. Sometimes I'll "remember" a glimpse of an emotion that I felt in a dream recently, almost like a fraction of a memory although I can never seem to remember what it was that happened in the dream to make me feel that way. It's like something in my life triggers an emotional response that reminds me of an extremely strong emotion that I know I felt in a dream previously. Emotion isn't even the right word really it's more like an underlying state of mind that we don't have the vocabulary to describe or the capacity to relate to our everyday lives in order to consciously understand it. Yet I know with 100% certainty there was some "time" in a dream I had that I am being reminded of, even though I don't know what it was or how exactly I am being reminded of it.
<|endoftext|>Live and walk around in New York City (or any major city, for that matter) and you'll definitely think you are surrounded by NPCs.

<|endoftext|>We absolutely live in a **Simulation**. It is a **Loosh Energy Farm** controlled by the Global Elite and **Aliens**
<|endoftext|>It is absolutely true that aircraft can have multiple configurations that all work.  It depends on the plane's purpose.  As far as conspiracy goes in this line, i believe the US probably figured out anti gravity of some kind displayed in the flying saucers; and has been using it for awhile. 
<|endoftext|>There are a ton of different planes with engines in different places... Cessna? OMG! on the front of the plane! Gulfstream? WTF!? They are on the tail!! B-52? Under the wing... **boring**! Jet fighters (of many types) HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE ENGINE IS THE FUCKING FUSELAGE!!!
<|endoftext|> Or are you just playing it down to "just tripping"?Im playing it down to "The chemistry in your brain is so out of whack it produces altered states" DMT allows you to remove your consciousness from the confines of the body and temporarily experience existence beyond it, but from the perspective as the "you" that you are at the point in time when taking the chemical.Ive done DMT and it certainly has a long term meaningful effect on your body and brain. Hallucinating shuts down most of you brain and elevates activity in the default mode complex. 
<|endoftext|>"The Edge...There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.

But the edge is still Out there.- Hunter S. Thompson"Righteous quote, man!
<|endoftext|>Law enforcement officers.  I'm just perplexed that the afterlife is plagued with more peons "just following orders".
<|endoftext|>Yes! I have weird flashes of things that are far beyond my level of learning. Recently, I saw the structure of space and time,wish I had the math to adequately explain it.A gift it may be, but it's also hard freaking work!
<|endoftext|>Reminds me of Stranger Things. There is nothing, it's all black but there are still "things" *living* there - when Eleven goes to the Upside Down world/dimension.
<|endoftext|>I know right? However, having done some research into Thelema and Crowley before coming across the podcast it's pretty apt.
<|endoftext|>If it makes you feel any better, I totally whispered "just kidding little buddy! dont get eaten!" after I posted that.
<|endoftext|>Oh man, I just saw this. Thank you!I usually meditate at night, so I generally don't have too many problems.But there are times when I'd like to meditate during the day without resorting to earplugs, lol. I'll definitely give the video a watch. :)
<|endoftext|>Hey! I tried again and here's my reply:  was an odd and unusual experience, different from when I usually meditate but I'm not sure if what happened was actually relevant or just a random occurrence.
<|endoftext|>If it is a simulation, there is no way out. You are code and this completely trapped.Not much point to it.
<|endoftext|>It isn't so much a simulation. We live in the 3rd dimension, which is a low vibrational frequency. We aren't able to manifest reality very well in a low vibrational state. Thus it's easier to "trick" spirits into certain ways of thinking and believing here. And yes the Elites and aliens are working together to keep us here but they can't FORCE us to. They can only trick us into agreeing to stay. And a lot of us are fooled.The most important thing every person needs to understand is that NOTHING IN ALL OF EXISTENCE can harm you. And I promise you that this is 100% correct. You cannot ever be forced to do anything. You choose what happens to you and ONLY you. 
<|endoftext|>Without a doubt they work. I wasnt disputing that at all. But I have flown many planes and they all had the engines under the wing not pointing out the front. 
<|endoftext|>If the point has already been made by another user, your needless mockery adds nothing to the conversation. If you don't have anything nice or useful to say then just keep your mouth shut. 
<|endoftext|>Sorry for such late reply, but I get what you mean. When I was 8 years old I entered a ceramic draft horse in the Lake County Fair (IL). OK see I just typed out a paragraph about my experience with that but deleted it because it didn't contribute so yeah. Anyway. My entry won 1st Place and Best of Show so my aunt called me and said, "General, hang on to your hat!" And all I could do was reach onto my head where my Marriott's Great America visor rested, and said anxiously, "Which ONE??!!" I did not understand metaphor, turns of phrase or any linguistic tricks as I expected adults to be direct and that there would be dire consequences if I did not, indeed, hang on to the correct hat. Perhaps my green plastic visor was the hat referred to and it somehow was worth a lot of money because Shaun Cassidy touched it? Or because one of the Banana Splits wore it as they slid down the slide in the intro to their show? Who KNOWS?  I have been drinking sorry.
<|endoftext|>I went too deep into the Astral, for too long, on one of my visits and could feel the cord pulling me back into our reality.
<|endoftext|>Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. - Ecclesiastes 12:6-7 
<|endoftext|>Hi. It is very sad. They are all over the place in the afterlife and do whatever they are told: Which is keep the deceased in their place. They also go nuts when they see a living person speaking with a deceased one. 
<|endoftext|>Well, thats my choice personally, learning the math is as you said the tough part. But it aint impossible, so thats what i am doing. Got quite a few products already lined up and they basically just need some last minute math and i need to save up the money for patents, but my employer may got me covered on that front, so that means "only" the math. I keep everything very hush hush, because if i do tell people, they would declare me either crazy or a fraud, nothing is more real then reality and thats why I say go for it. Its super rewarding translating those abstract concepts in real life prototypes and devices.
<|endoftext|>Well that is because you wont beat them at their own game, the wining condition is to stop living in their reality and create another one.
<|endoftext|>Hi. I am glad to see someone else understands. This link below is for those who are unfamiliar with the horrific truth: We are enslaved to produce **Loosh Energy**
<|endoftext|>You might be thinking of the 737-1xx/2xx which had the underwing (pod) style JT8D low bypass turbofans, they were incredibly loud and inefficient and didn't stick out very far Infront of the wing. Which lead to them changing to the forward strutted CFM56 highbypass in the 737-300/500/700 model.The reason you haven't seen them is because there are virtually zero flying anymore. I know this is old as but yeeah, it ain't a conspiracy.
<|endoftext|>It is funny to me and the friends I read it to as I wrote it :DAnd the idea was fucking stupid, just because you never looked at an airplane doesnt mean they changed it. Mandela effects are stupid, people making a conspiracy out of their failure to notice things or know correct spelling. It makes actual theorists look stupid and is total disinfo. (If there *is* any conspiracy to it, it would be that ME is a constructed meme to disorient people with false info and make them not notice things that really happen; to make everything seem like misinfo. You are being *primed* buddy.)
<|endoftext|>Is sleep paralysis related to this? I've had it twice and each time I'm about 4-7 feet away from where I'm laying down and then I zip right back to my original spot, full of sweat. First time my teddy was floating above me, the second time my ceiling fan was moving to the right while I was getting pulled to the left. Both lasted about 5-10 seconds, I couldn't move or yell but I was trying. Bed soaked in sweat both times.
<|endoftext|>All I remember is that it was like a small black cloud.. it happened a very long time ago. I remember that I was more confused than scared. 
<|endoftext|>I used to hate math so much, I'd die rather than learn it. Now I have died, I'm voluntarily learning it. A true rebirth.I thought I was making my " knowing" up until I told my husband one of them, and it then happened. I tell him every time now, so I have a backup.Personally, I had to admit it's really happening, because it is. I don't care if someone thinks I'm insane, as that's what I was like, before.
<|endoftext|>I did! I replied above.Here's the link to my reply: 
<|endoftext|>Yeah if anyone figures out what they mean please tell me. I feel everything I learned in Biology was a lie.
<|endoftext|>Its not a conspiracy. Whats a conspiracy and the biggest one Ive encountered is the mandela effect cover up. You may know that engines point out in front but bet many people you know dont. Just ask them. This is one you can find out yourself. Just ask people where thy recall Statue of Liberty being. Liberty island or Ellis island. Many will think Ellis. Or what does the thinker statue look like. Or American gothic painting. Is it looney tunes or looney toons ? Fabreeze/ febreeze or febreze. What does the ford logo look like ? Has the Coca Cola logo looked like that since 1913 ? What colour is the A team van ? Do they recall John Goodman dying ? Did Mickey Mouse have braces ? Just look for yourself and ask. There are thousands. Some will know things as they are. But many will recall things as they were. And all in the same wrong way. 
<|endoftext|>If you're purely taking the piss just so you can read your own comment out to your friends for a laugh to make you look popular then why go for the one that's obviously a poor theory? Like, the theory itself being a poor one is plainly obvious to anyone reading. Your commentary adds nothing other than making others think: "Wow... Great... You can make fun of an idiot. What next?! Gonna go tell a flat earther that the earth is round? You must be so clever." Get over your ego. There's no need to needlessly open your mouth and add nothing when the issue speaks for itself just fine. 
<|endoftext|>Ive flown all over the world. The engines are pointing out the front of the wing. You on the other hand have hardly been on a plane. I can tell, so feel free to mock as its the easiest thing in the world to do with the ME as now its always been like that and you are of course right. But for me the engines used to be under the wing not pointing out front. 
<|endoftext|>Funny, the thing I saw was a small black cloud too, maybe the size of a soccer ball or a little bigger. 
<|endoftext|>I don't really care about any of that. I'm just pointing out the reason you don't see underslung pod style engines on B737s anymore.
<|endoftext|>That is almost fair... sometimes I browse reddit and something makes me laugh out loud and have to explain... the conspiracy of plane engines was such a thing.I will admit it was more asshole than constructive, *mea culpa*!
<|endoftext|>The engines on 747s, to my recollection (and I have never paid it much attention) have always been on a forward-angled strut beneath the wing, and that is confirmed by photos. Of course, if you know anything at all about aerospace engineering, the engine and wing design is *the primary area of optimization for flight* meaning the fuselage doesnt change much but the orientation of the engine struts do. Mostly this would not be readily discernible except from blueprints.Also, please! Tell me how many times I have been on an airplane, lol!Is that some measure of *sophistication* or *intelligence* or *coolness* to you!? Or do you presume to learn about aviation engineering by *osmosis*; the more time you spend on an airliner the more you suddenly know about them? How much time have you spent on a sailing yacht? Bullet train? Hot air ballon? Lmao, I am not sure how to even calculate whatever *pissing contest* you seem to implying with that. You are not from the first world maybe? Being on an airplane impresses your people? Maybe you are the first in your village to obtain passage on the *metal bird*!?The humorous part is that I have not spent a great deal of time on commercial airliners, yet I have a friend who is an enthusiast pilot and has a private plane and I have spent a good amount of time on pleasure flights and have taken the controls on multiple occasions. How does that one compare in your worldview?
<|endoftext|>That's what a girl told me, but my mind realizes half way through and pulls me back. Idk any of this stuff though
<|endoftext|>Sure there are reasons. But I most certainly recall many planes having engines under the wing and no pointing forward. Though strange you dont care history changes and you dont notice. But hey thats cool. 
<|endoftext|>The humerus part is that you have not spent a great deal of time on commercial airliners. Yeah I know thats why I said it. Wasnt trying to have a pissing contest. Its just an observation. As it happens I have and I recall very vividly never seeing the engines petruding like that. Engines work under the wing or petruded forward. Im not debating whether it works or not. Weve seen engines work in the tail and all sorts. Thrust and speed are the important factors. Its just for many the engines were under the wings that is all. Anyway heres stuff you havent heard of Ribbon sealsRainbow treesRainbow mountains Saiga antelopeOkapi Gremlin monkeys Purple tarantulas And the little piggy tail in the ford logo. Well if you have heard of any not before 2016. Now am I psychic ? Or is something else going on ? 
<|endoftext|>you may have a talent for out of body travel. you should do significant research on the subject. robert monroe wrote 3 incredible books that will be a great place to start.
<|endoftext|>I have been an avid aviation nut my whole life, it's pity you don't know the models of these aircraft because I'd be able to tell you exactly what you are seeing. You are just remembering wrong. This is well documented and researched phenomena of the brain.
<|endoftext|>Okapi, is that a Japanese mythical creature?What is your point with that list? I am not going to bother searching those, are rainbow trees the common name for some species or is that something else? There are a fuck ton of trees any person on earth has not heard of, are you familiar with *malcura pomifera*? Anyway, *Phinnaeus Fog*, I suppose you have spent more time on commercial airlines, what is your point?Btw: the humerus [*sic*] part is a bone in your arm but I know what you meant ;)Edit: looked up a few of those for kicks, dunno what the animals are supposed to prove, like I said there are a million kinds of animal whos common names I dont know off the top of my head, the *Rainbow Mountians* however, I have heard of and seen pics of for years (probably because I am in the US instead of the UK and photos of the Americas are obviously more common here) usually I have heard them called the more common Painted Mountains though.
<|endoftext|>downloaded the audio files that change your frequency (done on a study group at a university?), just never got to it yet as my last years have been tough with my fathers cancer. Idk if I should try while I'm not at my best. The past months have been good though and I'm back in shape. Someone else has said the same, any suggestions to begin with?
<|endoftext|>I for instance am an empath, I can feel anyone's energy in a room, half the time finish their sentences.. And just generally put myself in people's shoes very easily. You would definitely know if you were hypersensitive to energies 
<|endoftext|>Not if you see it happening. And no its not remembering wrong.  Ive seen things change first hand. Not remember. Raindrops keep falling on my head ? Nope. Thats another fine mess you got me into ? Nope. Did the little Austrian girl have braces when she rescued jaws in moon raker ? Nope. Did the witch say fly my pretties fly ? Nope. Did Oliver Twist say please sir, can I have some more ? Nope And where is kitt in knight rider ? Behind the steering wheel no one said. And what about rainbow trees. Where did those come from ? But Ill leave you recall things as you like. But you dont recall the Coca Cola logo always looking like that do you ? Or field of dreams if you build it they will come ? Anyway enough for now. 
<|endoftext|>We were talking about simulation theory. As for rainbow mountains they are in China. Im not trying to show off Im really not. Why would I know that you have t heard of most of those. Yet I name a couple of other obscure animals. Like the Mongolian fox. Im pretty sure when you google it youll recognise it. As for the mountains. Ive been in the Himalayas. Also. Atlas Mountains and up Kilimanjaro. I am no mountaineer but I love a trek and something different rather than sitting on a beach getting caned. But Id never heard of the rainbow mountains. Nor has anyone I know before 2016. And South America ? Bet it isnt where you think it is. 
<|endoftext|>There are also ones in Peru. When I googled it to verify, it comes back with those first. Dunno.Also I havent specifically heard of the Mongolian fox any more than a ribbon seal, I mean I am not an avid animal enthusiast to know a ton of different species, lol, but do have an interest in dendrology and tree/plant identification. My interest in that is particular to the USA so you could literally name *millions* of species of plants that I have never heard of. I have seen pictures of those rainbow trees but I couldnt give an exact timeframe, I believe it was from search engine junk when looking for something specific, one of those 10 amazing looking trees from around the world type things. Also listed was the *Amur Cherry* which is also rather wild looking.Btw: there are apparently many [rainbow mountains]( in [Canada]( to the wise, the more impressive photos are taken with filters to enhance the actual colors.Also, what do you mean about South America? Are you referring to the *very common* mistake people unfamiliar with geography make in thinking it starts with the southern border of the USA? (Common mistake of thinking Latin America means South America. Lest you think I cheated, I live in Texas and this is not something I have to look up, btw.)
<|endoftext|>Interesting those mountains being in Canada as well. Wasnt aware of that they crop up everywhere Fair point about nature. I was a bit of a closet nature geek to be honest. Im referring to the common mistake most people have of South America being south of USA. Not south east. [which one looks right to you ?]( Ok some specific USA questions. Does Mount Rushmore look like you recall. Ie George Washington had that shirt ? Do you recall Statue of Liberty being on Ellis island ?Have you heard about the black Tom explosion ?Have you heard of the field of giant presidents heads ? Not sure how old you are but did you watch the A team and do you know the colour of the van ? And do you remember Mickey Mouse having braces ? Used to run his thumbs down his braces saying hello Pluto Was it fruit loops or froot loops for you ?Do you remember John goodman dieing ? How long ago did robin Williams die ? They arent trick questions I would have got all of these wrong. The one that got me was six people in the car with JFK for me there was only four and I can tell you all about the driver William Greer. I have no clue about Roy kellerman and what hes doing in the car. 
<|endoftext|>What... So because I don't align with your views I'm not part of this sub? I get into some conspiracies, most of them are fuckn nonsense though.
<|endoftext|>The South America thing I think is the effect of different map projections, most people are used to the Mercator one (whew, dont ask how I remember that, lol, it is like 1066 William of Normandy, one of those things I remembered without ever trying). Okay:Mount Rushmore, Washington always had a faint lapel outline but I am not sure if that is what you mean, I think he has a cravat also.Lady Liberty was always on Liberty island, immigrants went to Ellis island, *this is literally why immigrants in paintings and even An American Tail the cartoon are looking across the bay to the Statue of Liberty*! If the statue were on Ellis Island, they would be looking up her skirt!No clue about Black Tom. Never heard of it.The A-team van was dark grey or black with an orange stripe. Not old enough to watch it but a guy in my town has a replica of if. (Or did he get it wrong!?)Dont recall Mickey Mouse having braces ever. Was this like a single cartoon short? (Like the old ones where each cartoon was its own story and Mickey did all sort of different stuff? I can easily imagine they may have made an episode where he has braces.)Was always Froot Loops common American marketing crap where it is misspelled. The Os on both Froot and Loop used pictures of the cereal. I would imagine that any confusion is just that people have a built in spellcheck that flils in crorect splelings aotumatically, like how you can read that with no problem!Field of President heads!? Are you combining Mt. Rushmore with Easter Island!? Never heard that one before. (Sorry, out of order.)I met John Goodman randomly in New Orleans a few years ago at a restaurant! I *have* heard of this Mandela Effect thing online before but that is the only place I know of hearing it.Seems like Robin Williams only died a year or two ago, but the way time flies I am guessing it was probably more like 5 or more. Movies that came out in 2005 still seem recent to me, part of getting older?Thats is off the top of my head, you gotta tell me if I got the right or not (or if I have false memories!)
<|endoftext|>Agree with that. Though this one, unfortunately isnt, in fact when you see it its not even a conspiracy. I see many recoil from this until they see it. Oh and Mount Rushmore changed for many people. And no ones heard of the Great Wall of India. Or ribbon seals. Or bird eating trees. Strange how I know that ? 
<|endoftext|>Robin Williams died in 2014. Four years ago. And yes all the others you are have got right. Though for me statue of Liberty was on Ellis island. I dont know Mount Rushmore well enough. As for the a team van. It was always all black with a red stripe. I saw the same clip change from a black van to the one with a grey top. As for South America. Ok the map thing. Just try and find any map at all that has it under the USA where many recall it ? There are literally hundreds. Though if youre under 26 we seem to find youll likely know what it is now than what many of us recall. We may be from different dimensions. Who knows. Its very strange though. As for Easter island. Some of the statues now have hats. And the islander were not wiped out. I clearly recall the island being deserted when re discovered. 
<|endoftext|>I am over 30. I usually have a very sharp memory (like for random details more than for stuff I need to remember, so maybe it is all about perception?)I realized the South America thing, it looks like it is under the USA *on a globe*! (Well angle is crucial, but the roundness makes the illusion, not the map projection so much.I remember the hats on Easter Island from some paranormal shows in the 90s, the guy was trying to figure out the pattern or if the hats meant they were kings or something like that. I *also* remember hearing that everyone left the island because they cut down all the trees to move the heads and the island became inhospitable! (I *will* admit that reeks of some Aesops fable type thing about the folly of environmental damage so I wouldnt be too shocked to learn it was an exaggeration.)Oh, the Presidents head things is neat, never heard of it. Reminds me of Russia (or that level on Goldeneye 007).Another thought about the Froot Loops thing: it is particularly evident to me how this one started, *most people dont carry on marketing misspellings when writing*. I bet no mother writes Froot Loops on a grocery list, rather, fruit loops. This is likely why so many dont realize the logo. Just like a redneck I am writing about may drink a bud light but likely not a Bud Lite.Oh, I thought of one, probably US specific... it is actually a pet-peeve of mine when people misspeak the names of things (commonly adding a possessive s to road names or store names Walmarts as a pernicious example) and I can honestly envision *someone, somewhere* eventually trying to call this a Mandela Effect: Sports Academy when referring to Academy (sports and outdoors) which is an American outdoor retailer. It annoys the shit out of me, there is a store called Sports Authority and there is Academy but I have heard so many people say it this way. As I said, just an odd pet-peeve, but *if* you ever come across it, remember you heard it here first!
<|endoftext|>The Home Depot ? Or Home Depot. Staples logo. Ford logo. Volvo logo. ?Sounds to me like you have some explanations right off the bat. I saw fruit loops change to froot loops. I saw Hilary Clinton change to Hillary Clinton. Australia didnt used to be next to Papua New Guinea. As for Easter island I remember clearly a documentary as to where they could all have gone to. It was a mystery. Now theyve always been there. If you dont see it then I guess you dont see it. For some of us we have no choice it hits us hard and kinda shakes your world a little lol 
<|endoftext|>Remember when Walmarts logo was a smiley face instead of an asterisk? I dunno what the point of company logos changing is.
<|endoftext|>No nor me. Coca Cola gets me as well. I grew up with the logo having no dash or dot what ever it is. Its far reaching and even the human anatomy. Our heart has moved the liver got bigger. And we have bones behind our eye sockets. All very weird. 
<|endoftext|>Dunno that advertising is a valid thing... brands change their marketing constantly. For example it was always *The* Home Depot on the logo but their commercials used to simply say Home Depot. Not a conspiracy, just different slogans. Literally dont know what you are getting at with the anatomy! The heart? It is always off-center to the left and slightly below the sternum. Liver size? Was the person a heavy drinker? /s.I think this is an odd effect of people refusing to admit they are wrong about things and calling it a conspiracy instead. Seems arrogant as fuck.Edit: btw, still harping on the South America thing... *I know* that it always looked like it really is, not even optical illusion because it matches the shape of Arifca, where it broke apart. I remember cutting out the shapes in elementary school when we learned about Pangea and the teacher showing us how the continents fit together, just glanced at it again and remembered that. If it were not further east, that wouldnt work since Africa is shaped like an upside down L sort of.
<|endoftext|>Arrogance ? If you were in any way open to this youd ask for some proof. Some sort of evidence instead of calling me arrogant. As for brands. Dont you think thats what we all thought at first. When I saw the dash in kit Kat had gone I assumed a re brand. Or the arrow in the Volvo logo. Or the vw sign being separate instead of one vw crossed in the middle. Or the ford logo with the pigs tail in it. ? Surely its arrogant to assume someone is lying to you and suggesting history algae changed without asking for proof. Im not interested in convincing anyone. But you seem interested in convincing me Im wrong. I just found out about zealandia today. Never heard of it or those two ridges that seem to come out the top of it. Sri Lanka has also lived for me. And I live in the Uk and am Scottish. Before it was impossible to see Ireland from Scotland. Now you can. You didnt mention whether or not you were surprised at robin Williams death in 2014. How about Aretha Franklin is still alive ? Diana ross died for me about 12 years ago yet shes still here. All very strange stuff. Re the Home Depot. I have family in the states. So whilst I may not know brands that well here for some reason American brands stick in the mind better maybe its because I just am more aware of my surroundings when in the states. But I dont recall the Home Depot. Bit like I recall Jc penny and not jc Penney. 
<|endoftext|>I am not directly calling you arrogant, I am saying there is some arrogance in the entire idea I am not *wrong*, they *changed the whole world*!Surely you can see the arrogance in that thought?I had to look up the Volvo thing, I thought you meant they *removed* the arrow, then I would have believed you since the Volvo logo has always been the male emblem! That was the first car my parents had since I was alive and I remember it well, a 1980 240D with a standard transmission. Are you saying you *didnt* know it had an arrow!?Now the VW one, I know for a fact it has appeared with and without the little line dividing the V and W... as depicted [here]( so we agree on that one!Not surprised about Robin Williams, like I said when you asked, I thought it seemed like a year or two but I supposed it could easily be more like 5, so 4 years ago is pretty much exactly in the timeframe I mentioned.I knew Aretha Franklin isnt dead, why do you think she is? Are you confusing her with Whitney Houston? She died a while back (edit: Wikipedia says 2012, had to fact-check myself).Re: countries or islands, there are tons we havent heard of because they are not relevant to world news, I had never heard of the Azores until about 5 years ago while reading a travelogue book, that never made me think it was invented just because it never crossed my conscious awareness previously. Look at a detailed world map, I am sure we could each list 100 islands or countries the other has never heard of.Also, JC Penny, if you had asked me the spelling before gaining me the correct one I couldnt have said for certain despite there being one I pass on my daily commute,we just dont pay much attention to these things (for the record, I probably would have spelt it correctly, not because I know but because I would have spelt penny the same as the coin.)
<|endoftext|>My dad had a Volvo. Reg VJB 138 Y. I dont remember the arrow. It was never there for me. And youre sounding like a shill. We dont pay much attention ? How do you know what I do and dont pay attention to. And re the anatomy changes. Why do t you go over to retconned and see what a trained nurse has to say about them. The kidneys are too high up in our body. And no Im not confusing Whitney houston for Aretha Franklin. Sorry pal your playing the same tune Ive heard a thousand times. Are you confusing etc etc etc. You dont pay much attention to etc etc etc. 
<|endoftext|>Say I am a shill, it is an insulting way to say we disagree.I was taking the time to actually think about and give input on what you brought up. Seems like you want to prove your theory by simply ignoring and insulting anyone whos experience differs from yours. Dont know how you missed that arrow, I remember asking my mom if the Volvo was only for dads when I learned the male and female symbols and noticed it on the car. The anatomy, I have a vague and general idea of where organs are, not enough to actually be surprised if my knowledge isnt very accurate, I am going by memories of those take apart organ models in high school. I am not a physician or nurse so I have never studied anatomy in depth.I do know how to kidney punch someone, are they not on the back just under the bottom ribs? That is where I know of them. Out of curiosity what does a kidney belt look like and how is it worn?But whatever, tune out any conflicting info and brainwash yourself.
<|endoftext|>Personally, I've noticed my attention span drastically decrease when I downloaded social media onto my smartphone. Deleted it two weeks ago and I'm still struggling with the constant need to look at a screen every 5 minutes. Flip phones are few and far between but they are available and I'm thinking of getting one. Let's not forget that when kids are raised with these they are significantly under-socialized and it encourages an instant gratification mindset. Colorado is the first one to implement a [minimum age for smartphones]( 
<|endoftext|>In addition to all of these great points, I would like to point out the increasing level of troll like behaviors in real life interactions. Behind a keyboard, it is easy to lash out with a snarky reply, hop right into a ridiculous argument, or just flat out be mean to another human being. This is translating into real life behaviors. No longer are the days of respectful dialogues, common courtesies and basic human interactions. People have lost basic human connections and its showing more and more each day. Gone are the days of being respectful to your neighbors, now you are met with a fuck you attitudes. Gone are the days of striking up a casual conversation while waiting in line. Gone are the days of playing a board game with the family. The more people disconnect from each other because they are always connected the further into the abyss we go. 
<|endoftext|>Well at the beginning I loved it, I loved the thought of a smarter phone. Something being more useful to me. Then, I realized that everything I'm doing is being documented somehow and that this is the realization of the book 1984. Every phone has a camera. Then when Snowden shared his stories on how guys in the NSA exchange pictures taken illegally from webcams on women, wow I really understood. This is no BS. They intend to control EVERYTHING. And record every fucking fart you make.So I quit Facebook, although I have to use Google for work and such. But all through VPN, it is seriously a grim future. It makes me sad, and to some extent a bit depressed. We have allowed a few to control the many, and even though we outnumber them - they probably have a plan for a social revolution. This isn't going to end well in my opinion, sadly. Smart "tech" and AI are enslavement tools, we love the easiness of it, but we sacrifice everything else. The generations growing up now are documenting willingly each moment of their lives.
<|endoftext|>One of the main dangers of these "smart devices" is that we have become so accustomed to having them do our "thinking" and "remembering" for us that, deprived of access to their "magic" without them, we become helpless.They have changed the way with think, the way our memories work, and the way we process information. This goes beyond the individual level, affecting how society functions as a whole - government, industry, academia, etc... all are bound up in the web.Like"magic glasses" the tech allow us to "see" and "learn" things we could never have seen before -- but at a cost: Lose the glasses, and we're rendered blind and helpless.The network of technology is extremely fragile, and vulnerable to failures that can come from multiple sources, man-made (accidental or intentional) or natural (such as a knock-out solar flare).We've painted ourselves into one hell of a corner, I think.
<|endoftext|>As someone who has avoided 'smart' technology like the plague (despite working in a highly technologically advanced industry), I'm very interested in this discussion. Since my first mobile, I've purchased inexpensive phones that can call, text and sometimes take a shitty photo but unfortunately my trusty 10 year old LG has finally died, and I'm now in a position where an entry level smartphone may be my only option. 
<|endoftext|>It can be used as a (permanent) crutch and tool of degeneracy, or it can supply the wisdom of the ages. Try to suck all the knowledge you can out of it and move on.
<|endoftext|>I think one of the biggest effects of smart phones on society is going to be manifested on the children of this first generation of smart technology. As a parent myself, I've caught myself on numerous occasions when one of my kids comes to me for something, telling my kids "Hold On a second while Daddy finishes writing this email".  I find myself getting extremely annoyed irritated vat my own kids when they "interrupt" me while I'm immersed in my phone.I've also seen this happen with my wife, and saw the absolute look of dejection on their faces. By not giving them e are essentially inferring to them that our phones are more important to us then they are.This not only has negative effects physcologically on them, it's also driving them into the same addictive loop that we are in. If the phone is more important to Mommy and Daddy then I am, I must have one myself.By emotionally neglecting our kids, and not giving them are undivided attention, they will surely try and find that attention in other things, including drugs, alcohol, and other destructive behaviors in search of devotion.Even after I became aware of how my addiction to smart phones was negatively impacting them, I still would still catch myself ignoring them, or even worse isolating myself in a separate room, so I could use my smart phone unmolested.In order to be completely and totally present around our kids now, my wife and I purchased a landline, and now forward all incoming calls from our cell phones to the home phone, and we leave our phones in the car. Well we at least leave them in the car until the kids are asleep, at which point we usually go and get them to catch up on all the things we missed for several hours, completely ignoring each other.I believe the effects on our children are going to very detrimental in the long term.
<|endoftext|>The device is just a piece of hardware. It's the software that addicts. Take out the phone battery or break it, and you're not addicted.Many of the answers focus on games, not social media. Why?For purposes of discussion, is a laptop a smart device? What about a smart TV?Assuming a tablet definitely is a smart device.What is a good phone to get that is dumb?
<|endoftext|>I have a theory that technology was given to us by aliens in order to eventually enslave us kind of like The Matrix. The idea is to separate us from everything that we're suppose to be connected to. Nature, spirituality, each other and the cosmos. This is done with all sort of division tactics, the creation of violent religions, war, creating conflict, lying and manipulating us to believe in false concepts of love and God. Then we become so unhappy, we get addicted to all sorts of things. Technology being the easiest and safest thing, we think. It makes our lives better and more convenient. And look how easy it is to communicate with all my friends. Except it's not real communication. It's words on a screen. We need human interaction. We need be to out in nature. We need to be able to look up at the sky at night and see the incredible amount of stars in the milky way to be reminded of what we are instead of barely seeing anything because of light pollution. And through those 3 things, we will be able to connect to the spirituality of life itself. The divine spark inside of all life. It is any wonder our country has all the problems it does with drugs, suicide and anti-depressants? Our bodies are trying to tell us something. This isn't the way humans are suppose to live. Our natural reward systems have been hijacked and rewired.This all started with the Neolithic Revolution. 7 (I think?) different spots all around the world over the course of thousands of years, all moved from hunter/gatherers to agricultural societies, independent of one another and then spread all over the globe. These groups say they got this knowledge and technology from beings from the sky, usually referred to as dragons. A model for this can even be seen in the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible. Adam and Eve get kicked out of the Garden of Eden (nature) and cursed to work the ground while Eve is told to be subservient to Adam which creates the patriarchy. That was the first step to separate us from nature and put us at odds with it, not caring if we destroy it. This also took us from abundance thinking being hunter/gatherers where everything was out in nature, you just had to go get it and you only take what you need since there was always more. To famine thinking with agriculture because you only had so many animals and crops each harvest. That induces a sort of paranoia and guardianship over what is yours because you need it to survive. In nature, everything belongs to everyone and there will always be more somewhere. This shift in thinking and lifestyle lead us all onto the path to where we are now. When farming is how you depend on your survival, you're going to try and create things that make that survival more likely and make it easier. There was no need for new technology in hunter/gatherers aside from, you could argue, weapons to hunt with and to possibly fight off another tribe but they got along just fine with what they had and there was no major competition to drive more creation of technology.[ the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects, mostly diseases and warfare.  The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increment in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth. Average height went down from 5'10" (178 cm) for men and 5'6" (168 cm) for women to 5'5" (165 cm) and 5'1" (155 cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.  The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. Jared Diamond (in The World Until Yesterday) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged inequality between the sexes.So with agriculture, you bring about the need for large scale governments, leaders, social elites, slaves. The people now fight over resources, especially because of population increases. With those increases, comes the need for more control. Today, there's only a handful of companies who control the vast majority of our food that comes from agriculture. Looking at this Wikipedia entry, you can see the various problems and devastating effects that large scale agriculture is having on our planet. It's helping drive climate change and climate change will undoubtedly cause famines due to droughts and other extreme weather patterns around the world. There's no way this will be sustainable unless some sort of major shift happens in at least the way we get our energy.[ **environmental impact of agriculture** is the effect that different farming practices have on the ecosystems around them, and how those effects can be traced back to those practices. The environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world. Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.  There are two types of indicators of environmental impact: "means-based", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and "effect-based", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater, that is effected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil. An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based. The means-based evaluation looks at farmers' practices of agriculture, and the effect-based evaluation considers the actual effects of the agricultural system. For example, means-based analysis might look at pesticides and fertilization methods that farmers are using, and effect-based analysis would consider how much CO2 is being emitted or what the Nitrogen content of the soil is.  The environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil variety, people, plants, and the food itself. Some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are climate change, deforestation, genetic engineering, irrigation problems, pollutants, soil degradation, and waste.Interesting to think that this one shift in our way of living has lead us down a very specific road and the knowledge from which this shift is accredited to, has basically the same story across the world, that it's from other worldly beings. Only through this shift has the control and enslavement of the entire human race been possible. The driving need to constantly improve technology, dig up oil, deforest the planet, emit greenhouse gases, use up a large portion of our water supply, etc

By 2026, it estimates another 800,000 will be needed to support 5G.The network update will bring more Americans into closer proximity with milimeter waves, very short-wave radiation.Research on cell phone radiation has yielded mixed findings, but some studies have linked older wireless service generations to cancers of the heart and reproductive organs, and 5G's health effects have hardly been studied.Wireless providers have begun installing 800,000 'small cell' towers to support the roll out of the new 5G cellular network, but some public health experts warn they may endanger humans.The new network is slated to support 100 billion devices, connecting to the internet at anywhere between 10 and 100 times the speeds that information travels through the 4G network.In order to facilitate these speeds, the new network communicates through millimeter waves (MMWs) rather than microwaves, as previous generations have.The microwave networks are nearly saturated, hence the switch to the virtually untouched, lower frequency MMWs for 5G.But smaller waves cannot travel as far, or through as many types of materials.This means that there will need to be far more individual 'small cell towers' closer together - some have suggested they will be on every street corner in the US.The 5G technology is too new to have been thoroughly tested and studied by many parties outside of cell service providers.According to Dr Joel Moskowitz, a public health professor at the University of California, Berkeley, MMWs could pose a very real danger.'The deployment of 5G, or fifth generation cellular technology, constitutes a massive experiment on the health of all species,' he told Daily Mail Online.Because MMWs are weaker than microwaves, they are predominantly absorbed by the skin, meaning their distribution is quite focused there,'Since skin contains capillaries and nerve endings, MMW bio-effects may be transmitted through molecular mechanisms by the skin or through the nervous system,' Dr Moskowitz writes on his blog.He also told Daily Mail Online that he's concerned that '5G will use high-band frequencies, or millimeter waves, that may affect the eyes, the testes, the skin, the peripheral nervous system, and sweat glands.''Millimeter waves can also make some pathogens resistant to antibiotics,' he added.Dr Moskowitz is not alone in apprehensions.The International Society of Doctors for the Environment, its subsidiaries in 27 countries, and more than 200 doctors and scientists are all calling for a stop to be put to the roll out of 5G, 'due to concern that 5G radio frequency radiation will have adverse health effects,' Dr Moskowitz says.So far, their warnings have gone unheeded.Verizon began rolling out their 5G small cell towers in 11 cities 2017, and AT&T started installing the new generation of service in Waco and Dallas, Texas, as well as in Atlanta, Georgia this year.[ information:Scientists and Doctors Demand Moratorium on 5G5G Wireless Technology: Is 5G Harmful to Our Health? 5G Wireless Technology: Millimeter Wave Health Effects5G Wireless Technology: Cutting Through the Hype5G Wireless Technology: Major newspaper editorials oppose "small cell" antenna billsCell Tower Health Effects\--Joel M.

<|endoftext|>In my own limited experience: Wi-Fi in very close proximity is very disruptive to cognitive functions. I did an unvoluntary test with a 1 watt wireless antenna once, to connect to another router in the house. The antenna was about 1 m from my desk and I was exposed to the wifi waves for a couple of hours a day. After a while I couldn't concentrate or even think straight. The most obvious symptoms were brain fog, headaches, dizzyness and sleepiness. There also appeared a high pitch ringing in my ears.Needless to say that I turn off Wi-Fi always on the router and phone and only use cable to connect them and recommend everyone to do the same.
<|endoftext|>Literally destroying social society at the very least. I am pretty bad with the constant messing with/checking/looking and all that comes with it. Every pause in conversation every awkward moment I see myself doing it. I catch myself and put it back and do it again less than 5 minutes later. So many triggers cause me to do it.I am conscious of it and actively trying to do something about it. I am 35 and for a big part of my life this wasn't a thing, neither was social media. I am very aware of all the problem. I am very aware of technology as a whole and what it is doing to society, and I STILL do it.I cant imagine what its like for 20 somethings. They dont know life without it. They most likely will not be convinced there is a problem. Even worse we got babies with tablets in front of their faces hypnotized by the digital wonder. Dopamine addicts being produced all over. How do they even stand a chance?Its bad. I dont know what can be done.

Just serving the desires of the public and filling their cravings for validation and interaction because now the have the technology to do it.

<|endoftext|>I realized I wasted my 20s online, reading bullshit. So, I've been trying to quit social media all summer. I keep deleting and re-downloading apps. I hate myself for it.I noticed I feel sort of anxious and ill when I'm within two feet of my phone. I feel better immediately after moving away from the phone.Today I went out without my smart phone. I went across town. It was fun. I felt present in a way I haven't been for years. I was THERE, in reality.
<|endoftext|>I have a flip phone. I feel out of place during social functions. Especially when the smart phone 'lul" takes place. I feel like just getting up and walking out. What the fuck is the point of spending time with people when they would rather play some lame game, read a bullshit article, or dick around on social media instead of interacting with the people they are presently with? I've never hated society more now than I ever have in my life. It sucks. Speaking up about it only makes me sound like a pretentious douche bag too. 
<|endoftext|>I don't believe that ban actually went into effect in CO.. that article you posted is discussing a proposed ban, and a quick search only brings up similar articles (about the proposal). Seems kind of a weird idea to me.. they're talking about fines for companies who sell phones that parents intend to give to children under 13 (wtf).. how about parents just do their damn jobs?

<|endoftext|>The more people disconnect from each other because they are always connected the further into the abyss we go.Very well said and so true. As someone who enjoys simple connections with complete strangers on the streets with a quick; Good morning, or genuinely compliment a total stranger for no reason, it deeply saddens me to see humanity disconnecting with one another. If everyone in the world would make it a point to genuinely compliment 2 strangers every day, we could change the world.

<|endoftext|>Glad to know I'm not the only one noticing this change. I have noticed the number of really good students getting smaller and smaller every semester to the point that I'm lucky if the top 1 or 2 students in a class of ~40 are at least pretty good. Five to six years ago, I could always rely on the top 4-8 students being excellent. The average student is now riding the line between passing and failing all the time if graded on an honest scale. Most instructors/professors end up just lowering their standards to keep their grade distribution from sucking, and this just makes the problem progressively worse and worse. I see a lot more students just completely give up and not even try to explain why. Something is wrong. I'm not convinced it's all just gaming, although I definitely see how that is one of the negative effects. I think people have relied on this technology so much at fundamental stages in their mental development that many never learned how to think and come up with ideas for themselves. Even worse, they stopped learning information entirely since they can just look up whatever they need at any given moment. Never mind the fact that your brain can work more efficiently when the information it needs is already firmly rooted in memory. People are starving and destroying the power of their unconscious mind by not feeding it enough information to process and organize and discover connections. This is the foundation of common sense. Fewer and fewer people have the common sense to use technology constructively because they don't even know where to begin reading up on anything outside of their limited scope of stunted understanding, nor would they even want to try if they could. Their attention span for critical thinking is approaching zero. Social media, gaming, sports, entertainment, and news are always at your fingertips. Why actually think about anything? They just look up a YouTube video later explaining how to answer the homework questions. They might retain only 10% of the needed skills the next day. If they can't find an online tutorial, they don't know how to read their textbooks so they just skip it. 
<|endoftext|>I have genuine conflicts with my device. First, I'll say that I would be so terribly ignorant without the years of gleaned information through the portal of a smartphone. Before I even hit online, a read stories and imagined in awe what it would be like to 'surf the net'. I found myself looking for breaking science, choosing Microbes as the overall favorite, following the catalog of the soil food web pioneered by Elaine Ingham.I found use with the built in blogging tool on MySpace, a feature brandished along the top right of your profile. It was here I began writing..well, these sort of news articles. I mocked the formats and prose I was used to reading, but pulled a bunch of content together that interrelated.I took a sniff at Facebook, maybe 2010 I guess - and hated it. It seemed like that platform was trying to minimize the input parameters of what I'm trying to say. Doesn't matter what, by then I was used to some elbow room, as Twitter failed the smell test with 140 characters. I mean, I'm running full speed on blogs by now, and platforms like Twitter and Facebook we're cramping my style.But, of course I had a Facebook account and some of my friends had crossed over, so I ghost-friended them and stuck ardently to MS. Then MS bugged out, and I'm woke enough to draw parallels with 9/11, stinks to hell.Where do I go? You got it, FB for 3 or 4 years, bitching about it to high heaven at least once a week, fuming at the limitations, the 30 day soft-ban, and in the end, straight up manipulation of my friends news feeds by not showing any posts from me. That made me rage.Now, FB is US military, it's messenger app listens, and still the only way for me to contact some of my favorite friends is through FB.Meanwhile, I study science and academic papers, sourced discoveries and the like, and think of ways to work them into my [novel WIP]( all the while learning. I say this, because I wish more people were inclined to read a little bit about some stuff and get something for it. If I could tell your students the power of utilizing the power of information at your fingertips...Maybe I'm just a geek or eccentric, but I am beginning a project that I'm calling my 'thesis', which is Restoration of a Derelict Property Through Microbial Arrest. It's a self-appointed achievement that capstones my eight years of self-study. The internet is so valuable as a mobile tool, it's unfathomable to limit it.The flip side is health. My life is in an upheaval, and right now I only have the phone. It's hard enough to keep a full charge on it, much less the laptop I charge up once a week.Constant use. And I mean constant. I am also a guitarist and singer, and I'm always looking up new songs - when I'm not watching Rick and Morty to death.But my left hand can't hold cell phone anymore. It hurts, pretty bad. I know why, yet I can't stop. I'm addicted to my handset, and it's killing me for it.Edit: I've strived to bridge the gap to interest higher learning. Maybe instuct your class to read this [blog]( and pick it apart for homework?
<|endoftext|>I think there's a connection between the metals they're spraying on us, and being magnetized to our phones. The advent of the smart grid has made receivers out of many tech products, and human bodies. 
<|endoftext|> But if i had a kid, i would NEVER let them have one. agree absolutely. though i feel a bit like one of my great, great grandparents in the '20's saying, "I'd NEVER let one of MY kids have their own car."
<|endoftext|>It's a very complicated problem to solve. The whole economy more and more relies on the Internet. The Internet is here to stay. So are the devices that enable convenient services 24/7. Can we blame a gaming company for finding tricks to have you play more often their games ? Their business model translates to : you play more = we make more money. Can we blame social media, or any website for implementing tricks for the same reason ? Probably not.I think the answer comes from regulations, education, and self-control/discipline. Regulations from authorities, such as ban smartphones in public schools for anyone below the age of 15. If we can successfully ban smoking and drugs at school for most, we surely can ban smartphones. That may take another 15 years before these guys wake up though. Education by authorities, parents at home, teachers. Teach kids how to use their smartphones the right way, parents who limit their use at home. Have authorities educate parents on the potential dangers of smartphones for the kids. IDK how effective that would be. It's still a step forward.Self control. If I couldn't apply any self control, I would be spending my whole day playing movies on the TV, playing video games, eating chips and drinking cola. I would also drink alcohol and experiment new drugs all the time. I did all this (except for the drugs) for some time in the past, not very long, and I stopped with enough self control, and self discipline. It's also self discipline that allows me to fast for a month each year, cook at home with fresh ingredients VS buy pre-made meals at the supermarket or eat a big mac. IDK if self discipline/self control are things that can be taught. Something to look into maybe.Sadly, given the addiction power of the smartphones, and its widespread, i'm afraid they are going to do lots of damage on people before anything is done.I know of parents who sit their (not even 1 yo) child in front of the TV at night, or hand over a smartphone to look at, while they are busy doing something else. They may not be aware of the damage, however, they have the same Internet that I have, so they have no excuse not to know.
<|endoftext|>Whenever I see kids or adults hooked on these types of addiction based grinding games which hardly requires any skill, memory or learning, I'm often reminded of that Star Trek TNG episode "The Game". Don't say you weren't warned!
<|endoftext|>Well said on all your points. I don't see it ending well either. It indeed causes sadness and, for me, fear and intense concern for our not-so-distant future. 
<|endoftext|>That's kind of just how techonlogy works though. The industrial revolution was amazing for the world and we built our lives around it. If we somehow lost the ability to mass produce, we would have been SOL with how we structured society around it's benefits. Technology always has that effect. But no, networks are a lot more stable than you think. Network anlysis suggests it'd be almost imppssinle for something like the internef to realistically go down, baring nuclear fallout. 
<|endoftext|>It's unfortunately become quite difficult to avoid the smartphone. I try to use mine as a tool rather than a crutch, but still find I instinctively pull it out of my pocket to mindlessly check it more often than I'd care to admit. Even worse, many jobs require you to have a smartphone for near ubiquitous access via email. 
<|endoftext|>its not like having a smart phone is akin to shooting up heroin. If you use your phone as a tool youll be fine. i have a note 8, and i use it for art and communication. i dont even have a single game installed on it and never had the temptation to download one. i think you'll be fine too

<|endoftext|>I had that realization about this time last year... and simultaneously realized that I hadn't read a proper book in several years, despite always being a bookworm when I was a kid (I was not very popular).Now it's been a year and I've consumed probably 30+ books in that time, some fiction, some non fiction and it's really changed my world.I realized that I had spent most of the previous decade in a fog, not really thinking that hard about anything. Now that I've broken it, I see it everywhere around me... especially in places like this where we are supposed to be digging for the truth, all too often we just let it get served to us... no thinking required, you just have to know the narrative.
<|endoftext|>Thats whats sad though is theyre literally killing the Internet with advertising. Ever notice how a lot of YouTube stuff you used to like doesnt show up anymore?

<|endoftext|>THIS. I've struggled to be entertained by my smartphone. I go to politics reddit, sometimes a couple other reddits, but primarily this one for entertainment.

<|endoftext|>Dude theres already many signals in the air, your wifi does not make such difference, maybe if you had 50 routers.
<|endoftext|>26, people my age are right on the verge. We grew up mostly without cell phones, playing outside, interacting with eachother, but that all changed right as we were leaving high school. We've been smack in the middle of both sides of this and if a revolution ever happens, we will be the ones leading the charge.. For all the shit we get I think we'll be the ones to finally do something. 
<|endoftext|>People think it's pretentious - and I don't mind people having issues with being around groups of people but when someone whips out their phone and just starts typing away while I'm talking and nodding - I guess I just have to live with the fact that I'm pretentious and think it's disrespectful af lol. 
<|endoftext|>As much as I want to agree with you too many people think that they're the exception or just plain ignore the data to settle with a standard PSA outreach program. These kids not only have access to them 24/7 but are encouraged to use them by schools as an education tool (in place of real conversation) and by parents as a babysitter/placating device. Instead of it being used as a tool, it has replaced all aspects of our lives. And now we have a swath of maladjusted, smartphone-dependent zombies walking around who can't comprehend self-sufficiency. Imo, if something is such an objective harm to society, it should be regulated.
<|endoftext|>Yes, thats exactly what Im talking about. When you stop interacting, you start believing all the bad things you see and hear on social media and the news. You start thinking that people really are bad/scary/hateful because thats what youre fed. But when you actually **talk** to people, you realize you have more in common than you dont. There are far more good ones than bad. That human connection is what keeps us all grounded in reality. Otherwise, as we see today, everyone becomes the enemy. Its isolating us, whether thats by design or just a byproduct. 
<|endoftext|>As someone who enjoys simple connections with complete strangers on the streets with a quick; Good morning, or genuinely compliment a total stranger for no reasonYou are not alone. We need to make a social media app that would help people like you and I connect.
<|endoftext|>I enjoy those simple connections with strangers. You made mention of genuine compliments...I feel the same ways that you do. The rampant disconnection taking place is troubling and saddening. I can't have one conversation with one of my very best friends now because he will absolutely be preoccupied with his smart phone, and he has a friend who really needs him now like never before. It really hit me when I was talking about my late mother with whom I was very close; One of his responses after looking up from his phone proved that he didn't realize that I'd been talking about my mother (what was said absolutely didn't apply to my mother at all...that was the dead giveaway). Man, it hurts when you get second billing to a smart phone, especially with an old (and supposedly close) friend. 
<|endoftext|>Luckily my 'hands on' work is done with no networking allowed. I look after my admin stuff at home on a laptop. I may have to look into getting the old landline hooked up again.
<|endoftext|>It is true. Also, despite serious health risks, lead paint was eliminated in 90's. I think it's because they know it blocks emf's.
<|endoftext|>As a recovered heroin addict.. It was alot easier to put down the heroin than my Note 8 I'm typing on right now. Both are mind control tools. 
<|endoftext|>Yes. We are doing our own will instead of God's. We think we each are our own God and we can do as we wish and nothing bad will happen. We think we can manipulate human genetics and create the "perfect" human, Designer babies are supposedly the future. Then we want to explore the cosmos and possibly seed other planets and create and manipulate other lifeforms. We think we're responsible enough to cause direct changes in the DNA of our race and change other planets when we can't even take care of ourselves?In my opinion, we are ALL God together, as one. I hurt you, I hurt myself. We are just pieces of the whole, experiencing other pieces of the whole but it is all just an illusion, we are the same. We are connected to each other through love and love comes from God.
<|endoftext|>Lol, stopped reading at 'patriarchy' Uhh...Diamond points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged inequality between the sexes. You're not very good at reading are you? Maybe you shouldn't have stopped. Hunter/gatherer societies were much more egalitarian, that's just a fact. I would have just say, get the fuck over it.If we didnt learn on how to cultivate and grow crops and depended solely on hunting for food, we, along with the animals would have become extint long back. Uhhh....The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increment in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth. Average height went down from 5'10" (178 cm) for men and 5'6" (168 cm) for women to 5'5" (165 cm) and 5'1" (155 cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels. 
<|endoftext|>I simply smoke. I'm addicted to it but also addicted to taking a quick break alone or possibly with another smoker.
<|endoftext|>I think its disrespectful also. I also find myself doing it! Its messed up but somewhere along the line the priority section of the brain if that exists put text convos higher than most other things. I have to fight the urge to respond or look at the phone, but thats only when I am conscious of the problem. Its like, unless I really concentrate on not doing it, I am going to do it. And I am not even a person that gets texts from people constantly like a lot of people, and the addiction is strong in me.
<|endoftext|>Do you think smartphone addiction is any different from being addicted to computers? Computers / internet offer the same thing.

<|endoftext|>you probably have an addictive personality in general. not saying that to downplay what you're saying at all, but I might be the exact opposite of you as far as that goes. I don't drink or smoke anything and never had the desire to. On that same token I can forget my phone at home or work and not notice till I'm about to go to sleep and set my alarms. I can absolutely see how someone can have trouble with that though. I see it everyday actually, so the risk is def out there.Also, one last thing, good on you for breaking the drug habit man. Stay vigilant 
<|endoftext|>I didnt say I dont believe, I jsut think the new 5G networks will fuck us harder than just one wifi network, especially here in europe where 10 different companies all put their own network.
<|endoftext|>Yeah I graduated 2010 like I said my age puts me in direct conflict. 26-29 ur Olds right now are struggling. It's so hard to date.. I meet a girl even 2 years younger than me and I can't get them off their phones/social media. I don't want to date a wannabe Instagram model that needs constant attention. I keep having so many failed relationships just because these young woman have a constant, incessant need for attention and to be entertained.. And I'm OK with doing nothing and just enjoying time together.. But than they get bored and want to be on their phones, running around being a hoe.. It's rough being on the precipice of this divide and very few people understand this plight.

The most secure phone I've found so far is [this one]( Though I'd like to share an anecdote: a friend of my brother was minister of justice and his phone was something my brother had never seen before. It also had a dongle that encrypted everything. So the governments of out world protect themselves but would like to keep us out of that loop.
<|endoftext|>I'm from Alaska.. Everyone I know turned to heroin addicts over night.. I was the only one who actually started down that path from a car crash that destroyed my back and was actually prescribed these pills. I truly believe HAARP is screwing with peoples brain waves.. Everyone I know who stayed back home after hs turned to an addict. I was finally able to break the curse when I moved to AZ.. There is a power plant outside my front door now.. I feel it's energy constantly and haven't slept right in months. I finally cut out the bs and sugar and tons of meat from my diet and started eating healthy and taking care of my body and I feel better than I ever have in my adult life.. But I swear I'm constantly being attacked by different pitches of ringing in my head and it's not just tinnitus. 
<|endoftext|>I've tried ecigs that are like cigs ehookahs and expensive vapes. I dislike vaping a great deal. The only time I've liked it was when vaping CBD and I have had many disposable vapes for herb and wax for bud or a mix of bud or dabs and CBD dabs. With any type of substance I prefer to just smoke it. Even with dabs I found myself just putting the wax in $1 foil pipes and firing it constantly. I prefer smoking plant material in cig or rolled form. I just can't do the vapes. I have an herb vape that didn't arrive in time for my trip to Denver so I'll probably just sell it. Many folks have recommended juul but it seems like there's more nicotine in them and I already smoke a ton. I can see myself juuling and smoking and upping my intake. Back when I smoked a lot of pot I mixed tobacco in and was smoking more than I am now.
<|endoftext|>Hell yes, I take Lions mane- that stuff is the bomb. I do eat meat though (all pasture raised)- I tend to follow the principles of the Weston Price diet. 
<|endoftext|>Eh yeah I feel you. I definitely felt the same about vaping. I do smoke way less now (measured by 1 Juul pod=~1 pack). If you ever decide to try down the road of quitting but can't quite yet, it's a viable option.
<|endoftext|>So if VPNs don't work why are so many companies still using them to access their internal networks from remote locations successfully? edit: you did'nt say why they dont work, so please give a direct reason they won't work in the situation I described
<|endoftext|>The solution that I've found is based on decentralization. We need to break the monopoly of force nation states wield. I hear all the time on this sub and others that corporations and money are the root of evil. Well, I disagree with this statement. Evil corporations are nothing without a state power structure propping them up. Left to their own devices, most of these parasitical companies that exploit people and countries for profit would crumble to the ground if funds dried up. That's impossible if our tax dollars continue to fund them. If we really want to change the world for the better, we first have to break the monopoly of government, and stop funding our own demise and enslavement.Blockchain technology could be our saving grace in this new world. It provides a base for immutable transactions and documentation. Some of the things it can provide is documentation of property ownership, monetary transactions, vital records, and voting tallies. Blockchain technology has the ability to make government centralized authority and record keeping obsolete. In addition, it removes power from the banking system.If we really want a more peaceful and just world, I think we need to start finding alternatives and working together, independently. Ignore the current system and start building your own. We have the technology, now we just need the numbers.Using force to make people do things is not a solution. Making people comply to your demands will only lead to resentment and conflict. People should be free to make their own decisions and self-organize. People have the right to live their own lives. One of the main problems that we have in this world is that other people believe they have the right to tell others what to do.You really want to change the world? Stop trying to control people, and mind your own damn business. Be the change you wish to see in the world, and live by the Non-aggression Principle. 
<|endoftext|>Step 1. Abolish the Federal ReserveStep 2. Create a bank democratically controlled by the people. Print a new fiat currency backed by gold and our natural resources.Step 3. Create a new court system to prosecute those who created the financial and environmental disasters of the last 100 years.Step 4. Use the wealth gained to create sustainable surpluses of food, housing, and energy. Methods such as vertical farming combined with solar and geothermal are realistic. Scarcity is a myth.Thats my 4 step plan. I hope you enjoyed it. For some more solutions, [Paul Stamets - 6 ways mushrooms can save the world]( is a must watch. Stamets is a real life hero. This quote by him is highly relevantWe are now fully engaged in the sixth Major Extinction (6 X) on planet Earth. Our biosphere is quickly changing, eroding the life support systems that have allowed humans to ascend. Unless we put into action policies and technologies that can cause a course correction in the very near future, species diversity will continue to plummet, with humans not only being the primary cause, but one of the victims. What can we do? Fungi, particularly mushrooms, offer some powerful, practical solutions, which can be put into practice now.[The Corbett Report]( is also a great solutions resource.
<|endoftext|>We need to focus on ways of promoting empathy in children and basically breeding sociopathy out of our species. When it comes down to it, the root of all our worst problems is the fact that sociopaths have an advantage in getting to positions of power and a greater desire for power. If we can somehow screen for it or eradicate it then everything would become so much easier to solve. Or bypass it somehow, by building a society in which decency honesty and kindness are prized above all else-fuck knows how to achieve that though!

<|endoftext|>The solution to poverty is simple. End all foreign aid. Failing financial systems, failing governments, overpopulation, etc are all problems that will correct for themselves if given the chance. Foreign aid is not humanitarian, it is just couched in these terms to continue the vast profits and global influence so called charitable organisations make.They destabilize local farming and manufacturing. No one can compete with free. They then use this destabilization to lower the cost of future investment, taking over entire economies after destroying them.It sounds harsh, but these problems will solve themselves faster without intervention.
<|endoftext|>This is slightly off the original topic but upon pondering the question I thought of Parenting. If you have a child or have nieces, nephews, neighbors, etc, they need you in their life. They need trustworthy mentors in order to be emotionally stable, self-actualize and find meaning in the world. Having a positive impact in a kids life and really showing them how to have confidence, seek knowledge, respect the earth (im a farmer), think for themselves but also respect traditions and their elders are some of the most important things you can do with the breath in your lungs. I have friends with 3 or 4 kids that are well behaved and friendly and I just think how nice it is and how important it is for the future for people to take that responsibility seriously.
<|endoftext|>If humanity is going to survive and thrive on this planet, were going to have to learn to govern ourselves better and work together. Right now most governments in the world are oligarchic (like the United States) or straight-up authoritarian. We need to establish a more civil society, work through our differences to solve problems and preserve our freedoms, and end rule by elites. I'm reluctant to advocate for any particular group, so here's a page with lots of groups working on these types of issues. Some are nonpartisan, others progressive or conservative. Lots of important work happening. Throw them some support if you can. 
<|endoftext|>to whomever it may concern, know this: the general public is intentionally being eased into a distrustful and a conspiratorial worldview. Questionable events are deliberately staged and made to appear suspicious, for the purpose that people will investigate, following bread crumb trails laid out in psyops on the internet and organizing around them. Those who follow the trails will eventually discover the occult, working together to illuminate themselves into higher spiritual consciousness, and overthrow the present system, replacing it with a new and spiritually enlightened world order. This is the true agenda of the demonic forces who pull the strings in the world, and it is an irreversible trap for every single person who is on board. For many years I have known this, [and you may read further if you wish.]( reader: [Jesus Christ truly rose from the dead.]( | [Evidence overwhelmingly authenticates that Jesus Christ came from God.]( | [This very period of history is foretold ahead of time in the New Testament.]( | [I, myself, am a witness, and there is no reason that I would lie.]( is some Scripture I curated,]( with the hope that it will help to illustrate some of these things. Maybe you've never looked at Scripture before. I've tried to keep it as digestible as possible, for those without any background knowledge. Even if you disbelieve, evaluate it.thanks for reading. Cheers everybody.
<|endoftext|>The world has major economic woes. People struggle to get enough food, clean water, basic sanitation and medicine.To remedy this, we need to start by developing a space economy. u/FreedomIntensifies made an incredible comment about building a large satellite to harvest solar power that deserves to be read in its entirety, but the benefits are summarized as: can be completed within 2-3 years (less than one term in office) costs up to $30 trillion but generates $18 trillion in revenue per year upon completion (costs are very, very conservative high end estimates as you will see later and ~$5T is more reasonable but I dont want to oversell)  at the end of 4 years, you have a net profit of $6T plus $18T in revenue every year thereafterWe could also build something like an [orbital ring]( and attach a space elevator to it to dramatically lower launch costs, enable power to be transmitted to the surface using a wire instead of wirelessly (more efficient), and can be used as a high speed rail system for terrestrial transport, due to the almost nonexistant wind resistance in space.In addition to generating solar power in space, we would also open up the [$100 trillion]( market for asteroid mining. This is the type of thing that could pay off the national debt with just a few missions, and dramatically lower the cost of many goods for everyone on earth.While fusion is being developed and may become a better alternative in the future, [thorum-based fission reactors]( are another option to dramatically lower human misery. They offer the ability to produce energy at a much lower cost than any conventional form of electricity generation with very little nuclear waste. In addition, they can be used for things like nuclear desalination of water, which will help reduce the millions of annual deaths because *many of our fellow human beings can't get water that doesn't have shit in it*.Finally, put the lawyers and the bankers in camps.
<|endoftext|>copy pasta from u/Jac0b777 but is really goodit's time to focus on the solutions. We have all the power in the world to turn the game around. Let's do it. (self.conspiracy)submitted 12 hours ago * by Jac0b777The vast majority of this community (as well as many outside it) are well aware of what is going on in the world. Even if we cannot pinpoint exactly what is the root cause of what's happening or the people behind the madness, we know that things cannot go on the way they are. Even people that are not open to the idea of the world's current state being the result of a conspiracy know we cannot keep doing what we are doing, as the end result will be the endless suffering of humanity in a dystopian nightmare and a ravaged planet with a destroyed biosphere.Spreading awareness is fantastic, but as awareness is spread about the world's ills, so too fear and hopelessness is spread with it, like a shadow that never leaves it. There are endless pieces of information and leaks coming out that show insane amounts of corruption and psychopathy among the tiny minority and the majority of "order followers" that go along with it, even if deep inside their heart is telling them to stop.But within all the leaks, the theories, the issues.... we rarely find calls for solutions. We rarely see any encouragement and call for action in what YOU can do in order to make this world better and humanity freer. Because do not kid yourself, the ultimate reason humanity is in the situation it is in is the result of the choices it has made. If there is a minority that is conspiring against the majority in order to gain all the wealth and power for themselves, it is because the majority have allowed this to happen, through their own passivity, ignorance and ultimately unconsciousness.But with new choices come new results. And we desperately need new choices, so new results can flourish. Ultimately, this needs to happen on the level of the individual. The individual needs to change their life and choices and the more individuals can do this, the more the fire will spread. One person can affect many, by his thoughts, actions and example. Those he affects in turn affect others....and so the fire spreads until it engulfs as all. Those that do not wish to participate and choose to selfishly turn a blind eye on the rest, will have themselves and their descendants engulfed in the suffering as humanity and this planet crumbles. In my opinion there is a definite light at the end of the tunnel. But movement towards it has to accelerate now, in no past or future is this possible.So what can we do on the level of the individual? Here are some of my ideas on the subject (feel free to add to this list in the comments, any more solutions would obviously be very useful):-Take care of your health. The only way you can make a change is if you take care of the body you are in. My suggestions on this: Exercise, eat healthy food, engage in breathing exercises (I heavily recommend breathing through your nose at all times, yes even during exercise - I recommend the book 'The Oxygen Advantage' by Patrick Mckeown for further details). What should you eat? Whatever your body truly wants. I will not recommend diets to you, only awareness. If you are aware when you eat, during, after and before eating, of your body and mind, you will notice what food makes you feel better, stronger, happier (yes food affects mood), makes your mind clearer.... Connect to your body, listen to it and you will know what to eat. This is how I cured my massive gastrointestinal issues. I could recommend my diet to you, but I won't, instead I'm recommending awareness, which will give you the optimal personalized diet for your body.-Take care of your mind and embrace what is beyond your thoughts. You may not agree and you do not have to, but in my experience, the root state of all being (beyond all the pain, the fog of suffering) is one of peace. I encourage you to engage in meditative and introspective practice and find this out for yourself. Meditate, write your thoughts down on a paper and destroy it, introspect, look within embrace your pain and let it go (maybe this practice can be of help  Embracing & Dissolving Inner Suffering, it is something I wrote a while back)the more of the inner fog you let go of and the more you focus on the present moment, as well as the inherent peace, freedom, love and gratitude that are present in it and root you inside it, the more you will become a beacon of light in this world that so desperately needs it. -Be aware of how you spend your money. Your money is your energy. By spending it you are supporting and giving energy to whatever it is that you are spending it on. Companies that act unlawfully, that are destroying the planet, killing and abusing, torturing animals (including for scientific experiments), enslaving people and bringing devastation to third world countries.... should be avoided whenever possible. Yes, I understand, sometimes this is not possible (for financial or other reasons). But if you just start to take that into account more as you buy things and spend your money, you will be making a difference, even if it's a small one. This can be done with food (where you support small farmers instead of big corporations, organic food instead of GMOs, companies that care about the environment and animals more than those that don't), it can be done with software (supporting open source software like Linux instead of Windows...with countless similar examples - I have just switched to Linux and I love it), it can be done with clothing (don't buy clothes you don't need, consider buying used clothes at times, check which companies support less suffering when it comes to the horrible conditions of manual labour in the east - many times you cannot avoid this fully, but you can mitigate it),......But also, don't buy things you don't need and if you have something extra that you don't need anymore, consider giving it away (or even selling it if you need the money).-Spread awareness on the issues that matter, but always add possible solutions to the table. As I said in the beginning, spreading awareness is crucial, but doing so with an energy of hopelessness and fear is detrimental. Show the world what needs to be seen, but always add the possibility of changing the situation around, think of solutions and avenues of action that can make said situation or event better. Expose the dark, but don't dwell in it - find ways to turn into the light.-Value your community. Friends and family are precious - in any world that is truly free, the impact of those that are closest to you will be heightened. The impact of those you care about as well as those that live near you is important. Be kind and generous to them, offer a helping hand if they need your assistance and you can give it. But above all, try to accept them as they are and see beyond their faults. If anyone close to you has hurt you, forgive them. Also remember, you do not need to have people in your life 
<|endoftext|>"Alternatives to current forms of government" That, my friend, is the most overlooked topic. And you cant discuss having a new political paradigm without discussing economics. Philosophically and in practice, the government by definition controls and "regulates" a naturally anarchistic free market economy.Rule #1 for any new future government attempting to be in the peoples best interest:NO BAILOUTS.That is probably the most important thing that is underestimated when it comes to the publics long term benefit.Our constitution has a lot of salvageable concepts as well such as freedom of speech, religion, and the press at its foundation. Not to mention the 2nd and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures which has been shit on soooo hard.These things need to be looked at not as laws necessarily, but as creating the best environment for human success.Sure, the creators of this nation are not perfect and neither is the Constitution; Which may seem like a bold statement to some, but it's really not. (Even though I still believe it the best document written to limit government power and maintain human rights, to date)Government and politics should be a heavily scrutinized and evolving concept as it always has been. To feel that we are at the pinnacle of human organization is folly.
<|endoftext|>Breaking Free of the Overton WindowOne of the biggest Overton Windows is showing people that the government taxing people is not necessary. Instead of the government generating its income from its citizens/businesses, it should look elsewhere to generate that income. Solutions for generating income include(off the top of my head):* Tariffs* Space Elevator (Use this to deploy Solar Panels to sell energy to the rest of the world, Asteroid Mining, Space Farming, Space Manufacturing, etc)* NAWAPA* Nationwide Hyperloop Network (The government could build this and take a portion of the sales to fund itself)* Replacing the Fed with (Third Bank of the United States... similar to the Bank of North Dakota)* Thorium Nuclear Reactors (Meltdown proof, would lower current energy costs by 50%, used to desalinate/distill water)* If countries want our military presence for intervention, they should cut a check to Uncle SamIm sure there's more... if some random noob on reddit can catalogue these, what are our politicians doing?&#x200B;
<|endoftext|>Its may seem small, but I think supporting local organic farms could be an important first step in a direction we should want to go in.   
<|endoftext|>The current regime in both worlds - this sub and this political epoch - expresses its intentions by posing them as solutions. But in nearly every case the original problem is in serious contention.We were told that Islamic extremism was the problem. We were told the population growth was the problem. We were told the burning of fossil fuels was the problem. The solutions imposed: continuous war, targeted depopulation, and the seizure of the atmosphere by geotechnology.Clearly the current power structure first manufactures the problem and then implements a predetermined solution. Interestingly, the problem is never the existing power structure and their transparent bogus problem-solution strategy.In my opinion the planet is entering a new phase and nobody really knows what metamorphosis is underway. We now need to think radically askew (non-orthogonal). Problems ARE solutions. Solutions ARE problems. Time can and must advance and return in all directions. We are each an infinitely dense gravity well connected with every other. 
<|endoftext|>The solution is Paul Wellstone, JFK, JFK Jr., RFK, MLK Jr., Malcolm X, Dennis Kucinich, Cynthia McKinney, Gary Webb, Mike Connell, Danny Casolaro, Gary Caradori, Pat Tillman, Dr. David Kelly, Barry Jennings, Dr. David Graham, Seth Rich. The country would be different if these people were allowed to live.Foreign leaders such as Gaddafi, Hussein, Allende, etc would have also been solutions instead of the downfall their societies underwent after their murders.The solution is exposing these deaths, preventing more from happening in the future, and exposing the false flag operations that have haunted our development throughout history.
<|endoftext|>I've been collecting some potential solutions here:  thinking about this for some time, I think the most effective way we can do anything meaningful is through boycott. A complete boycott of the military industrial complex. Boycott helped to turn South Africa around and is at the forefront of Israel criticism. The elites are all about harvesting cash from us, so why wouldn't we start there?We can all easily change whom we bank with, what our 401k retirement funds are supporting, and what we buy. But will you put your money where your mouth is and accept some inconvenience in order to stop funding the war machine?Also these guys are on it and are actually making a difference, with successful legislation passed in multiple states: 
<|endoftext|>Does anyone know how much 3d space as in stacked dirt shelves or stack aqua or hydroponocs it takes to feed a single person. How big would a system need to be to feed one person?Could it fit in every single apartment? Seems like getting those automated and in every apartment would do a lot to change the world.Obviously would need to be electrically powered for grow lights but that another issue.
<|endoftext|>We need to eliminate and destroy weather machines. Tax the wealthy globally and appropriately. Fund private investigators to determine who holds the profits from human trafficking. Eliminate all debt in the United States by discovering where the 21 trillion went. Eliminate any trade tariffs domestically and globally. Provide universal higher education and health insurance and legalize marijuana. Eliminate all GMOs and proven dangerous pesticides.
<|endoftext|>1. Stop taking loans, and work hard to repay individual debts, abolish taxes, destroy money(render money useless)2. Everyone knows and does everything themselves by sharing knowledge(from growing food to building houses) 3. Eliminate the police and army and let people defend themselves and their property by any means necessary4. Stop sending children to school, instead parents teach their kids(stop the viscious cycle of consumerism)5. Live by simple rules( Don't hurt/kill others, don't steal other's property)6. Property defined as amount of space a family can use to feed themselves and shelter themselves7. Be kind and helpful to neighbors and develop a sense of community and empathy among people living in close proximity
<|endoftext|>become the change you want for the world. Exersice more, eat healthy, stop consuming what you dont need, be mindfull of yourself and the people around you. Reproduce and be a good parent. Have good kids and a nice family. If you and likeminded people keep this up somewere down the road there is going to be a critical mass of good people on earth, we can start turning things around then.
<|endoftext|>We need a "soulution"Someone probably said that already. But if not, yeah, free our minds spirits and those of others.Raise the new ones better.Obstain from bullshit pop culture, be conscious of how we "vote" by spending our money.Love others, hear them out and maybe be able to get a word in edgewise.Trying to change someone's mind in an aggressive manner can do more harm at times, although it's difficult with the world burning.Lead good lives and just spread the truth.We manifest reality to an extent, so just stay positive and chamge how we react to the negative things.I think Jesus is quoted(or an apostle) something along the lines of "Be in the world; not of it"Organize people to make positive changes. Exposing the snakes is good and all until you shoot yourself in the back of the head 3 times.If we evolve past needing them they won't have power over us.Let their corruption expose itself as we do what we can.No great revolt will make a difference if we are still sick in our souls.
<|endoftext|>The only viable solutions first require the self-organization of the working class, be it around alternative political movements, alternative currencies, alternative economic institutions, alternative media, or whatever. Unless that happens, any attempt to create a new system will inevitable be violently attacked, economically strangled, and vilified in the culture, as has happened to most such attempts throughout history. Without that organization too, even if some effort to resist TPTB succeeded, itd only result in the changing of the figure heads atop the same old system.Read Murray Bookchin.
<|endoftext|>I am glad this went through, and I'd like to thank those that made it happen, and those that take an interest, because I fully believe we can make a difference. I will be adding my 2 cents to the other comments shortly here, but for now I'd like to talk about exposure. For those that haven't had a chance, I'd like you to read a couple posts, and for a short disclaimer, my short descriptions do these posts no justice, I believe these posts can save the world.: **This post talks about our place in the world.**Community Service - In between the dust and the dust:  **This post has a brilliant 30 day plan for ending poverty, and ultimately the entire plauge that we as humanity face.** Let's Talk About Food:  **This post talks about where we are at right now in humanity**You've changed humanity, and not for the better:  u/PieceOfChance I would like to hear your thoughts on this solutions round table. Back to exposure, that is a problem we face, the "conspiracy theorist" lable is killing us, even though those that believe in the propoganda we are fed, are literal conspiracy theorists, example is russian collusion. There is a grand conspiracy that is the reason for where this world is right now and in the past. Just about everybody in the world, see's something they don't like, but they don't attribute these things to their main cause. Divided we fall right? We need proper exposure, and for that we need to unite under all the problems. Exposure, I'd like to see posts like the ones I've shared above, printed in mass, and littered throughout the cancer that is cities for all to see. Internet trends.... Saddens me to fucking say this, but we need a fucking pound sign, or rather an octothorpe, I mean a hashed tag. A group name.... Ask yourself now, "what am I?" Me personally, I am a human, born into this world with you and our problems. I think life has to be some sort of fucking game, this world is so fucked, what if you, I or we fuckin fixed it? In our entire recorded.... Think about that, entire recorded history.... Humanity has been losing, orwell explained it perfectly: Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. The internet.... We can reach the entire world in seconds, let's trend.... We are the hashtag SomethingIsFuckingWrong party?  We need the technology that we have already, we need food(If you havn't read the let's talk about food post above, do it now), we need shelter, we need a means of exchange, world wide... Things can be done differently though, a rich life could be gaurenteed for all of humanity. Bickering will never work, fuck... I want to limit our speech... Something is fucking wrong with the entire world, that is our problem. We need to stress as our main cause, that something is wong, and we can rid life of these parasites in control.We are the only species on earth that can actually change it... Let's fucking do it. Peace and love to you all.
<|endoftext|>I was asked to copy and paste this comment I made in a thread from r/C_S_T.I believe a basic universal income needs to be discussed and considered more. There are too many people that are struggling to survive, when the country has all the means to help. We will not be changing anything else about our economy, leaving the free market and workplace in place. Not much will change regarding these things. People tend to want more than food, shelter, and healthcare, so most will still work jobs and continue to start and continue careers. The argument that the people receiving this will not get jobs and will become miserable is simply ridiculous. People are living off of welfare as it is, these people will continue that whether it is implemented or not. The people who want more, will still get jobs, and still work to provide a better life for themselves and their families. This so why we need to keep the free market and capitalistic ideals we currently have. A universal income will allow peak innovation. More people who have ideas for products, businesses, and anything else that requires some risk and some money to attempt will do so, because they no longer need to worry about feeding, housing, and caring for themselves and their family. The fact of the matter is, most people will not take these risks, because it puts them in a place that can possibly endanger them and their familys lively hoods. Implementing a basic universal income will allow them to take these risks while still knowing they will be okay if it doesnt work out. There are many problems that come with it, as with ANY economical idea, and it is by no means a perfect system. Simply implementing it as is would be disastrous. That being said, there needs to be deeper discussion on it, and will need some manipulating and change for the idea to be a better fit for current society. 
<|endoftext|>How bout a pay system based on Energy level & Skilled Output, and not just the 'pay by the hour' half-measure? Money needs to be the motivation again, not just a single place where we spend all of our time. The current system in place works when everybody uses it correctly, but in the world of low profile pyramid schemes, obscure monopolies, and minimum wage normalities, your efforts are largly outstepped by just doing things 'not to get fired from here.' Profit and Potential is quelled by the black hole of the timeclock.
<|endoftext|>We need social media 2.0 like collaborative web2.0 where digital cooperative groups collaborate in their R&D efforts to make projects that help people. Physical Co-Ops could utilize the R&D, operating as a mentorship program to uplift participants. Could use proof of value cryptocurrency to incentivise participation, and then currency would only be made when members collaborate on a socially uplifting project together. This is the TLDR version of what I fucks with
<|endoftext|>Lots of people here are striking out at the bigger picture solutions and that's fucking awesome. Rather than go on and try to retread ground about Anarchism, decentralization, etc; I will go for some lower hanging fruit.Within the political system of the American Republic are two main Parties- currently inhabiting the 5th Party System. Through these two Parties virtually *all* US politicians and political ideas arise. Therefore, before we can change fundamentals about the Nation State or International relations, we must first gain control of our own system. Before we can reform voting and allow for even more Parties to be created, we first have to storm the existing ones.Taking a Party is far easier than many believe- and the knowledge of how to do so is kept intentionally obscure and irrelevant to most people. But the answers are there- publicly available.For an example, I will use the Democratic Party. The smallest organizational of the Dem Party is the Precinct. This is the smalles organizational structure of the entire US voting system- you vote by your precinct, which is determined when you register to vote. Any registered Democratic Party member can attend their Precinct meetings. Now the times and locations of these events are usually public information- until activists begin attending. Then, often, that information suddenly becomes harder to find- but not impossible. In fact, it's not legally possible at all to completely hide this information.At Precinct meetings, Precinct Chairs are chosen. This is an individual who is voted, by majority of those in attendance, to become the Precinct Chair for ~1 year. The Party organization scales upwards from here, reflecting the American electoral organization. There is a County Chair, and a State Chair, and a National Chair. The Precinct Chairs vote for the County Chairs, who vote for the State Chairs, who vote for the National Chairs. This is the fundamental bureaucratic structure of *both* Parties. All that is required is registered membership in that Party- a shitty thing to many here, I know- but a necessary evil if we want to begin the path to change. All that is required to take the Precinct Chairs is organization- Finding the meeting time/location, then getting enough registered members there and in agreement on who to vote for. Many of those running these Precinct meetings are aging local Party elders who are absolutely not expecting a surge or a fight for Precinct Chair.This is how we storm the Parties. This is how we force change *up*, from the grassroots. We can not put our faith in Presidents or Congressmen, when they are controlled and selected by a corrupt Party in the first place. We must *storm* the Parties first and foremost, and force them to bow to the Will of the People. 
<|endoftext|>it was said that we create peace through war...  we can just have one final world war and the winner, becomes the leader of the unified earth as one nation - not united nations, but like the US and all the others are just states. then we will have peace, many will die in this generation but how many generations to come will be free from war. 
<|endoftext|>Lets do a first small step thats achievable. Lets remove money from the electoral process. Lets set aside a small amount and once you can gather enough signatures you get your share of it. Thats the only amount that youre allowed to spend. Thats it.Our politicians spend their days begging for money from the first day they enter office. Therefore they only represent the money. Once we have politicians that truly represent the people. Maybe then we will stand a chance. I dont care if it takes a constitutional conference in all 50 states. This is the only path forwards that I see.
<|endoftext|>Money:Society::Blood:BodyBlood is no good if it isn't circulating. People hoarding dollars is no good, like an aneurysm waiting to burst. We won't progress, so long as accumulation of money is the driving goal.You could run the world off of a single dollar, if it circulated fast enough. I thought Bitcoin would usher in the age of plenty, but then you got all those investors trying to hoard wealth, and it all goes back down the shitter.
<|endoftext|>Rojava's system of Democratic Confederalism (based on the philosophies of Murray Bookchin) is as good of a solution as anything I've seen to the question 'So, what's next?'&#x200B;r/rojava 
<|endoftext|>Honestly, the best and most efficient government any kind of culture can have is Socialism. Hypothetically, in socialism the government completely dishes out it's resources and efforts back onto the people. If that socialistic government was GOOD, and actually FOR THE PEOPLE, no other system can even compete with Socialism. Unfortunately, in our world, the government will never be for the people, so socialism is actually bad. Then you got Democracy, complete shit, and even Aristotle pointed this out over 2,000 years ago. The Democracy of people fighting over what they want, opinions are like assholes. The real solution to Democracy with more Democracy is to gather at the local level and establish community-based systems of trade, culture, etc. This will eventually effect the large scale to follow suit.

<|endoftext|>If you consider solutions to our ills, keep in mind the diverse nature of opinion on what a "better system" looks like. If you go to an AnCap, Revolutionary, or Libertarian board, you will hear the same disagreements over and over, and very little in the way of solutions. At the end of the day, if 100 AnCaps cannot agree on whether abortion should be allowed in their society, there is NO HOPE for 30% liberals, 30% conservatives, and 40% moderates to come to an agreement on how we should change. You can "fight the system" all day long, but if you do not have something better to replace it with, you're just wasting your energy. Voluntarism is a principle, it is not a prescription for a working system. If 20% of the population wants something close to Anarcho-Capitalism or Minarchism, and the other 80% do not agree, it is difficult to proceed. Also, you cannot get agreement even in that 20%, so what now? Insanity To try the same thing over and over, expecting different results... is madness. It is futile windbaggery that frustrates and divides. Neophytes with no conception of advanced game theory put forward "solutions" to our ills that almost always revolve around a "one size fits all" model of government.Anyone with any experience in social systems knows that socio-economic systems cannot be accurately modeled with any predictive power. Almost no natural or complex system can be modeled and predicted, period. It doesn't work for monetary theory, political theory, social choice theory or anything complex, whatsoever. The \[geek talk\] exponential complexity of the interactions make predictions almost useless.All you can do is to "test and check". The most advanced neural networks in the world use a repetitive guess and check algorithm that simply keeps guesses that come closer to the goal while throwing away guesses that do not converge on the solution. The is the SMARTEST POSSIBLE WAY to go about designing a complex system.&#x200B;SO... We need a social model that embraces and perfects the guess and check paradigm, and no current solutions adequately take this into consideration. All due respect to Stephan Molyneux, but "practical anarchy" is prescriptive, and if any flaws exist in his complex system will doom it to failure.&#x200B;You could say, "Freedom" is the answer, and to some extent you are right. We need the freedom to try many different things, and the "market of ideas" will weed out the bad ideas and select the good ones. The best possible system to embrace is a system that allows this to occur, and to the layman just entering this intellectual space, and the intransigent veteran, that seems like Libertarianism, until you join a group of libertarians and listen to them battle about the inane. Then it seems like Anarcho-capitalism provides the necessary freedom and structure, and then you get into a group of AnCaps, and the same thing occurs. Finally, you embrace Anarchy and the non-aggression principle in its purest form, and your system gets distilled down to a single principle, with no supporting framework.&#x200B;I don't want to denigrate these systems, because they embrace a valid, natural set of principles, and I will concede that Anarchy might work if everyone embraced the spirit of it, and were willing to give it a try. However, this is not the case. You can blame indoctrination. You can blame the diversity of culture or something bizarre, but it is simply not the case that the 300+ million people around you will embrace the "do it yourself" "radical self reliance" that anarchy requires.&#x200B;Also, anarchy is unorganized by its very nature. If you have two towns, and one is ruled by anarchy and the other is ruled by a despotic regime, the 10k in town A will be attacked by the 10k in town B on some pretense, real or imagined, once conflict over some resource comes into play. Towns C, D, and E will not be organized to help town A, because Anarchy.&#x200B;Anarchy is the natural state of almost every barbarian and native tribe before the monarchs and empires come knocking, and then they are simply vassels of the empire. The history of every region of the world shows this to be true, a thousand times over. \--------------------------------------------ConstructiveThe solution to these problems is a proto-system tailored to embrace and exploit the guess and check paradigm inside a VERY loose framework of interdependence. "Constructive" is a system designed to allow a population of 10 or 10 billion to cooperate towards the efficient construction of a system which MAXIMIZES the amount of support among the population it is composed of. It does this in a very simple, rational way, and it is designed to be quickly modified as new information becomes available. Constructive can be implemented with computers on a blockchain, but it is not dependent on technology to function. Some people don't want to be dependent in whole or even in part on some system of 1's and 0's they don't understand. Any time you join a group in free association, there will be a set of rules/codes that define the benefits and responsibilities of members of that group. If you join a complex group, like /r/conspiracy, there are rules you follow, and you probably don't like all the rules. If you find a group where you agree with ALL the rules, that group almost certainly has one member... You. For all real world groups, you will agree with some percentage of the rules, in order to receive the benefits, and in a very good group, that number is WAAAY over 50%, and your adherence to rules you disagree with is primarily performed for the good of the group and even more so for the expected benefits. A really well functioning voluntary group will contain dozens of rules, not thousands, and you will be able to understand them all. In a great group, you will agree with 80% or 90% of the rules that you follow, and you will follow the other 10% or 20% because the benefits you gain are sufficient to make you voluntarily comply. It stands to reason that if you make rules with the requirement that 51% of the people agree (by vote or something), then 49% of the people potentially disagree with every rule you make. This can result in a system where every rule you agree with is paired with one you disagree with, and that is a crap ratio. You will think that half the rules are stupid, unproductive, or immoral, and inconsistent with your guiding principles (voluntarism).  If I propose a competing system where the only change is that 75% of the people must agree before a rule is adopted, then at the very least, you can surmise that you will agree with 3 rules for every one you disagree with. At 90%, in all probability, you will agree with 9 rules for every rule you disagree with. This is the single biggest number that affects the power of the group over the individual, because there are LOTS AND LOTS of rules that 51% agree with, and VERY, VERY FEW that 90% agree with. It matters less whether you pass rules by representation or direct vote, but this is still important. For this choice, I would prefer a "liquid democracy" model which is mixed representation/direct vote, but I would be okay with a pure direct vote, as long as the level of required consensus is high. Everything I've written so far is dumb simple, but it cannot be overstated that it is the most important part of the foundation that the Constructive system is designed to decide.
<|endoftext|>YES! Decentralized Blockchain Co-Ops. I really really need help and advice about where to begin working on this idea I've had for a while about something similar....As concisely as I can put this, I believe the internet can utilize Collective Consciousness via the collaborative efforts of expert participants who are active members of a hi tech, open source cooperative with physical campuses which physically make and implement the designs of the Collective Consciousness of the Open Source Co-Op.A project example could be that a CIV BLD CO-OP could implement vertical, aquaponic growing systems within greenhouses to extend the growing season for much of the country year round. Permaculture should be all over these communities as well. A project could be Tiny Home Kit Construction for the Co-Op members themselves to "Glamp", going the more high-tech route, it could be liquid fluoride thorium reactors for advanced alt-nuclear sustainable power, setting up tidal power or solar systems. The experiences that could be gained are only limited by the creative and collaborative power of an organized and activist-oriented open source internet co-op.But wait, there's more... I'm interested in harnessing the incentivizing technology of Proof of Value (like backfeed.cc) or Proof of Cooperation (like faircoin) cryptocurrency to encourage voluntary participation of members to assist in the creation and Technical design of these hi tech, socially uplifting Co-Op projects. Blockchain technology is amazing, and I already have an open-source algorithm which could be used to log in user value which would just need a little work. Such a Proof of Value Cryptocurrency in this context could encourage the digital and physical collaboration of participants. POVC would essentially allow members to verify the value the others provide in their participation swith the Co-Op, which creates the currency based on the incremental value added to these socially uplifting projects. I believe that POVC would incentivize and multiply the collaborative power and influence of Co-Ops around the globe, incorporating technological methods of investment and asset growth to socially uplifting projects so that these members can actually gain wealth doing projects that help others. Members receive the increased value of their invested currency as more members participate.Co-Op Members could participate in collaborative research and project development using a social-media like interface, where Co-Op members can actively communicate and submit co-edited (something like) google-spreadsheets to work towards a predetermined and collaboratively specified goal for that work meeting. Think of this as like a google hangout meeting to work on a project, where verified members log their hours, corroborating, verifying, and rating the participation of their co-members. Physical Coop Campuses could be set up as emulation chambers, physically bringing manifest and LIFE to the designs and schematics of an international body of participating experts. We need to use the collaborative technologies of WIKI-style web 2.0 with Social Media that is absolutely conscious and directed to complete goals for the betterment of all of the Co-Op members.Cooperating with others is where you put your soul's work out there, putting your passion into doing work that uplifts those also working to help you. It is also very spiritually and mentally rewarding. I sincerely believe with all my heart that much of the welfare, drug abuse and mental health challenges hing on the lack of community that individuals placed in unfortunate economic situations are situated in. WE, as the Agora need to MAKE CIVILIZATION BUILDING CO-OPS so that individuals have a place to gain mentorship and valuable experience while also being sufficiently rewarded based on the value of that individual's merit and participation. I have a vision that Open Source, Campus Co-Ops can make greedy corporations and inept governments obsolete. Where do I begin? 
<|endoftext|>Wouldnt taking the financial system away from people who know double entry bookkeeping and giving that power to people who know computer theory cause a relatively large group to be replaced by a relatively smaller group (based on the relatively simpler math involved)?I have some small acquaintance with computer programmers.

<|endoftext|>You have a way with words, sir. This is the most clearly and impactful ive seen the message written.I even felt a feeling of hope while reading your comment
<|endoftext|>It's no use. The Fed will shut down the blockchain if it gets too powerful. They already announced that they have the power to track down private key identities. It won't be too long now before we see Holodomor 2.0. The Federal Reserve does its best to exist in perpetuity, enslaving more and more while the two dominant gangs fight for quasi control to keep everyone distracted. Slavery too will be perpetual. It's no use to look for alternatives, we will die and our estates will be taxed and given to the Fed. 
<|endoftext|> Step 3. Create a new court system to prosecute those who created the financial and environmental disasters of the last 100 years. Ex post facto bills of attainder are probably not the best way to kick off our new super society and theyre pointlessly vengeful. If you can just stop the pollution and the cheating theres no need. Dont punish people for participating in the last broken society if youre making a new one- declare amnesty and move on. Only bad things can come from the deprivation of due process- witch hunts, civil conflict, systemic barbarism, etc. Your favorite scapegoat might not be mine so what happens when everyone is 2 steps away from punishable traitor? Its easy to see a corrupt person with authority using that to remove whoever they want.
<|endoftext|>Highly recommend the Public Banking Institute for anyone interested in reducing the power of Wall Street. 
<|endoftext|>We also need to get in there when the budding psychopath is a child, because at that point there is still a chance at some semblance of rehabilitation. When we try to rehabilitate fully grown psychopaths they only become all the more deviant, as if it's a game to them to see how well they can convince you that they've changed for the better while really going in the opposite direction.
<|endoftext|>I disagree. Children have tons of empathy, but the system beats it out of you. Today's money-driven world is all about putting yourself before others. No one is gonna look out for you, so you're forced to look out for yourself. Empathy isn't going to pay rent, put food on the table, or generate a livelihood in the world we live in. Instead of hoping that empathy is going to change the world, we should focus on changing the system that rewards sociopathy and punishes empathy. 
<|endoftext|>What about encouraging kids to become politicians? It seems that politician is such a dirty word that sociopaths end up running rather than ethical working folks.
<|endoftext|>I think its materialism that does this. Humility has been a virtue in every successful society throughout history except those about to fall (Egypt/Rome/us). We lost our humility because we made it the ultimate good to have things. New is always better which leads to throwaway culture in relationships and politics as well as just possessions. Sociopathy is a manageable trait in most societies, theres a reason we in particular struggle with it.
<|endoftext|>I think we have plenty of empathy these days to be honest. It's used as a political tactic to promote bad policies like gun control and open borders. A non-politically biased and non-postmodern education in history, economics and other subjects is absolutely essential in not growing up to be a resentful, angry, fact-less, skill-less person (source: am millennial. I managed to accomplish this but most of my generation has not.)

<|endoftext|>I think foreign aid in the form of cash might be beneficial. Poor people know what they need more than anyone else, and with cash in hand they can get it. Imagine what would have happened in Haiti if that half a billion dollars squandered by the Red Cross, had been put in envelopes and distributed directly to the people. I bet more than six houses would have been built. 
<|endoftext|>do you have any proof of this, or anything compelling to watch on the subject? Not questioning you, just intrigued
<|endoftext|>I wouldn't say completely end foreign aid, but certainly be *far* more discretionary with who we send it to, and with the type of aid that we send. This includes charity organizations as well.
<|endoftext|>Many people are poor for reasons that money can't fix. If you've ever watched a schizophrenic homeless person brought into the hospital for the 50th time because they stopped taking their (free) meds and in acute psychosis, you would understand this.Many people are poor in ways that CAN be fixed, but we'll never completely eradicate poverty.Half the population has an IQ less than 100. Many have an IQ less than 80. Money doesn't fix this.
<|endoftext|>Foreign aid is a tiny fraction of a percent of the budget and is mostly used for political clout. For reasons completely separate from foreign aid, abject poverty is massively down and education is massively up. This just isnt really an issue.
<|endoftext|>Except humans are flawed to the core.Doesn't matter how much parenting you do if your own beliefs are wrong in the first place.
<|endoftext|>While the democracies of the world accept political "donations", or allow outside parties to advertise for campaigns, it will never truly be free.We need politicians to be upright and for the people, and not for their own gains. Be it cash now, failing to do anything about out of control housing prices because they have investment properties, giving favours to connected people or even leveraging their position for a job after office.The world has gotten so much worse since we became more greedy, and politicians are the worst as they are favouring money over people
<|endoftext|>FYI "progressive" is not synonymous with "liberal", and "liberal" and "conservative" are not parties (hence the term "nonpartisan" does not apply to them).
<|endoftext|> to whomever it may concern, know this: the general public is intentionally being eased into a distrustful and a conspiratorial worldview. Questionable events are deliberately staged and made to appear suspicious, for the purpose that people will investigate, following bread crumb trails laid out in psyops on the internet and organizing around them. Wow. That is an interesting theory. The false flags have been especially sloppy lately, and they're finally getting some traction in places that normies will see them (Tucker Carlson on Las Vegas, for example).I'm not sure that I agree that it's all about bringing people into demonic occultism, at least not on a conscious level for the people that are exposing the false flags. Many of them are Christians, and the rest are mostly "light" occultists, who don't see themselves as consciously following demons, although they often are.
<|endoftext|>part 2simply because they are your relatives - if someone has hurt you forgive them, but if they continue with their unconsciousness, you do not need to keep them in your life. Free your own mind and improve your own life and you will slowly (or quickly) find new people and communities that resonate with your greater awareness (I can tell you this is true from my personal experience - it can take a while, but as you grow, some people will grow with you, while others will not and you will find others that you resonate with more in that moment/period of your life).-Create and give birth to something new. Creativity is crucial for a new Earth to flourish. In whatever way you feel moved to, create. Whether you enjoy writing, singing, dancing, painting, talking.... use your creative energy to make the world better, to bring light and awareness to various issues, to spread freedom, love and joy, as well as to express yourself and bring your own darkness to light.-Consider spending more time in nature. Reconnecting to nature will give you a greater love for this planet, for both humanity and the rest of the biosphere. You will feel yourself more a part of nature, rather than as a separate human trying to conquer it (the idea that has caused so much suffering to humanity).-Have compassion. One of the main reasons humanity is where it is, is a lack of compassion. There is a small group of individuals, that we could call psychopaths or sociopaths who do not have this empathy. This is a tiny minority, but most of these people are in the vast majority of positions of power. Thus the system is the way it is, because it is designed by those that lack compassion and THAT is reverberated throughout the whole society we live in. Practice looking at others with a perspective of compassion, empathy, looking at it through their eyes, noting how their intention might be different than their actions...practice compassion, primarily for yourself, then for those closest to you and ultimately for all living beings. You will be much happier and at peace with yourself and others, your relationships will be far better and more harmonious and you will be doing a great service to the whole of humanity. Accept yourself unconditionally, that is the doorway to self-compassion.-Be aware. It is from this that everything else stems from and it is in this that everything ends. If you become more aware of what is actually happening around you and focus less on the preconceived mental/emotional abstractions that color your world (and are often wrong), you will see things like never before. As they say in Zen, you will look at things with a beginner's mind. Becoming aware will make you intuitively discern things with far greater ease. When you are not trying to control your mind and your incessant thinking, you will find that your mind is far more lucid and cooperative. By moving your awareness beyond your limiting thoughts, you will find insights and truths, as well as inner peace and freedom you did not even imagine ever could exist. Being aware is the key. You are either entrapped in your thoughts or you are aware of them. You do not need to stop your limiting thoughts, all you need to is become aware of them. You do not need to stop your thinking, just become aware that you are constantly thinking. Awareness is the light that shines into the darkness and transforms it into itself. You just have to let it.-Consider that there might be more to life than the physical. Here I am delving into territory that might not be for all, as beliefs and convictions are strong in peoples minds when it comes to the topic of spirituality. When it comes to this, you should not believe a thing, but always test everything out and see what is true for you. Curiosity and a desire for freedom are the things that will make you inspect yourself and reality, closer than you have done so far. Although reading about this topic can be insightful, I strongly recommend the practical approach. Find a spiritual practice, a form of meditation, prayer, perhaps a chant, a form of introspection, that you resonate and resonates with you  and see where it takes you. My perspective on this goes as follows - Fundamentally, you will notice that there is a freedom, a joy, a love, that stems from the silence, from the space, from the absolution of our reality. It is always here now, yet unnoticed. This beingness is the core of all there is and is the source of you as well. Become aware of the silence, the stillness and the emanation of even the faintest peace, love or joy in this very moment. This is incredibly simple, but not easy, as your mental programming will take your attention back to the inner fog. Embrace the stillness and it will grow. This, in my opinion, is the most important and fastest way to change yourself and the world. Embracing the freedom, the stillness and following its light will lead you to action and results that will be massively beneficial for yourself and the world.Trust in Life, it knows the way and it is ultimately not separate from who you are.________________________________________(if you want to know more of my perspective, especially on the points pertaining to inner peace, freedom and spirituality, you can also check out my blog  embraceyourexperience.com) ________________________________________I wish you all a pleasant day and a wonderful life :)
<|endoftext|>Environment for human success but also the individual. So much is bunched up to help success but it is a fragile success. A difficult success by individuals is a more sound foundation for government or corporate governance. 
<|endoftext|>As per generating money from energy.... Money isn't even real, money is printed out of thin air by a select few, and distrubuted to slaves.
<|endoftext|>Excellent article/study. I've joked about this concept for years with my work friends.Also, this is a sad-funny image that describes the first part of this century perfectly:
<|endoftext|>This is why the REAL problem is a lack of empathy. Empathy is the inbuilt tool that can save us if we can find a way to value it more than anything else and a way to ensure those without it (sociopaths) are never allowed power.
<|endoftext|>The solution is exposing these deaths, preventing more from happening in the future, and exposing the false flag operations that have haunted our development throughout history.well said. "zero point", UBI, and all other transformative solutions will never happen unless the current roadblocks are exposed.transparency is a must. knowledge is power.

<|endoftext|>Sounds a little like Barret Browns pursuance project. Co-ops do have huge potential, I think that's the non-corporate solution everyone is longing for.
<|endoftext|>We need social media 2.0 like collaborative web2.0 where digital cooperative groups collaborate in their R&D efforts to make projects that help people.wouldn't hurt :)
<|endoftext|>Well... Good luck with all that. You're trying to use the system to beat the system. Even IF you win... It's still THE SYSTEM. You haven't changed shit. That's like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.If you still think you can vote yourself free, you haven't been paying attention.
<|endoftext|>I saw the gleam of a new Era get demolished by the need for wealth. I'm starting to think humans are incapable of peace. We might have a small portion of the population that is able to see how things can be better but a whole lot of people are drenched in the kool-aid, those born into old money and those that have succeeded with the help of already successful people. It's in us on a Fundamental level. 
<|endoftext|>Organized religion is the biggest tool of mental and spiritual enslavement in the history of mankind. It's a problem, not a solution.
<|endoftext|>&#x200B;AnCap vs AnCom vs Anarchy - Constructive in action 1000 Anarchists land on a verdant desert island. 1/3 want anarchocapitalism, 1/3 want anarchy with limited personal property, and 1/3 want a purely anarchic system. If you go to an Anarchy group, you will see that these three subgroups definitely exist, and they almost never agree on some major points. What, then, to do? The first and most pernicious problem is how to divide political control over the land. The best way to divide the land is clever, but simple. We will divide control over the land randomly among all one thousand Anarchists. Every man, woman and child gets a share, but this will result in some people "lucking out" and getting shoreline or high ground, and some unlucky people getting land in the swamp. In order to statistically even out the utility of all the land, we divide the land into 100-10,000 times as many parcels as there are people. Each person will get \~1000 different claims to random pieces of land. Every person will have 100 pieces of prime land, 800 pieces of average land, and 100 pieces of crappy swamp. Land can be traded and leased for up to 100 years at a time, so people and groups can trade to consolidate areas to serve as commons, town centers, or other large utility districts, but only for 100 years, at which time all leases must be renegotiated. Title falls to next of kin, evenly divided in the same random fashion (but with a smaller number of splits or no splits). Payment for leases must be paid in a way that is amortized over the length of the contract. In this way, you cannot bring a person into the world without some claim to a piece of the Earth they inhabit. Similarly, if you have TONS of kids, they will enter this land with a smaller share than you had, so it provides an economic pressure to control population, naturally. For pre-existing land with existing owners, land is divided in the same way, but the current owners get an automatic free lease for 25 years, and they can negotiate a 100 year lease with the new perpetual owners. Land is the toughest part, and there are other ways to do this, but the manner here outlined is superior to all other mechanisms I have chanced on. Next, groups declare their guiding principles, and accept members. Everything is voluntary, and you can live on the island without being a member of any group. If you have no group, then any disputes will be arbitrated customarily, depending on the customs/rules/norms of the person you have a dispute with. The anarchist will have a group similar to this: There are no rules. The guiding principle is voluntarism. Personal property is respected with regard to natural law and the voluntary principle. You can contract with people. You can do what you want on your own property. Arbitrate disputes as you see fit.The AnCaps will have something similar, but they will add a few things: 1. All defense and enforcement is funded by a single, simple 5% tax, which you are required to pay (like a consumption tax). 2. All expenditures from taxed funds are required to have the support of 80%+ of the payers of the tax. If you pay twice as much, you have twice as much say. If you pay no tax, you have no say. 3. All disputes are arbitrated by a double blind, random arbitration. 80% of the judgment jury must agree, without deliberation, to impose any remedy.  4. If called for jury duty, you must attend or you are penalized. 5. If you pollute, you have to pay the required effluent charge. 6. Any person may utilize our dispute arbitration process once per year for free, whether or not they are members of the group. 7. No member may have sex with a minor of more than three years age difference. 8. All enforcers are chosen by lottery for a one year term. No person can serve for two consecutive years. All interactions are recorded and are available to the parties interacted with. All enforcement happens in pairs, with pairs determined randomly for one week periods.9-25. Other small laws, concerning excessive noise, pets, biological engineering, excessive weapons stockpiling, nuclear energy and freedom of travel. The AnComs will have similar rules, but in joining, you give a lease to your personal property to the group for the duration of your membership. Constructive additionally has the rule: If you violate a rule in a group, you are allowed to appeal any punishment by the group to the general population. If the population finds that the activity does not warrant punishment, the worst the group can do is expulsion from the group and exile from included property. Groups can make agreements with each other (treaties), and can be inclusive or exclusive at the whim of the members. TLDR, Constructive is a system by which you can choose the parameters of cooperation among people. It does not prescribe Anarchy or any flavor of Anarchy. It allows San Francisco to try a full communist system, while Sacramento embraces a direct democracy, with Texas operating as a republic, and it lays out the rules for interoperation between these groups. It allows "guess and check" in the purest form, and does not predict what will be successful. If San Francisco succeeds, Communism will spread. When it fails, it will start to resemble a more decentralized system with private property (with limits, because San Francisco). Over time, it will result in 10,000 distinct systems with a means for them to peacefully interact. This is LONG, but it is MUCH shorter than the book I wrote on the matter, if anyone is interested. The system is as simple as possible, but no simpler. It can work in Iran, Israel, the Congo or Hawaii. Every aspect of this system is volutary. If anything involuntary is added, it is by the express will of a BIG majority of the participants. It recommends against simple majority rule (strongly) and representatives by election (strongly). It embraces approval voting, range approval voting, and proportional approval voting. It allows scored and ranked voting, and recommends against plurality voting. It is a set of questions that members must answer to form a cogent system, but it says nothing about what answers must be embraced. It always has a parachute clause to call a meeting to reconsider the whole system or parts of it. It can resolve the issue of whether abortion is murder for a particular population, while allowing a different population to select a different answer. I strongly believe I know the right answer for this issue, so I believe that over time, 90% of us will come down on the right side of this choice. Fin
<|endoftext|>Congrats. You just got more than forty thousand worthless slips of paper that have enslaved humanity since 1913. 
<|endoftext|>Here's your problem, and our (the 'good' people) salvation. The majority of people are 'good willed'. Meaning that the majority of people (~ 70.5% - 85% of the American populace), according to a statement made by [Andrew Cuomo]( are not 'criminals'. I would suggest that 'criminals' are people that violate the NAP for gain or out of negligence. The Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249.4 million. That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record.As the article concludes, 29.5% is an extremely biased number. Are all crimes people are charged with really crimes? And of these crimes committed, how many are fake, or inaccurate? I would argue that most people, 85%, are 'good' natured people that are not inclined to want to harm others.I believe that the majority of people on this planet will aline with the Non-aggression Principle, once they are made aware of the idea of self ownership. The Non-aggression Principle is incompatible with the existence of an assassination market. Those that agree with the NAP have the legal and moral right to intervene with use of force, if they know it to exist. If the 'good' people find it, you're the target... And we way out number you. It's the natural checks and balances of society. Those type of systems will rise, and we'll knock em the fuck down.
<|endoftext|>But what if your species really is better at moral growth than any other asset? Would the materially unsuccessful strategy of kindness linked to self-sacrifice be the most advanced weapon to use to preserve material existence in this or any related reality?
<|endoftext|>Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Might be that it's a bit too technical for most, it is a bit detailed, and people just gloss over.I gave you an upvote. Don't really have a directed comment other than this... I mean, I am working on a project of my own.What kind of help do you need? Your rocket ship looks massive! How can I be of assistance?
<|endoftext|>I read your ideas with intent, and I definitely believe you are on a good path of thinking. This is the kind of stuff the elite DO NOT WANT US DOING OR EVEN CONCEIVING OF. Keep. It. Up. I believe if you wanted to make this happen for yourself- you may want to consider making an app that illustrates the vision in a simple and engaging manner, then you could allow people to sign in through the app, create forums about the topics; slowly crowdfunding the ideas- recruit small teams to build the proof of concept in select cities. Eventually, it could grow into a company/community/hub for events, infrastructure and eventually entire towns rendered by open-source technology, crowdfunding and engineering. Id love to help any way that I can! I have an extensive background in marketing/social media video advertising, and I am currently obtaining my degree in electrical engineering. Send me a pm to chat! 
<|endoftext|> I have some small acquaintance with computer programmers. Dont do it.XD Wouldnt taking the financial system away from people who know double entry bookkeeping and giving that power to people who know computer theory cause a relatively large group to be replaced by a relatively smaller group (based on the relatively simpler math involved)?This is why open-source is so vitally important. As society evolves, more people will join the ranks in knowledge. The 'good' out number the bad, and I believe the natural checks and balances of society will prevail. There's no putting that genie back into the bottle.
<|endoftext|>I see your point. But this is a public safety issue. For the worst cases, we're talking people who have murdered not one person, not two, not 10 or 20, not 100, not 1000, not 10,000, but *hundreds of thousands of people.* MILLIONS, in some cases. Why? For money and power.If we gave em life in prison, they could bribe their way out. For sure. Then we have monsters on the loose again. Sorry, but there's only one way to solve this.
<|endoftext|>I think maybe they just mean a justice system that isn't already bought and paid for by the very people who would've been prosecuted already if in fact there was a true justice system
<|endoftext|>Plenty of sociopaths become very capable doctors and lawyers. Sociopathy is not necessarily a problem, providing it is well controlled.
<|endoftext|> Children have tons of empathyNo they don't. Children are the true representation of our base desires and actions, not constrained by the rules and regulations of a modern society because they don't know about them yet. They'll form cliques and put down anybody that doesn't fit their little world view. I'm pretty sure getting bullied for the color of my skin wasn't because the system "beat it out of them". It's because it's human nature, and you can't legislate against it.
<|endoftext|>It's not just political power that they seek. They become CEOs, they join the military, they become police officers, they become teachers, they become medical practitioners... Any position in which a person can have power over other living beings is going to be a target for them.
<|endoftext|>Here's a post I made about a Manly P Hall lecture that talk's about this: 
<|endoftext|>There are several proposals in this thread that are capable of ending poverty as a matter of economics. That is, we can produce enough for everyone to have plenty. Then it just becomes a matter of getting rid of the oligarchy seeking to maintain disparities of wealth with no basis in merit.
<|endoftext|>Poverty is easy to eradicate with money. Want to help poor people? Give them money so they're less poor! It's an easy and economically sound idea.
<|endoftext|>Why do you think *some* foreign aid is advisable or necessary and if state and corporate charity was made illegal what portion of your income would you devote to these causes and why?I am just curious and I want to test my supposition.
<|endoftext|>So read, listen and better yourself so you're fit for such a task. Politely talk about philosophy and other deep ideas with people you know. There are so many options for broadening one's knowledge nowadays. You can't control other people or world events but you can control what you do and how people around you feel. 
<|endoftext|>It doesn't take perfection, it just takes respect and caring.Some years ago I was more or less regarded as a "child whisperer" in my extended family, able to get children to obey in situations where they were notoriously "difficult". My secret? I treated them like people.
<|endoftext|>Yes, I agree and generally use the words that way, but was quickly trying to express it in a way people would understand. Probably should have taken longer to think and write this. 
<|endoftext|>As per generating money from energy....Would you understand the importance of u/5dreality's proposal better if you replaced 'money' with 'value'? Generating more value from more energy...?A higher energy throughput economy is a must if we want to make the world a better place.
<|endoftext|>Money is only a medium of exchange. But energy exists, and is a commodity with real value. If you increase your supply of energy, you increase the total wealth of your nation.Putting the energy to use can create more tangible wealth. Think of burning petroleum in a tractor to harvest food from a field. You're turning a source of energy into food (in an indirect sense).Nuclear power and fusion will also reduce the [volume of fuel]( needed to do work. This is no small accomplishment, as the ages of humanity's progress can be measured by their harnessing progressively more advanced forms of energyDraft animals pulling plows freed enough labor for cities to form.Steam power enabled large quantities of goods to be carried more quickly than horses could pull them.The steam age enabled development of liquid fuels, which enabled many people to have a personal transportation system (car) capable of going carrying them at least 100 times faster than their legs, and enabled us to send rockets into space.Just imagine what we could do with nuclear rockets, cars powered by mini thorium reactors, and so on.
<|endoftext|>That'd be better than what we have now. But better still to have healthy bodies. Generally speaking, we can do this ourselves.
<|endoftext|> You're trying to use the system to beat the system. Even IF you win... It's still THE SYSTEM. You haven't changed shit. That's like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.You aren't going to suddenly change the system. Violence begets violence. There's no magic bullet that will solve all the woes we face- hard work, organization, that is the only thing that will save us. If you still think you can vote yourself free, you haven't been paying attention.You yourself are buying into the lie. The vote was the great concession of the Elite's. The one thing they gave the Plebs, in full belief that they could manipulate the masses and even the vote. But the greatest flaw is mass action and organization- they can only stuff ballots so much. Through grassroots organization real change can happen.Everything else is just feel good words and platitudes while the Elite's still maintain power and we talk and talk and talk, accomplishing nothing. Why do you think they panic when we Primary them? Why do you think they try to hide the Precinct meeting dates? Not because voting is irrelevant, but because voting is *dangerous* to them when done in an organized fashion.
<|endoftext|>"All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but [they shared everything they had.]( With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And Gods grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need."
<|endoftext|>I believe technology must become more human and less digital if it is to help the many instead of the few, but isnt that possibility precluded by blockchain? Its an extremely inelegant solution to the problem of knowing.
<|endoftext|> Blockchain as it is , is simply not the answer.Which is why people are working at making it better. Blockchain tech has been around for almost a decade and it is still in comparative infancy. It was not a perfect-formed solution when it was created, and it is not perfect now. However, as it grows and develops, it will become more of a solution to the problems of establishing trust relationships independent of government (thereby making the institution of government both redundant and unnecessary).
<|endoftext|>Blockchain is just another step in the grand Agenda of the Central Banks. If people really think that this form of currency can be truly *decentralized* I think those people are delusional.
<|endoftext|>Regardless you shouldn't go back and prosecute people for things you're just now making illegal, which is what they said.
<|endoftext|>You're both partially right. Some kids have excellent empathy, some kids are absolute nightmares. Barring any disorders, this difference is pretty much exclusively the result of their upbringing. The little shits learn to be awful from their parents, and then society rewards that behavior by making it easier to get ahead through stepping on others, further reinforcing it. The empathetic children are the ones getting stepped on, so they learn to put up a barrier around themselves and stop being so open-hearted.
<|endoftext|> No they don't. Children are the true representation of our base desires and actions, not constrained by the rules and regulations of a modern society because they don't know about them yet. They'll form cliques and put down anybody that doesn't fit their little world view. I'm pretty sure getting bullied for the color of my skin wasn't because the system "beat it out of them". It's because it's human nature, and you can't legislate against it.You think there's no empathy within their little cliques? Children develop contextual empathy because that is a necessary skill in our society.
<|endoftext|>The reverse is also true. The sensation of power *produces sociopathic behavior* in otherwise-normal people.
<|endoftext|>People's ability to truly imagine themselves in the position of others is way below what it should be.Says who, and how do you quantify what it should be? I'd say that today the average person has more empathy for others than ever before. I believe this is due in part to the advent of the internet. In previous generations, people were only really concerned about their neighbors, family, and friends. Basically, their immediate surroundings. This was due to their lack of access to knowledge about other people half a world away. Today, that knowledge is at their fingertips.People ignore the plight of others not because they lack empathy. They ignore it because it hurts. Empathy has a physical response, and seeing people suffer is not a pleasant feeling. Caught up in their own lives, trials, and tribulations most people choose to ignore what they can't control and focus on what they can.The problem stems from people not believing that their action, alone, can change anything. It's the ole, "What can I do? I'm just one person." 
<|endoftext|>There always will be someone at the lowest.Sure more reseources would mean the minimum standard of living would go up.But people would still be poor.If you rank a grade of 50 students. There is always a lowest rank.Sure the entire class may have scored 95%+.
<|endoftext|>Except that doesn't really work in practice.For example, approximately 70% of lottery winners go broke in a few years, according to[ National Endowment for Financial Education]( About 70 percent of people who suddenly receive a windfall of cash will lose it within a few years.Giving people money is not a solution to poverty. Teaching people to be responsible with the money they have, and allowing people to keep their money (extinction of compulsory taxation) is a way better solution.
<|endoftext|>Effective foreign aid should lower the number of migrants clamoring to enter wealthier nations, where they usually only exacerbate local poverty and crime. It's cost-inefficient to just keep sending them back where they came from, so the ideal thing is to help them improve their situation at home enough that they no longer feel the need to leave. It's a win/win so long as the aid offered is actually effective.How much I'd be willing to devote depends on the type of aid in question, but a combination of local and foreign aid could get a good 50% out of me if it seemed properly efficient.
<|endoftext|>Nice,The best way to do it would be to some form of capped and audited public funding for campaigning. I would gladly give up a little bit extra from my pay packet if it meant political donations by individuals or businesses were now illegal.In the US you have a stuffed system I've seen figures where it cost Obama ~$1.04 billion to win, and Romney $994 million to lose. I just can't see where the money goes (apart from the trough), but that means there are a lot of favours that need cashing in...
<|endoftext|>His post is all about producing energy and selling it.... How bout, energy just becomes a basic need for all of humanity?
<|endoftext|>Money is only a medium of exchange I agree with that... What I don't agree with is selling the energy. Energy should be viewed as a basic human right, it comes from our home afterall. Wether it be gas, electricity, thorium, whatever, money is not what brings any of that into existence. There is 2 things I would like to see in our future, the first is a Universal Basic Income, and the second would be a Universal Basic Living.UBL would = food, power, shelter and education. This is how we end poverty and suffering worldwide.
<|endoftext|> Through grassroots organization real change can happen.You're absolutely correct, and in my opinion, you should build that rocket ship! Meaning, work on your solution and build it to the greatest height you can achieve. I personally believe it's foolish and fruitless, but who the fuck am I?I wish you well in your venture, it seems like a lot of work. Meanwhile, I'll be ignoring all that BS and build my solution (rocket ship). It's always good to have a plan B.Basically, there's no one way towards freedom. It's going to take all of us doing what we can to free ourselves. If you feel that you have to jump through all those ~~hopes~~ hoops (Freudian slip) to declare yourself free, have at it.I already know I own myself, and that's enough for me.
<|endoftext|> But how does an intervention through application of force morally align itself with a principle of non-aggression ?The [NAP]( In contrast to pacifism, does not forbid forceful defense. If you violate the NAP, force is justified. Assassinations violate the NAP, pretty simple.The rest are all great questions no one has the answers to. Guess we gotta give a try to find out.
<|endoftext|>Your proposed future echoes previous attempts in recent history to throw off an elite few hierarchs by the many who hunger for more. It often turns mean. The centre cannot hold.
<|endoftext|> but isnt that possibility precluded by blockchain?I wouldn't say the possibility is precluded at all by blockchain tech. In fact, I think it's a precursor to a Decentralized Autonomous Digital Organism. Think of it, millions of computers working together to weave an intricate pattern to be used as independent personalities. If processing power is the bottleneck today. It won't be in 20 years.Blockchain tech has just learned to craw, give it some time to mature. 
<|endoftext|>Its not. It will always be controlled by the rich.Be it the government. Or rich "independent" entities who "donate" the most processing power.
<|endoftext|>Exactly.Banks will buy crypto out if it ever becomes relevant.Why destroy something if you can control it for your own needs
<|endoftext|>/u/WindCanBlowMe gets it. That is exactly my reasoning./u/Griff_Steeltower explain to me how redistribution of wealth to pay for free housing, food, and energy is, as you put it, "pointlessly vengeful"? Pollution is already illegal. There is a vast amount of proof they just get away with it. Banking criminals walk free openly admitting to the crimes. Im not making up new laws and cherry picking people. These extravagant psychopaths have to much wealth and no moral understanding of the power that comes with that wealth. Im not advocating violence ~~or even to lock them up.~~ The rest of us need some of that wealth to save the human race and eventually all life on Earth and this solar system.-edit I am advocating to lock them up
<|endoftext|>You are defining *poor*, differently than how it should be. The issue is, poverty as defined, means inferior in quality *or* insufficient amount of. They should not be mutually exclusive. There are many ways we can use technology to end insufficiencies in the world. 
<|endoftext|> Teaching people to be responsible with the money they have, and allowing people to keep their money (extinction of compulsory taxation) is a way better solution.And if people literally have no money? In Haiti hundreds of thousands of people lost *everything*. They're not going to benefit from money management classes and a tax holiday. They need food, water, shelter, and enough dignity and hope to carry on. Also I think its offensive to suggest, for instance, that a mother with a flattened home and three hungry children can't figure out on her own how best to manage her resources. There seems to be a really paternalistic attitude in the west regarding poor people--as though the reason they're poor is because they're ignorant or stupid, and not for the real reasons like failed domestic political systems, interference from foreign governments, predatory multinationals etc. etc. 
<|endoftext|>If the last compartment contains people with enough food, clean water, shelter, and medical care to live long, healthy lives, then who gives a shit?There's always going to be people that are poor relative to others, but it doesn't mean their lives need be brutal, nasty, and short.
<|endoftext|> It's cost-inefficient to just keep sending them back where they came fromYou can solve this fairly quickly by retracting our troops from losing wars and deploying them to protect our borders from invasion. I think this is also a solution to:Effective foreign aid should lower the number of migrants clamoring to enter wealthier nations, where they usually only exacerbate local poverty and crime.You don't have to let them in.How much I'd be willing to devote depends on the type of aid in question, but a combination of local and foreign aid could get a good 50% out of me if it seemed properly efficient.I have a different value system I think. I don't believe a single dime produced by my labor should be given in foreign aid whether through my tax dollars or my own volition until everyone I share my country with has the best possible quality of life.Further, I would say that it should be a localized hierarchy of recipients. I will not give to the city until my neighbors are cared for, nor my state until my city is cared for, etc.I think this is the way to a better world. 
<|endoftext|>There was a study by the conservative / libertarian Cato Institute that said corporate welfare was costing each American taxpayer around $6000 a year. Rather that go to candidates and get rid of the crony capitalism. 
<|endoftext|>I've explained the best way to dramatically increase the supply of energy on earth, which is the best way to create the surplus needed for the universal basic income you desire.
<|endoftext|>Poverty and suffering is a much more complicated issue than Money as a medium of exchange. One of the biggest factors in poverty/suffering is the "Overton Window". Its a mirage of what a certain person or groups of people want you to see. Usually a small picture.You need a way to pay for UBL and UBI. With a Space Elevator alone, you could use the surplus wealth to give every citizen 5k-50k a year UBI. You need to be careful of money is bad meme. The way our country prints money now is bad, moving to a fiat currency would solve alot of problems of quantitative easing that exists now with printing
<|endoftext|>That's by the new, false chronology. By the true chronology it won't end for another ~300 years. I believe in 2309, or close thereabouts.
<|endoftext|> I already know I own myself, and that's enough for me.What you speak of here is a different sense of ownership. I am no slave, and I live my life in a way that I feel expresses that belief. However, I feel that if we are to make a better world, where *all* are free, then we must follow the steps I outlined- as far as this country is concerned.However, you are not wrong in working alternate paths- the one I highlight is just one among many. I wish you the best of luck on your own journey, fellow traveler. Stay safe out there. 
<|endoftext|>Watch the state shut it down. The evil state is perpetual, they will enslave every last person until everyone is a guilty prisoner. The Federal Reserve will consume anything in its path. Blockchain only provides an example of this, so I do support it, but be prepared to be hunted down. 
<|endoftext|>False. It is already beyond the ability of governments to control.It is not the miners who control Bitcoin Developers are also major stakeholders with controlling interests. So are users. There are at least three major controlling interests in Bitcoin, and if any of them fuck it up there are plenty of viable alternatives.
<|endoftext|>No I'm saying this was Their plan for a long time. With modern computing technology, rigging an economy has never been easier.

Can't talk about Facebook, I don't use it, but I'm sure most people care there too.There are assholes all over the world, and at every point of human history. Assholes are typically louder than most, but that doesn't mean there is a majority of them. Or, even a very large minority of them. It just means assholes are ... assholes. They tend to scream, rant, and rage about things. That's what makes them assholes. They stick out to you because, you guessed it, they say dumbass, asshole-ish shit, and you remember it. Most people, like 99% of humans, feel empathy to some degree. Only about 1% of society has sociopathy. 
<|endoftext|> paternalistic attitude in the west regarding poor people--as though the reason they're poor is because they're ignorant or stupid, and not for the real reasons like failed domestic political systems, interference from foreign governments, predatory multinationals etc. etc. I completely understand that people/countries/ethnicities are being exploited and poverty is being forced upon them. It's being forced upon them by governments. This I completely understand, which brings me back to taxation.My solution was not just about education. Which is not a 1st or 3rd world issue... ignorance of the financial/monetary system is global. The second part of my solution plays a MASSIVE role in remedying the issues you've brought up.If people are left to self organize and spend their money, and most importantly time, on what they choose, anything is possible. Taxation and government fuels the exploitation of the impoverished. Don't get so caught up on semantics. Education on how to manage money simply keeps you abundant. The primary barrier to wealth on this planet is government (taxation).

<|endoftext|>I find it fascinating how all conspiracy theories are basically subsets of one major conspiracy. Like this is absolutely true - if you look at institutional investors, the same companies own the industrial farm chemical manufacturers, the CPG companies that make and distribute the highly modified and processed foods, and the pharmaceutical companies to treat the chronic illnesses they cause. And all of those largest stakeholders are banks. Which basically leads us back to the major conspiracy which is that the world is run by a hidden group of banking elites who continuously pit different groups of humans against one another to suppress the realization of our true potential as a species and rise up. The scientific communitys flaws are just another spoke in the big C Conspiracy wheel.
<|endoftext|>"For many years I have worked with researchers doing very careful work in [parapsychology], including a year that I spent full-time working on a classified project for the United States government, to see if we could use these abilities for intelligence gathering during the Cold War. At the end of that project I wrote a report for Congress, stating what I still think is true. The data in support of precognition and possibly other related phenomena are quite strong statistically, and would be widely accepted if it pertained to something more mundane. Yet, most scientists reject the possible reality of these abilities without ever looking at data! And on the other extreme, there are true believers who base their beliefs solely on anecdotes and personal experience. I have asked the debunkers if there is any amount of data that would convince them, and they generally have responded by saying, probably not. I ask them what original research they have read, and they mostly admit that they havent read any. Now there is a definition of pseudo-sciencebasing conclusions on belief, rather than data! When I have given talks on this topic to audiences of statisticians, I show lots of data. Then I ask the audience, which would be more convincing to youlots more data, or one strong personal experience? Almost without fail, the response is one strong personal experience. I think people are justifiably skeptical, because most people think that these abilities contradict what we know about science. They dont, but that's the subject for a different talk!"-Jessica Utts, President of the American Statistical Association in 2016
<|endoftext|>I don't have much to add but I read a great post in /r/technology that highlighted how scientific papers get shoved behind a paywall whenever they're published in a scientific journal, having most of the money go to the journal editors while they pick and choose what gets the most publicity. This is essentially gatekeeping real advancements in science in the name of bullshit politics.  Then also there's the fact that loads of scientific studies publish conclusions to non-reproducible experiments, leading people to false conclusions about things, and often these "predetermined" studies are funded by particular corporate interests (for example: studies funded by Monsanto that say glyphosate in roundup is safe and not a cancer risk).

<|endoftext|>Oh man, I have a full broadside to unleash at the scientific establishment here. Science is fucked. And I know that sounds ignorant but you really have to look deeper into what science as an institution has become. It's no longer about using evidence to either prove or refute theories based on the validity of the premises like High-Priest Sagan would always preach, it's about financial influence, the defence of dogmatic ideals, and information gatekeeping.Currently in modern society, especially on communities like reddit, science is sacrosanct. People will refer to science as the be-all-end-all to an intellectual discussion/argument. Which in theory should be perfectly valid, but that's not the reality of the situation. The reality is that science has become twisted by interest groups, science journalism has descended into the realms of entertainment journalism and headline grabbing, and the university system long ago became a business. The problem with everyone's cry to science as an authority to how the cosmos works is that they no longer have a deeper understanding of the concepts they are being told about and just take the conclusions of science on blind faith, assuming that they are being told the truth. The tragically ironic part of this is that this is the exact attitude people have had to religion for centuries, something that would immediately set off the cognitive dissidence alarm in the minds of most 'rational' people. But unfortunately that's what it has become, science has taken on the ideals and attitudes of a religion, while ironically lambasting those very same ideals.But hey, I did say I had a full broadside of shit to unleash against science here so let's get to some sources. The first thing I want to strike at is science journals, the new bible for some of you. So many people cry to see proof in a respected peer reviewed journal as concrete evidence that a particular concept or theory is valid, but what if those sources are not legitimate. What if the integrity of the peer reviewed journal system long ago became compromised? [This post here]( has about a dozen links to respected sources which state that the peer review system has become corrupt and that false findings, skewed and cherry picked results, and straight up fraud are running rampant in scientific journals. But don't take my word for it, listen to former editors of respected publications flat out stating that *It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published"*. [See here]( [and here]( You want more sources? Check [this post]( and go down to the section on science. The whole system is cracked. And how about the influence of financial interests? Well there are sources [here]( [also here]( that explain how companies such as Monsanto have entire departments whose job it is to either discredit research or skew studies. I won't even bother trying to find sources talking about the energy industry warping the perception of climate change and sciences because they are almost too numerous!! It doesn't end there, how about the very core of what our belief structures as a society are based on? What about sacred theories such as evolution? Which [hundreds of scientists]( no longer feel is valid in explaining the origins of life on earth. Or how about history, where the established idea of how civilisation has formed is no longer accurate based on geological evidence, studies such as [this]( which call into question the ancient history of mankind we are all told is true. Not to mention the work by men such as Graham Hancock and Robert Duval. If you want books you can read works such as *Worlds in Collision* by Immanuel Velikovsky and *Cataclysm: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C* by D S Allan and J B Delair, which will completely change the way you think about ancient history. All results of a scientific establishment that has become dogmatic and rigid in what they will allow to be changed about established beliefs. This is just the tip of the iceberg. If you start digging you can find an enormous amount of testimonials from academics about how universities decide what they can and can't study, how fields like anthropology and astronomy will ruin the careers of those who go against the established belief structure. Fuck, if you really want to see evidence of how the university system is just a business you can look no further then the amount of student debt currently held by not only Americans but young people all around the world. University is a business, not a learning institution. What we believe about the world, the cosmos and ourselves is nothing more than lies and dogmatic beliefs that are no longer relevant or valid. We believe the lies of modern medicine and pharmaceuticals despite the constant stream of whistleblowers trying to scream at everyone not to believe them. We have an ideal about what we are as a species and where we have been as a civilisation that is wrong, flat out wrong. And yet it's how we live our lives and how we define ourselves as beings. It's so much bigger then just a few skewed research results, it's the ideals we base our whole lives and society around. If that well of knowledge has been poisoned then what is the ramifications for all of us if we continue to drink from it? 
<|endoftext|>I'm aware this isn't all of you (just a seeming majority), but can you please stop conflating evolution, evolution by natural selection, abiogenesis, and possibly the big bang theory under the umbrella term of "evolution"?If you really want a science conspiracy, maybe start with figuring out why a substantial portion of the population doesn't understand the difference between those terms; it's the biggest example of active disinformation in science in my opinion. It's easy to dismiss "evolution" when it's presented as, "basically everything is random and came out of an explosion and also god doesn't exist", but evolution is the simple fact that species change over time (observably, this isn't disputable unless you are an absolute moron). It isn't anything else. Natural selection is the concept that evolution can be directed by natural forces; if a change is detrimental to the reproduction of an organism, it tends to get passed on less than ones that are beneficial, thus over successive generations the beneficial traits tend to stick around while the detrimental ones tend to get weeded out. It isn't anything relating to abiogenesis, or the big bang, or even any specific claim about heritage. This is literally how we breed animals and plants, so it shouldn't be controversial either. If you want to dispute abiogenesis, or say that a specific claim about heritage is false, or even go for the absolute bullshit that is intelligent design (an idea that assumes the conclusion and sets out to find any way of supporting it that isn't immediately disprovable, only to fail literally every time), go right ahead, but please for the love of all that is good stop talking about the "myth of evolution"; each time you do, you are simply proving that humans are, in fact, dumb apes, and by virtue of failing to correctly use even the most basic terms of something you're making a claim to have insight on beyond that of the general population, you are ensuring that anyone with even a cursory understanding of the topic dismisses any and all claims you make immediately. 
<|endoftext|>I have something to add to this. Some of you may know me from my " what the hell happened in x " posts, which I will be updating soon enough.You may know that I do not find the Mainstream Scientific Community to be of much merit, while I do value their contributions to society. I especially find the Mainstream historical, biological and archaeological communities to be extraordinarily spiteful.I have gathered some examples of discoveries which could have overturned what are considered accepted facts, that were bitterly scorned, with their discoverers spurned by the global scientific elite. -In the early 1950s, [Thomas E. Lee]( of the National Museum of Canada found advanced stone tools in glacial deposits at [Sheguiandah]( on Manitoulin Island in northern Lake Huron. Geologist [John Sanford of Wayne State University]( argued that the oldest Sheguiandah tools were [at least 65,000 years old and might be as much as 125,000 years old]( For those adhering to standard views on North American prehistory, such ages were unacceptable. Humans supposedly first entered North America from Siberia about 12,000 years ago. Thomas E. Lee [complained]( "The site's discoverer [Lee] was hounded from his Civil Service position into prolonged unemployment; publication outlets were cut off; the evidence was misrepresented by several prominent authors . . .; the tons of artifacts vanished into storage bins of the National Museum of Canada; for refusing to fire the discoverer, the Director of the National Museum, who had proposed having a monograph on the site published, was himself fired and driven into exile; official positions of prestige and power were exercised in an effort to gain control over just six Sheguiandah specimens that had not gone under cover; and the site has been turned into a tourist resort. . . . Sheguiandah would have forced embarrassing admissions that the Brahmins did not know everything. It would have forced the rewriting of almost every book in the business. It had to be killed. It was killed. -In 1880, [J. D. Whitney, the state geologist of California]( published a lengthy review of advanced stone tools found in California gold mines. The implements, including spear points and stone mortars and pestles, were found deep in mine shafts, underneath thick, undisturbed layers of lava, in formations ranging from 9 million to over 55 million years old. W. H. Holmes of the Smithsonian Institution, one of the most vocal critics of California finds, [wrote: "Perhaps if Professor Whitney had fully appreciated the story of human evolution as it is understood today, he would have hesitated to announce the conclusions formulated [that humans existed in very ancient times in North America], notwithstanding the imposing array of testimony with which he was confronted." In other words, if the facts do not agree with the favored theory, then such facts, even an imposing array of them, must be discarded.]( sad thing is, Whitney was involved in his own cover ups, imploring that the Yosemite Valley had shrunk as opposed to being carved out by glaciers, and was posting redacted studied long afyer it was proven-Anton Mifsud, a noted archeologist who I have written about before, covers the Malta cover up, [including the deliberat destruction of wall carvings, wall paintings, skulls and fossils and acientific reports brilliantly here]( de Quatrefages, a member of the French Academy of Sciences and a professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, wrote in his book Hommes Fossiles et Hommes Sauvages (1884): "The objections made to the existence of humans in the Pliocene and Miocene periods seem to habitually be more related to theoretical considerations than to direct observation. He wrote this in relation to the findings of another scientist, a J. Desnoyers at St.Prest, which had been dismissed despie ardent evidence.-Another recent example of challenging discoveries contradictive to the the views of the MSSC by dismissing them as false or fabrication, similar in fashion to that of the St. Prest discovery is the events surrounding the [bone fragments discovered by George Miller, curator of the [Imperial Valley College Museum in El Centro, California]( Miller, who died in 1989, reported that six mammoth bones excavated from the Anza-Borrego Desert bear scratches of the kind produced by stone tools. Uranium isotope dating carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey indicated that the bones are at least 300,000 years old, and paleo-magnetic dating and volcanic ash samples indicated an age of some 750,000 years. One established scholar said that Miller's claim is "as reasonable as the Loch Ness Monster or a living mammoth in Siberia," while Miller countered that "these people don't want to see man here because their careers would go down the drain. -A good example of a controversial American early stone-tool industry reminiscent of the European eoliths is the one discovered by [George Carter in the 1950s at the Texas Street excavation in San Diego.]( At this site, Carter claimed to have found hearths and crude stone tools at levels corresponding to the last interglacial period, some 80,000-90,000 years ago. Critics scoffed at these claims, referring to Carter's alleged tools as products of nature, or "cartifacts," and Carter was later publicly defamed in a Harvard course on "Fantastic Archeology." However, Carter gave clear criteria for distinguishing between his tools and naturally broken rocks, and lithic experts such as [John Witthoft]( haD endorsed his claims. In 1973, Carter conducted more extensive excavations at Texas Street and invited numerous archeologists to come and view the site firsthand. Almost none responded. Carter stated: "San Diego State University adamantly refused to look at work in its own backyard." In 1960, an editor of Science, the journal of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, asked Carter to submit an article about early humans in America. Carter did so, but when the editor sent the article out to two scholars for review, they rejected it. Upon being informed of this by the editor, Carter replied in a letter, dated February 2, 1960: "I must assume now that you had no idea of the intensity of feeling that reigns in the field. It is nearly hopeless to try to convey some idea of the status of the field of Early Man in America at the moment. But just for fun: I have a correspondent whose name I cannot use, for though he thinks that I am right, he could lose his job for saying so. I have another anonymous correspondent who as a graduate student found evidence that would tend to prove me right. He and his fellow student buried the evidence. They were certain that to bring it in would cost them their chance for their Ph.D.s. At a meeting, a young professional approached me to say, 'I hope you really pour it on them. I would say it if I dared, but it would cost me my job.' At another meeting, a young man sidled up to say, 'In dig x they found core tools like yours at the bottom but just didn't publish them.'" The inhibiting effect of negative propaganda on the evaluation of Carter's discoveries is described by archeologist Brian Reeves, who wrote with his coauthors in 1986: "Were actual artifacts uncovered at Texas Street, and is the site really Last Interglacial in age? . . . Because of the weight of critical 'evidence' presented by established archaeologists, the senior author [Reeves], like most other archaeologists, accepted the position of the skeptics uncritically, dismissing the sites and the objects as natural phenomena." But when he took the trouble to look at the evidence himself, Reeves changed his mind. He concluded that the objects were clearly tools of human manufacture and that the Texas Street site was as old as Carter had claimed.The point I wish to make here is how Carter was treated.Later dating proved him somewhat wrong and his critics somewhat right in that they were both off, its was older than what was accepted, but younger than what was claimed.

<|endoftext|>we shouldn't forget that reddit is also contrived.everything we read everywhere, too.theres nothing like gathering your own evidence if you can
<|endoftext|>The problem that I have with science in the western world is that "science" is no longer about classification of knowledge and the activity of of breaking things down to understand them. Science has become the subjugation of truth and reality- and that is just... it really has taken a toll on people's minds I think, in the Western world.A lot of people equate science to truth. They think that science is about finding truth but it's not. You learn about the science *of* something.I think that science has pushed magics and things not easily explained or understood (including- but not limited to- concepts of a God, fixed or multiple realities, etc.) into something that seems "silly" or "archaic," and because of that I find myself shocked at the Western world and how everyone in it gets played like a fool and then wonders why.Those"elites" or "powerful people" or the "1%" or whoever else- **they believe in magic and practice it. They believe in the occult and they regularly practice it.** Why? You think because it's a fun activity? Because they're just "oh so evil" so they need to reflect images of that? No. Because the shit is real. And they're using magicks and occult practices on you people. Lemme just drop something here so you guys understand. "Magic"- from where I'm from- is seen as- the manipulation of reality, and people back in the day- back in our homeland- practiced witchcraft heavily. I have family who practiced witchcraft (Obeah). So when you start to manipulate reality- which we know is a construct of our minds (conscious and subconscious)- is when you start to perform magic.Telling a lie is the most normal thing here in the West, meanwhile- you would be exposed and branded elsewhere for something like that. You even have people out here talking about "white lies." And no one questions why? Nobody asks why there's "white lies" and "black/dark magic"? That they needed to differentiate to begin with??Imagine a world where people told the truth and lying was almost as bad as murder, imagine how straightfoward and honest people would be and how much trouble that would save you. Places like that exist. I've lived in places like that. My home country is like that.Science is great. But to me science is research- science is the constructions of a thing. You learn about the science of biology. The science of chemistry. The science of psychology. You don't learn the science of truth- because the truth is the truth- period. Let me end this with: "magic is magic until its science" is false. It's only through understanding the science of something that you can then perform magic.
<|endoftext|>I would argue the biggest issue is the mis-connect of the public's perception of science and actual science. I find most pop-science articles to be crap, which often miss the point of the original paper or greatly expand the original conclusion beyond what the original paper was getting at. These funds often go to this considered "sexy" for the moment, so if you aren't doing "sexy" and "inpactful' research, good luck. This issue also comes from the public mis-understanding of science, since answering or exploring a question isn't seen as being important. To be a modern scientist, you need to be able to respond to the frequent questions of "what's the point?", "how will this impact my life?", among others. Another thing to consider is that big claims need lots of evidence to support the claim. A scientist will change their mind if you can show enough evidence to back your claim. One issue I have with claims of engines using water (for example), is that the builders of these engines usual are secretive about what happens in their engines, they ask for money first before showing the engine, and don't back up their claims with evidence. If you want be to believe you, show me things to support it. Otherwise, I don't care. You can say whatever you want, but if you don't back it up, I don't need to believe you. I don't think an individual will ever be blacklisted for these claims, but they won't be taken seriously if they continue to fail to support their claims.A third point to be aware of is that most science is done as a public service. Scientists PAY to publish and do peer reviews for FREE. Also, scientists are humans, so there are some biases and people with big egos in the mix. However, for the most part scientists will try to keep their biases and egos in check.And from my experience, the more I understand the world scientifically, the more in awe of it I become. I can look into an empty lot and be awed by the life growing and living there. I have seen that in death there is life. I have seen that for every question answered ten more arise. If you think we have discovered everything and no mysteries remain, your mind is already closed.

<|endoftext|>I'm always amazed by the level of anti-intellectual resistance and hysteria that my videos receive on YouTube, largely from people that share this perspective of science and automatically distrust and resent anyone who possess scientific knowledge and skill. At this point I don't really care about educating them, I just enjoy owning them in debates and making them look like fools. The hysteria over this month's double SDO eclipse (due to retrograde motion caused by SDO's orbit) and the resistance many had to its explanation has illuminated a great way forward for me. I've set up a YouTube bot that will automatically predict all future SDO eclipses. &#x200B;[ of course this bot does not get many subscribers or views, but that's fine with me. When the next eclipse happens that causes the anti-intellectuals to start blaming Nibiru, Planet X, Hercolubus, or whatever else, I'll be there and ready with a video predicting it that has an upload date that pre-dates the event. I will then enjoy the fights and argumentative beat downs that occur as we discuss how I'm a shill, paid by NASA, a secret government agent, a liar, etc. And so the myth of "scientism" will continue and I will contribute to it.
<|endoftext|>Most of the "scientific" literature for which we base our medical decisions is bullshit. Favorable data gets published, unfavorable data does not.This presentation really opened my eyes to how the whole scientific literature system works. Everyone says "don't listen to one study, look at the whole. Look at meta- analyses." And while I still usually agree with that, there is a whole other part we need to look at.Industries flood the literature with an overwhelming number of studies, meta-analyses use the same data in a duplicate manner and don't realize it, using ghost writers is the norm even if they're from a pharmaceutical company, unfavorable data just doesn't make it to publication, etc.
<|endoftext|>I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had. Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period. **Michael Crichton** 
<|endoftext|>I prefer the term "scientism" and it is not only the corporate $ interests that hijack proper science it is the non-thinking cult followers that blindly salute anything published by left wing, PC approved scientists. Climate change, vaccines, medicine, evolution, psychology, etc. are examples of topics where the scientism adherents claim "the science is settled". 
<|endoftext|>We are in a metaphysical crisis. The previous sign regimes of the west, specifically Christianity embodied in the image of Christ, have been washed away and replaced with new symbols. The emblem of the cross has been superseded by flashing electric images of advertisers and Hollywood showman.We are witnessing the dawning of a new religious order following the Nietzschean "death of god". The metaphysical crisis of our age was born well over one hundred years ago. We could place the pin at many events but these things happen in stages.The electric age as it evolved brought about both the death of god, and the dawning of a new faith. The scientist of today has much in common with the priest of the past. Similar vestments even. Religion always dawns out of who has the answers to critical questions about the movement of the stars. The first astrologers who could calculate a eclipse secured the power of that guild of star gazers for millennia. Today our scientists grapple with the same questions that priests and shamans grappled with. What is life? How is it formed? And how did the world come to be? When understood it this way the theories that attempt to define the world around us, specifically evolution and the big Bang Theory are nothing more than modern day creation myths. The flaws in the data of both theories are well known to the average scientist. In the big bang a failure to account for the possibility of a infinite universe leaves the realm of "empty space" beyond what our current telescopes can detect. Hense the recent claim of "multiple big bangs" to reconcile the time space differential. And to the theory of evolution betting on chance and lightning to form the first rna structures or preorganisms. To get around this they begin to use the claim that a meteor with some bacteria on it seeded life on earth. .It is easy to understand why science has become a "cult" when understood from a perspective of how the masses view people with critical information about the movement of the stars. Science didn't choose to become the new religion. The masses forced them into that role.
<|endoftext|>There is a question about the fundamental nature of reality that was glossed over early on and needs to be re-examined; is the basic substrata of the universe matter or thought? Physicalism or idealism? The scientific method can only ever address empirical questions. The (useful and necessary) requirements of observability and measurability, restrict the perview of scientific inquiry to physical phenomena. This does not mean that there only exists physical phenomena, simply that ideal or non physical phenomena are outside the realm of questions science can answer. I think now is a pertinent time to start asking this question again. From the rise of AI, Mandela effect and simulation theories to a potential awakening of consciousness through psychadelics, many fields of investigation are opening up the possibility that we've erroneously assumed a purely physical and mechanical universe, to the exclusion of any potential form of idealism. I am not saying that the universe is ideal. I am saying that when we deify 'Science' with a capital 'S' and pretend that the only answer to every question must be scientific, we shut off a space for questioning which is counter-productive in the open pursuit of knowledge in good faith. *edit* original post was miles too long and rambling, the last two paragraphs were my end point. 
<|endoftext|>In science we believe everything has been proven. That is a huge misconception. They can't prove anything. The term theory means just that, a theory. Theory of evolution. Not provenTheory of gravity. Not proven Theory of relativity. Not provenCell theory. Not proven. They are at best a reasonable guess that explains a phenomenon. If we don't even know what molecules or cells are how can we say for sure that climate change is being cause by chemical reactions? Find one thing that science has proven. 
<|endoftext|> today, in all fields, is plagued by corruption. Yet, more often than not, attempts to create awareness about scientific fraud  an issue that few journalists have been willing to address  are met with the response, Well, is it peer-reviewed?Although good science should always be reviewed, using this label as a form of credibility can be dangerous, causing people to dismiss new information and research instantaneously if it doesnt have it, particularly when that information counters long-held beliefs ingrained into human consciousness via mass marketing, education, and more.
<|endoftext|>Every religion needs an end of times scenario. Like heaven and hell or Armageddon. This fear generated creates a system where people are basically buying insurance for their soul. Science is absolutely the NWO religion. They even have Armageddon built in. What do they call that? Global warming or climate change. If you don't do what we say the world will end. Sounds like every other religion to me.

<|endoftext|>Want to see gatekeeping? HI GUYS, ITS THE MORGELLONS GUY. (no I do not give people morgellons, don't hurt me) was removed for no real reason and I classified it under medicine or biology, I forget.**If your lazy, TL;DR:**Submission statement (I will be using the conclusion of the article): "Conclusion"The history of MD has taught us that scientific evidence must be carefully considered before a disease is written off as a purely psychiatric disorder. Delusional disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires clinical judgment, and all underlying causes for delusional symptoms need to be ruled out before jumping to erroneous conclusions. Medical practitioners continue to consider MD a delusional disorder, although studies have shown that MD is strongly associated with spirochetal infection. According to the best-available scientific evidence, MD should be considered a dermopathy associated with tick-borne disease. Further study of the genetics, pathogenesis, and treatment of MD is warranted."Morgellons disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi present within the epidermis, Borrelia burgdorferi, the same bacteria that causes Lyme disease, is the culprit. The presence of the borrelia spirochetes causes keratinocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes to activate causing filaments of keratin and collagen with pigmentation occurring to form on a microscopic level.**BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER** I swear someone edited and changed my comment to sound grammatically and verbally incorrect, go read what I copied and pasted (and had to edit?) on the original thread, it reads like someone edited it to sound... idk?**Going on**Where did my hunt begin? 2016 at the start of the new year.Why did you hunt? Came across a youtube video of some jacknugget with hair taped to a lamp shade with the light on with the hair moving saying how the hairs are alive/etc, was kind of fucked up but I had remembered it back in the day being the "delusional/bug disorder", and from 2013-2016 my understanding of biochem, etc just got better (self taught, no certificates or degrees, I suck) at reading peer reviewed articles and determining garbage method/something, etc etc. Something about that video, at that time sparked a sudden desire to research it, and then I came across something sexy in my opinion, it turned me on sexually and mentally. THE ORIGINAL STUDY:  folks, its one of the sexiest peer reviewed studies I have ever layed eyes on, it legit gave me a hard one. "In BDD, keratinocytes have been shown to activate cytokine production and influence inflammatory markers.8 Morgellons patients also demonstrate inflammatory markers that indicate cytokine release.""In chronic BDD infection, there is evidence that spirochetes damage keratinocytes, resulting in the formation of unusual keratin fibers.15,16 Spirochetes have been shown to activate cytokines and other inflammatory markers.86 Keratinocytes influence inflammatory cell movement and retention in the epidermis via cytokine release.87,88 Tissue damage is aggravated by neutrophil infiltration, inflammatory mediators, and cytokines.15,16 Epidermal proliferation, hyperplasia, and influx of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes result in damage to keratinocytes and production of abnormal keratin filaments. The production of keratinolytic toxins by treponemes has been proposed8 and B. burgdorferi has been shown to stimulate inflammatory chemokine secretion."This got me thinking, if bovine digital dermatitis is caused by a spirochetal infection, and theoretically, based upon this peer reviewed article, is also the cause of Morgellons, wouldn't keratin like filaments and cytokine release in the skin cause itching/bug feeling? Wouldn't it feel like microscopic needles of keratin and collagen (Yes, fibroblasts are being activated) inbetween/inside cells/in your skin?This got me digging. Most of my end research comes here:  was 100% manufactured unintentionally, for all those wanting to ask this question, I name the bacteria that causes it, it was released ACCIDENTALLY AND UNKNOWINGLY, and happened to be quite the little mutator/evolver. None of that matters now, AT ALL, what matters is stopping it, figuring out how to fuck its shit. First comment, is in regards to Morgellons, there are many more comments to come folks, c:**EDIT: Want to point out the reason I was pretending to get all sexual with this study, was because I forgot to mention that Lyme disease is considered a Spirochaetae, which means it can be sexually transmitted, theoretically, morgellons can be sexually transmitted as well as its causative agent is the same bacteria that causes Lyme disease. 
<|endoftext|>THE SECOND COMMENT IS HERE FOLKS, AND THIS ONE IS WAY FACKING DIFFERENT.ACROLEIN FOLKS, your probably thinking "What the fuck is this guy going on about, what is this chemical, google tells me its nothing important, its fuck all, why you talking about some random fucking chemical dude on reddit?"The reason I am talking about this chemical today is because glycerol is added to cigarettes, do you know what happens when glycerol dehydrates, and also when plant matter improperly combusts? It creates acrolein, acrolein hates humans, it fucking hates us, but its pretty damn silent about its hate, it does its damage in the long run. When you smoke a cigarette there is added glycerol, that added glycerol breaks down into acrolein, that acrolein then bonds with an adduct bond to your glutathione, which is the main antioxidant of the body, and is pretty helpful for preventing cellular aging. But it gets worse, acrolein, hates humans soo much, that when it comes contact with glutathione, it turns glutathione against humans, the adduct bond creates glutathionylpropionaldehyde, this also depletes the glutathione, I will give an example:Acrolein fucking hates humans, meets glutathione, it loves humans, but acrolein fucks glutathione and gets stuck in glutathione creating a whole new human hating fucking monster through DBZ fusion. Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.Before I go any further, I have to explain what Acrolein does exactly, want to find out? ""The biological effects of acrolein are a consequence of its reactivity towards biological nucleophiles such as guanine in DNA and cysteine, lysine, histidine, and arginine residues in critical regions of nuclear factors, proteases, and other proteins. Acrolein adduction disrupts the function of these biomacromolecules which may result in mutations, altered gene transcription, and modulation of apoptosis." Which is from [here]( leads to cancers, and organ failures, and likely some fucked up diseases, but this is just acrolein...Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.It fucking hates us even more. So Acrolein also has the ability to create ROS or free radicals, which are bad, and numerous, but what is really bad, is when acrolein FUCKS THE SHIT out of glutathione and once again DBZ fuses into the hate monster of hell. But then comes along Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.[So the following information is from this peer reviewed article]( fact that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a more potent stimulator of oxygen radical formation than acrolein indicates that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a toxic metabolite of acrolein and may be responsible for some of the in vivo toxicity of acrolein.""Anyone know what an anti-oxidant is?, it donates electrons to free radicals, to you know, calm them the FUCK DOWN, like little fucking hyper Caillou's everywhere. Everyone fucking HATES THOSE CANCER CAUSING FUCKERS. Anyway, glutathione is an antioxidant, the most important antioxidant, not just your regular vitamin C, glutathione is that antioxidant king, its like, the Don of the antioxidants. This is also a true statement, but other antioxidants will actually work better in the presence of this antioxidant, its just that fucking good (Not really, most antioxidants are actually meant to be taken together, like think of a tomato, you got lycopene, vitamin C, and vitamin A, and thats all I can think of, those are all considered antioxidants, and eating 2 tomatoes will actually have more antioxidant effect vs avoiding antioxidants and taking a 400mg or whatever vitamin C chewable. Basically, smoking is very bad, the addition of glycerol in cigarettes accelerates the negative effects. The negative in-depth effects are caused by acrolein depleting glutathione in the body producing glutathionylpropionaldehyde and creating more ROS/free radicals (damaging hyper fuckers who want to be fed some electrons, think hyper over-active Caillous).
<|endoftext|>Third, this one is a little less sciency and a bit more theoretical and fun discussion.So this is just a random comment, I don't have many peer reviewed articles on these topics, but I am sure if you dug, you would find something. Some are also theoretical, and some have also been tested and had secondary issues preventing them being used sufficiently. I am going to talk about cancer cures. Now with the new immunotherapy they have out, there really is no excuse not to perfect cancer prevention and reverse cancer growth. But 2-3 years ago, this comment would have been all the rage.EMF generator. During mitosis, little spindles come forward to pull the parents duplicate chromosomes apart to pull one set of the duplicate pair to the daughter cell, so well, you know, replicate, and as long as they both get one full half of the chromosomes, they can repair the other side, and continue splitting/growing, like a tumor, or you know, like your butthole or something. Their is a polarity that occurs during this time, and using a generator that creates a small EMF field during growth stages (lets say they know how to "stimulate" or cause the tumor/cancer to "grow/etc"), which would cause the duplicate chromosomes to not split correctly, causing the daughter cell to go into apoptosis basically immediately, and following that, apoptosis occurs in the parent cell, leading to a reduction in the original size of a tumor. This has been used before on some Swedish Bicyclist or something. Monoclonal antibodies. As per google: "Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Monoclonal antibodies can have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody)."What this means is that it can directly target cancers with radioactive isotopes or with cancer medication. Now, this one is sketchy, but its called sodium dichloroacetate. It is known to cause mitochondria within tumors to awaken, the mitochondria immediately recognize the cell is compromised and they go into apoptosis (cell death), leading to a cell/a part of the cancer/tumor, being destroyed. Now, on my fourth comment, I will get into explaining how marijuana/THC has been proven to cure some forms of cancer, specifically glioma cells. Look out for the fourth comment folks. 
<|endoftext|>HEY KID, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM? HOW MANY FUCKWITS HAVE TRIED TO TELL YOU RANDOM SHIT? DO YOU REMEMBER THOSE MYLELIN SHEATH'S THAT COVER YOUR NERVES, PROTECTING THEM? REMEMEBER THOSE FUCKING PHOSPHOLIPID BILAYERS AND SHIT FROM HIGH SCHOOL? Well apparently their not just structural, we found out that there is basically a secondary fatty acid signalling system, and that is what the endocannabinoid system is, yuh. (As per google/wikipedia on endocannabinoid system: The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and cognitive processes including fertility,[1] pregnancy,[2] during pre- and postnatal development,[3] appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory) these data strongly suggest for the first time that activation of the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway may play a pivotal role in the oxLDL-induced SMC proliferation and atherogenesis. " ceramide accumulation in tumor cells mediates cannabinoid-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies. This effect seems to be due to the impact of ceramide on key cell signalling systems such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade and the Akt pathway." enzyme is regulated by several mechanisms, including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated protein FAN (for factor associated with N-SMase activation) and oxidative stress. " the main active component of marijuana, induces apoptosis of transformed neural cells in culture."" intratumoral administration of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 induced a considerable regression of malignant gliomas in Wistar rats and in mice deficient in recombination activating gene 2. Cannabinoid treatment did not produce any substantial neurotoxic effect in the conditions used. ""Experiments with two subclones of C6 glioma cells in culture showed that cannabinoids signal apoptosis by a pathway involving cannabinoid receptors, sustained ceramide accumulation and Raf1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation."**TL;DR: THC or CBD oil intake increases ceramide levels, generated by hydrolysis of the membrane sphingophospholipid sphingomyelin (SM) through the action of a sphingomyelinase, and the increase ceramide levels control programmed cell death, and much more that we are still learning.**
<|endoftext|>This is my fifth comment and its in regards to the nature of the thread.In regards to this threads direction, science is not flawed, its that corporate interests sway outcomes, especially when a dozen researchers realize its either lie and get an extra 500k to live for a few years and add more research under your belt, or tell the truth, have the corporation back away from that research group, they lose funding, now people have to move, etc, some may have to go back to other countries if they can't find work in a reasonable time, etc. This is the sad state of society, not of science itself. I am a big theorist, I will sit here and tell you I believe we are all Yahweh, an enlightened/higher frequency being lowered his frequency to come and aide us, we corrupted them, and now I believe everyone is in limbo and no one has true power. I can also tell you there is no god and we are inside a black hole, the event horizon of a black hole holds all the information/data, it is always gathering, if specific data hasn't been received yet/something hasn't been sucked in yet that is not present within the event horizon, theoretically, that thing is impossible until it collects the necessary information, outside our black hole is another universe, with another event horizon, and you can imagine it infinitely, like a cell dividing, and gathering the necessary resources to mature or some shit. I can also theorize we are all electromagnetic beings who are being reincarnated repeatedly by frequency vampires who lack souls, but possess the ability to persist through another means beyond light, which theoretically, our souls are said to be comprised of. I can add to my first crazy theory and say reincarnation is a process of preservation, if the soul doesn't ascend, they are reincarnated and once again given the chance to do what they are supposed to do/their mission/whatever. When it comes to science though, its there, its just it requires thorough navigating and anyone who has their body in the room has to follow the rules or they are removed, me being an outsider peering in through multiple windows, one outside the room in the hallway, and one with a view in the room, basically, if it is their bread and butter, it is necessary to make sacrifices in order to survive in certain circumstances, either literally by putting food in your mouth or academically by submitting papers and continuing research to show off and try to get more research funds/etc. *I have no hate when I say this, its a true generalization*People are smarter, they can process things faster this day and age, but people lack understanding multiple concepts/sciences, so I can read through papers pertaining to diseases, biology, biochem, and I can verify if its a good paper(In my opinion, based upon method, setup, depth of study, if its been cited by a newer study, if it refers to good, older studies, etc), but you give me physics papers and I won't be able to tell you SHIT. Its not that people are dumb.The biggest problem that will be presented in this thread will be corporate interests, I dotted in other things that will likely be ignored, as well as my four other comments. EDIT: Problems that will be outlined in this thread: Corporate interests and its persisting effects, necessity staying relevant within academia, lack of understanding of multiple topics, or ignorance. 
<|endoftext|>Business interests have always compromised just about any innovation. Either in an attempt to maintain an older technology or to hold fast and monopolize another etc. That is unchanged for a long time as given example by Vespasian and Titus deciding to not accept a steam engine because it would upset the slave trade.the peer review system used for gatekeeping is a little harder to get to, but the absence of peer review is quite apparent and that can support gatekeeping for certain. There simply is not a lot of peer review that goes on because of the sheer amount of research being done.Incorrect premises are corrected all the time through the scientific method. Galileo was doing it too.I think there are a greater amount of people who simply cannot grasp the basics of a given science and so, in their ignorance they adopt a suspicious attitude. God forbid they should actually recognize their own ignorance and try to overcome it. Funny thing how ego works and the more ignorant a person is and combined with age, the less likely you are to explain much of anything. The ignorance is so deeply ingrained it becomes hopeless. There is a lot of this going on. As populations grow, there will be even more, because the heart of it seems to be that no matter the change, it stays the same as there are particular dictates of our own human nature that we cannot by that very same nature break free of.
<|endoftext|>The virtues of true science are conflated for the hyper-compartmentalized, infinitely specialized, and prohibitively costly endeavor currently called "Science" and then promoted and held high in society, schools, culture as the former.

In-fact, all the laws of physics are completely wrong - period!As an example, to say a body in motion will remain in motion until acted upon by an external force, this is wrong! I can not breakdown the dynamics of the Universe without literally writing a book, but I will tell you very simply that; If there is something preventing Matter/Energy from moving faster than the speed of light, then that something is going to have an effect on all Matter/Energy in the Universe!To keep things simple, say you are in the Void - you are between the Galaxies. Okay, you are there with a bow and arrow - you pull back the string and shoot your arrow in the direction of the nearest Galaxy, it is 5 million light years away, and there is NOTHING between you and that Galaxy. - Will your Arrow continue moving at the same speed and direction towards the Galaxy? Mainstream science will say it will. even if it is on its journey for billions of years, it will continue on its path until acted upon by a force This is FALSIFIED! If there is something that prevents matter or energy from moving faster than light, then that something will have an effect on all matter in the Universe and this something will have an effect on the arrow. It will travel at the same speed for a very very very very very very long time, but eventually it will start to slow down. The Higgs Field (also known as the Dark Energy Field, the very field that gives Matter its Mass will slow the arrow downEnergy cannot be created or destroyed is also inaccurate.I will keep it VERY simple and tell you that there are ways to use Time Manipulation and generate an excess of energy - NEW ENERGY can be created, and I will tell you that Black Holes are creating NEW ENERGY all the time.The Universe will not shrivel into nothingness. Stars are not giant balls of gas, Black Holes arent simply points of infinity sitting in space doing nothing but eating Galaxies! Black Holes, especially Supermassive Black Holes GROW Galaxies!Black Holes are actually Crystal Core Quantum Computers and they literally create Universes inside themselves and if the Universe inside the Black Hole is growing, the Black Hole can actually generate an excess of energy and spit that excess energy up and grow a Galaxy around itself!
<|endoftext|>I use to think this was crazy. Recently I have become interested in Plato and his political theories. I think these theories have formed the foundation for western political science. In one of Plato's books, called The Republic, he suggests that the reproduction of the cities population be controlled by the ruling elite. Since the population would rebel against such control, Plato suggests using a lottery where two people would be chosen at "random" to have sex. Of course the rulers would be making the choices.The city he is describing is not a republic. The people think its a republic, but it is really an oligarchy.I think with the increase in communication, and the increased access to education, people are starting to see that **modern day republics are oligarchies also**.

<|endoftext|>Imagine having just finished your medicine degree, getting a job at some hospital, work 70 hours a week, just to hear this quote. 
<|endoftext|>Evolution was never about explaining the origin of life, teachers and professors always teach students to refrain from using concrete words like "fact" and "proof" when describing scientific evidence, and the rest of that article was pretty much crap.
<|endoftext|>Skepticism of any institution is valid, and none are perfect. That said, just because science is flawed as you succinctly point out doesn't mean its all invalid or useless. 
<|endoftext|>My honest question to this is its great that we have all this knowledge, but we can we as individuals do about it? I would love to make a difference if possible but dont even know where to start. I feel like being informed isnt enough if Im only one in a handful of people that knows the truth whatever that may be. 
<|endoftext|>Goddamn exactly! And its pretty crazy as to HOW wrong we've gotten it... In terms of evolution, theres now strong evidence for directed panspermia causing the cambrian explosion (I can gladly point you to the source). So if you consider that, it would mean that theres been something watching for a while, what does that mean for evolution? What if you can tweak evolution by changing what viruses fall on earth?That's just the tip of the iceberg, the problem is these ideas used to be able to be considered by the community, now with blind faith anything that fundamentally challenges is met with a veracity and emotional response that causes productive discussion to be impossible. Many do it with good intentions, to prevent "wrong" thoughts to be accepted by the public. Problem is if you're unwilling to consider anything different you will forever be stuck with the understanding you have. This isnt only true of biology and evolution, but also physics, psychiatry, etc, many fields find themselves in a place where the leaders are so deeply entrenched in faith they become enraged and unable to listen, it's really rough trying to go beyond this response.
<|endoftext|>Science is fucked compared to what? Trusting government, religions? Seriously its the best tool we have.
<|endoftext|>Just because you can use pretty language doesn't mean you understand the elements you speak of.Natural selection and intelligent design are not mutually exclusive, this is a false dilemma.You're the one intentionally conflating concepts, and then drawing lines in the sand where they dont exist and then claiming, ha, because I can define that line in the sand it means everyone else who cant is wrong and has not spent time thinking about the problem.If you want to talk about virtue signaling... yes now everyone knows how smart you think you are...
<|endoftext|>PART 2-Danny Hilman Natawidjaja [was not able to carry out excavations of the suspected pyramid of Gunung Padang, because senior archaeologists from Indonesia were lobbying the government in Jakarta to prevent him from doing any further work on it]( on the grounds that they  know the site is less than three thousand years old and see no justification for disturbing it. After the presidential intervention in 2014, Danny was able to excavate, and in the expected time to reach the deeper layers, proved that a pyramid did indeed exist under the original site of Gunung padang, as well as buried structures and chamber. More importantly, very ancient dates for all of the above, The three chambers discovered are so rectilinear in form that they are most unlikely to be natural. The largest of these lies at a depth of between 21.3 and 27.4 meters (70 to 90 feet) and measures approximately 5.5 meters (18 feet) high, 13.7 meters (45 feet) long and 9.1 meters (30 feet) wide -In 1923, J Harlan Bretz proposed that the scablands, as well as the Grand coulee, Moses Coulee and the Quincy basin, were all formed as a result of one gigantic flood erupting from the melting of the  spokane flood  which was referred to as such due to the town of Spokane, and the iceberg was referred to as the spokane iceberg, although it is today known as a part of the much larger Cordilleran ice sheets. The reaction of the geological establishment was one of stunned, embarrassed silence. To have strayed so far from the doctrine of uniformitarianism could only mean that Bretz must have gone mad. David Alt, Professor Emeritus of Geology at the University of Montana, describes one of the lectures that Bretz gave in which he expounded on the ideas in his 1923 paper:  The geologists  were aghast in the same way that a roomful of physicists would be upon hearing a colleague explain how he had made a perpetual motion machine out of old popsicle sticks. Alt describes an old professor of his own undergraduate days who had been a student sitting in the audience when Bretz read his 1923 paper. It seems the professor did a hilarious impersonation of Bretz pounding on the podium with both fists and stomping on the floor as he used vivid language and gestures to convey his idea of a catastrophic flood to his horrified audience. Quite apart from the theatricals, the geologists were shocked to hear Bretz invoke: "a sudden catastrophe to explain the Scablands of eastern Washington. In their view, this was a reversion to the unscientific thinking of some 125 years before. To this day, most geologists consider it nothing less than heresy to invoke a catastrophic explanation for a geologic event. So Bretz stepped off the edge of a very long limb when he suggested that a great flood had eroded the Scablands  [It made] him a pariah among geologists, an outcast from the politer precincts of society". The outcast did not give up, however. On the contrary, he doggedly continued with his research, bringing down ever more controversy on his head in the process but believing that facts, ultimately, would vindicate him. The crunch came on January 12, 1927 when Bretz was ambushed by a lynch mob of his colleagues at a lecture hed been invited to give to the Geological Society of Washington in the Cosmos Club, Washington DC. He believed that large parts of the spokane iceberg " must have melted with extraordinary rapidity, because the volume of water was very great, almost incredibly great  In spite of high gradients to draw it off, the pre-existing valleys first entered were inadequate to carry it all, and the flood spread widely in a complicated group of anastomosing routes.-Bretz was not an exception. Alfred Wegener, who first proposed the notion of continental drift plate tectonicswas similarly pilloried, as, subsequently, were Luis and Walter Alvarez (the Chicxulub, K-T impact), Steven J. Gould (punctuated equilibrium), Victor Clube and Bill Napier (coherent catastrophism), and James Lovelock, Sherwood Rowland, Mario Molina and Lynn Margulis for their contributions to geophysiology and the Gaia theory. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that Richard Firestone, Allen West, James Kennett and others who have followed the evidence and stuck their necks out to suggest that a comet impact caused the Younger Dryas haD also come under sustained and bitter attack.

<|endoftext|>Yes. But if all of the scientific study and evaluation for Product A comes from the manufacturer and the federal agency that's supposed to regulate it--and those agency's directors are previous board members of said manufacturer....Who is going to fund and investigate the claims?
<|endoftext|>One thing that I've bumped into is that there are things that many Scientists as they're currently taught are simply unable to consider. If certain fundamental "truths" are questioned the mode of thinking instantly switches to emotional and irrationally skeptical, at that point many scientists will use a skill many have, being able to cherry pick something small to validate what you believe and wash away the rest.One example I've been using to bring this out is a spinning bicycle wheel on a pole, when you spin it up and move it around it feels heavier right? Could this same effect explain isotopes in the way of electrons spinning up instead of adding neutrons? How come E=mc^2 doesn't have a velocity term? Many many quantum physicists literally become enraged, as if your insulting a religion than trying to figure out what's going on... it's insane.Unfortunately I think this guttural reaction has been leveraged to prevent any huge fundamental leaps in progress, limiting all progress to incremental small steps
<|endoftext|>If someone could post some examples of toxic incentives derailing worthwhile findings, it would really drive this point home.
<|endoftext|>So this will be a discussion where we can simply make grand and sweeping allegations without providing any evidence at all?
<|endoftext|>I think its important to make a distinction between the current embodiment of Science and it's institutions and scientists working within much of it.I think vast majority of the scientists working in this system actually really really want to do good, they want to make real progress happen. But the incentives are toxic, and those who fulfill them rise up in the chain while those who stick up for their morals are reprimanded as such.The human will is there, its a matter of bringing it out. We currently don't understand how powerful we are, but that the time for that to change is coming. Not in any like woo woo we can learn to fly with our brains sort of thing, but in the way that once we understand the underlying structure of our universe the power to imagine and bring thought to reality takes a whole new meaning.Computers can't imagine, and our system does not incentivize imagination in any way shape or form, part of the toxic system that currently is in place. But people want to imagine, we just need to bring it out.
<|endoftext|> Almost each and every peer reviewed study in the community has edited data to conform to a predetermined hypothesis to keep the funding rolling in.Can you explain what you mean by this? Peer review is specifically important so different programs under different funding can confirm or debunk a study. Peer study is exactly the process used to eliminate "edited data to conform to a predetermined hypothesis." 
<|endoftext|>You nailed it. I am heavy into anthropology/archaeology and the like... anyone who steps out of line in this field and reports findings that don't fit a narrow view has their "careers" ruined in an instant and are mocked... even if they are coming from a completely "scientific" place with hard facts and well thought out theories. In the long run so many of these forward thinkers have been proven right. It's the same in any field that relies on funding from corporations, universities, etc... all highly political atmospheres where truth doesn't really matter. The status quo does because it's obviously working damn well for them.So yeah... never underestimate what a person will do when their meal ticket or fragile ego is at stake.
<|endoftext|>Spot on. The best budding scientist in the country won't succeed if they can't write a good grant application. A negative result used to be a GOOD thing. The science of the next golden age will be open source. 
<|endoftext|>When you are aware of things like this, it makes trying to live within the world almost unbearable. It's like the whole world is rigged to only benefit a select few, and we all just get fucked.People sure can be evil all in the name of money and power.
<|endoftext|>I think the point of science is to explain the world we observe in the using the fewest number of rules. Many people, especially those currently in power, have forgone that driving goal for the prioritization of order over progress. There's no reason to upset the status quo if it continues to maintain order. It's appealing and easy, but often times the simple path is the hard path.But I do say, there are a LOT of very smart, especially young, scientists who want to work outside the bounds of the current rotted system. The question is how do you empower those people? 
<|endoftext|>You start out with very insightful knowledge:In science we believe everything has been proven. That is a huge misconception. They can't prove anything.But you're incorrect to expect anything more than this. Turns out, the only things you can "prove" in the technical sense are to be found in "closed, logical systems" like math and formal logic. Those systems deal with deductive logic: if truth goes into valid arguments, you can guarantee truth as a product.Science, forensics, fraud investigations, applied maths, all the other forms of "figuring things out" or "verifying theories" that exist deal in *inductive* logic.Inductive logic cannot guarantee the truth of the product **even if the inputs are true.** That's why science can't "prove" anything, however, it can *demonstrate* theories. And it's the system of figuring things out that we depend upon the most.For example, if you mix vinegar and baking soda 10,000 times, and each time it does the same thing, you still cannot guarantee the reaction on the 10,001st time. But science can answer one question with certainty: is this theory false? The answers come in 3 varieties: * 1. Yes* 2. Not yet* 3. The theory is meaninglessThat's all we can get from science.To sum up, most people don't understand a goddamned thing about science or evidence, yet they're ready to take a shit on all the products of scientific investigation regardless of methods employed to reach various conclusions. In order to tell if results are being manipulated, one must actually read the study and look for ways for the data to get flubbed. I'd bet my testicles not a single "science denier" has the patience or wherewithall to do that. 
<|endoftext|>Or measles and a new plague but hey- all vaccines are created equal, are perfect the moment somebody even conceptualizes it and its ready to go to every baby in the world.

If you dont get the flu ahot you're a baby killing monster and you will be witch hunted by the ~~cult~~ science fanboys even if you have all other vaccines.
<|endoftext|>I disagree that science requires simplification. What it requires, to fit the existing paradigm of the scientific method, is specificity. Popular understanding of science ultimately results in over-simplification and subsequent misunderstanding, but science itself does not.
<|endoftext|>I think that science tries to explain the observable with the fewest numbers of rules, the "simplest" way. But this doesn't preclude the idea of consciousness and metaphysics etc, it just means we don't really understand it yet from its simplest principles. The issue in science's inability to interpret consciousness from the bottom up comes from a few places i think, including our misinterpretation on the shape of planck's unit and our rudimentary understanding of how the brain processes information. We still don't really understand how overlapping EMF waves, brain waves, produce a conscient being, much less a deeply spiritual one. If one begins to consider consciousness as spinning overlapping EMF waves performing quantum computation using geometry, our definition of "where" they could live might change as well, could spinning EMF waves live in the ionospheres of planets? Could the Schumann resonances fulfill this role?
<|endoftext|>Exactly if it's not empirical it's not science. That's the reason the big bang and evolution are closer to myth than true science
<|endoftext|>especially so when certain "popularizers" like neil degrasse tyson and his ilk decide to speak ex cathedra on matters they simply cannot have any information about. i like science, but science cannot say anything about what might be beyond death or operating outside the confines of our perceptible universe. i understand that believing in other things is not scientific, i wish the scientists would stick to what they know and can prove.the "cult" of science is especially noticeable when one is confronted by someone educated by these popularizers. i was recently told about how information flows along the surface of a blackhole or something by a guy who read something by stephen hawking. 
<|endoftext|>I think theres one cancer cure that none is considering because it's too crazy... essentially I believe that Eukaryotic cells also have their own CRISPR.

<|endoftext|>The hyper compartmentilisation combined with specialization as a response to increasingly complicated theories is both a coping mechanism (cant learn everything) but also gives a convenient scapegoat when you're given something that doesn't jibe with your scientific world view.

<|endoftext|>That is stupid wishful thinking.Granted, it is entirely possible we are in a simulation, *but* that means we are also *part* of the simulation... a successful attempt at developing emergent artificial intelligence.But that isnt any different than religion is it? The exact same ancient thought with modernized names for things. Still means that *a creator* made us and our world for a purpose; what is the real difference between God created the world in his image and a programmer created a simulated reality to generate true artificial intelligence that passed the Turing test?The reason *your take* on it is stupid is because rather than accept that our world being a simulation means nothing of consequence, you craft some Hollywood cliche of an idea that we are real but our world is not which implies that we could escape it. That is just a false hope of and childish thinking; like supposing you could break open a computer and remove a video game character from *its* simulated reality.Edit: of course, this is probably wasted, Scientologist are too brainwashed to drop your grand archon space opera nonsense... without Star Trek and the matrix, you lot wouldnt even have a religion.

You can perform magic spells on both yourself and others and construct your own reality- but you need to first do it in the mind- "as above so below".&#x200B;Everything you see is constructed around the system, and when you start to think about succeeding outside the system and unlocking your potential *outside the system* \- you've already taken a step towards that.&#x200B;The rich and the elite cast spells on our consciousness every day. Through music, media, advertising- its an attack and a tax on our subconscious... in order to make up the group think- to keep that system going, if you follow.&#x200B;Be aware of magic- understand the *true* definition of magic.

<|endoftext|>the simple difference between the movers and shakers and the general mass of people is quite simple.the busy people are busy, they don't pontificate for a year about a subject, they just do. legal or illegal. they don't care so long as profit and not being caught or spotlighted.they succeed or they fail, then they try again. they may be stopped by a competito or cops, legally or otherwise.we still argue about 9/11, that was over and done with sixteen years ago. they moved onto the GWOT, then they moved onto Shock Doctrine and extracting profit from Iraq and elsewhere.we are still arguing about thermite and dancing Israelis. this is why Noam Chomsky says 9/11 doesn't matter (after the fact), its ancient criminal history, it was treason , they got away with it, they 100% own the legal system..

If you believe the history we learned in elementary through high school to be true, then it points to the Napoleonic wars as when the Rothschild family seized control of world central banks. But that's kind of the point. What we're taught in 'history class' may be completely false. How would anyone know? I mean if someone came up to you tomorrow and said everything you've ever known about world history is false, how could you prove them wrong? It's fascinating to think about.

<|endoftext|>Depends on what your motivation was for getting the degree. Maybe you already knew this and wanting to change it. Maybe the money and prestige will be enough. Maybe you don't believe it at all. What are you imagining?
<|endoftext|>Part of the problem is a disconnect between the realities of science and how it is practiced and regular people who consume information. Scientists deal with evidence but the laity deal with interpretations. Over time those interpretations become cemented as facts with help from educators and the media. 
<|endoftext|>The process is what matters and each person needs to apply the processes and methods to their own decoding of reality. But the results that were told about all need to be taken with serious grains of salt. And that comes from both mainstream science and alternative models. And most importantly, ask yourself Cui Bono? We have to look past what's being said and see the intent of the heart of the person saying it. Only then will we have the right frame of reference with which to view their statements.

<|endoftext|>Honestly man I'm not sure. The best solution I have come up with is to be the change you want to see in the world. One person isn't going to be able to drastically change anything, but as an individual we can contribute to greater change. I almost feel like having to think we personally must be the ones to stop things is just another ego trap. In terms of what we can do about this issue, just talk about it with people. If you talk about these issues, talk about how what we think of science has become something else it contributes to the greater collective conversation between everyone. The more people that talk about it, the more the issue is brought into the spotlight, the more we can begin to work on rectifying what has happened to science as a discipline.

<|endoftext|>PART 3-Early in his career, Louis Leakey, who later became famous for his discoveries at [Olduvai Gorge in Africa]( began to have radical ideas about the antiquity of humans in America. At that time, scientists thought the entry date for the Siberian hunters was no greater than 5,000 years ago. [Leakey recalled]( "Back in 1929-1930 when I was teaching students at the University of Cambridge . . . I began to tell my students that man must have been in the New World at least 15,000 years. I shall never forget when Ales Hrdlicka, that great man from the Smithsonian Institution, happened to be at Cambridge, and he was told by my professor (I was only a student supervisor) that Dr. Leakey was telling students that man must have been in America 15,000 or more years ago. He burst into my roomshe didn't even wait to shake hands." Hrdlicka said, "Leakey, what's this I hear? Are you preaching heresy?" "No, Sir!" said Leakey. Hrdlicka replied, "You are! You are telling students that man was in America 15,000 years ago. What evidence have you?" Leakey answered, "No positive evidence. Purely circumstantial evidence. But wa ith a man from Alaska to Cape Horn, with many different languages and at least two civilizations, it is not possible that he was present only the few thousands of years that you at present allow." Leakey continued to harbor unorthodox views on this matter, and in 1964 he made an effort to collect some definite evidence at the Calico site in the Mojave Desert of California. This site is situated near the shore of now-vanished Pleistocene Lake Manix. Over a period of eighteen years of excavation under the direction of Ruth D. Simpson, 11,400 eolith-like artifacts were recovered from a number of levels. The oldest artifactbearing level has been given an age of 200,000 years by the uranium series method. However, as happened with Texas Street, mainstream archeologists rejected the artifacts discovered at Calico as products of nature, and the Calico site is passed over in silence in popular accounts of archeology. Leakey's biographer Sonia Cole said, "For many colleagues who felt admiration and affection for Louis and his family, the Calico years were an embarrassment and a sadness." Yet the artifacts of Calico also have their defenders, who give elaborate arguments showing that they were human artifacts, not geofacts resulting from natural processes. Phillip Tobias, the well-known associate of Raymond Dart, discoverer of Australopithecus, declared in 1979: "When Dr. Leakey first showed me a small collection of pieces from Calico . . . I was at once convinced that some, though not all, of the small samples showed unequivocal signs of human authorship." Ruth D. Simpson stated in 1986: "It would be difficult for nature to produce many specimens resembling man-made unifacial tools, with completely unidirectional edge retouch done in a uniform, directed manner. The Calico site has yielded many completely unifacial stone tools with uniform edge retouch. These include end scrapers, side scrapers, and gravers." Flake tools with unifacial, unidirectional chipping, like those found at Calico, are typical of the European eoliths. Examples are also found among the Oldowan industries of East Africa. Among the best tools that turned up at Calico was an excellent beaked graver. Bola stones have also been reported. In general, however, the Calico discoveries have met with silence, ridicule, and opposition in the ranks of mainstream paleoanthropology. Ruth Simpson nevertheless stated: "The database for very early man in the New World is growing rapidly, and can no longer simply be ignored, because it does not fit current models of prehistory in the New World. . . . there is a need for flexibility in thinking to assure unbiased peer reviews. Support for the authenticity of the Calico tools has come from a find in Brazil. In 1982, Maria Beltrao found a series of caves with wall paintings in the state of Bahia. In 1985, a trench was cut in the Toca da Esperansa (Cave of Hope), and excavations in 1986 and 1987 yielded crude stone tools associated with Pleistocene mammals. When the bones were tested by the uranium series method, ages in excess of 200,000 years were obtained. The maximum age was 295,000 years. The discovery was reported to the scientific world by Henry de Lumley, a famous French archeologist. The tools were fashioned from quartz pebbles and were somewhat like those from Olduvai Gorge. The nearest source of quartz pebbles is about 10 kilometers from the cave site. De Lumley and his coworkers said in their report: "The evidence seems to indicate that Early Man entered into the American continent much before previously thought." They went on to say: "In light of the discoveries at the Toca da Esperansa, it is much easier to interpret the lithic industry of the Calico site, in the Mojave Desert, near Yermo, San Bernardino County, California, which is dated at between 150,000 and 200,000 years." According to de Lumley and his associates, humans and human ancestors entered the Americas from northern Asia several times during the Pleistocene. The early migrants, who manufactured the tools in the Brazilian cave, were, they said, Homo erectus. While this view is in harmony with the consensus on human evolution, there is no reason why the tools in the Toca da Esperansa could not have been made by anatomically-modern humans. As we have several times mentioned, such tools are still being manufactured by humans in various parts of the world.
<|endoftext|>Well there are a lot of independent sources and have so far reaffirmed most studies.For instance even though sugar is often promoted by coco-cola supported studies , the counter studies proved coco-cola wrong.&#x200B;
<|endoftext|>They become enraged because its nonsense. First off, in e = mc^2, c is the velocity term. Second, the way an electron spins is fundamentally different from a bicycle wheel, they just chose to use the same word. Third, science is all about building models of the world. When your model makes a prediction that matches measurement, you roll with that model until you observe something that doesnt match. If you want to replace neutrons with an up spin, go ahead, but then you have to consider what new predictions that model would make. If you treat it mathematically the same, then it doesnt matter which model you use, nothing changes. If on the other hand your up spin model changes predictions about how particles behave, then you have to check which of the two models match observation better. The current model which includes neutrons matches observations incredibly well, so theres no need to change it. 
<|endoftext|> How come E=mc2 doesn't have a velocity term?That equation is only valid at rest. The full equation from relativity is E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 , where p is the momentum which is related to velocity. When the velocity is zero so is the momentum, and so it reduces to E=mc^2 . I don't think any physicists would be enraged by that question but you could also look up the answer yourself.
<|endoftext|>I think you have a point here. Scientists work very hard and sacrifice being able to live truly free so they can complete their experiments. When someone suggests their entire effort is based on false premises, it causes cognitive dissonance. An easy way to get around the dissonance is to cherry pick an easy argument.A good example is people who work with GMO crops. They will laugh in the lab at how stupid people are for being afraid of GMO crops, citing that transgenic foods have been proven safe to consume. This is cherry picking and missing the entire point. The point that their work with GMO crops is 95% going to propping up a massively unsustainable food system consisting of monocultures and agrigiants.. 
<|endoftext|>Oh quite the contrary; in the process of debunking this nonsense I learn a huge deal. I become better at science by it, and I always follow the evidence no matter how unpopular it makes me. Yes, the end result is a massive intellectual beatdown of the ignorant idiots who chide me for being a scientist. I doubt they learn anything in the end, but that's not my problem.
<|endoftext|>Any large time consuming discovery is put on the back burner for what's instant. That over time leads to a cycle, you start subconsciously prioritizing "safe" ideas.Its hard to give an idea of what might have been, but I think the general state of the field, with huge amounts of complexity and productivity but little creativity points to this type of thinking having been happening for a while
<|endoftext|>People are told how to think in Abrahamic societies. Popular science and overt simplifications of reality for profit is why life in the west is so strange and riddled with problems ranging from poor nutrition to pollution 
<|endoftext|>If we try to make sense of a simplification of reality, the results will be contorted to fit that reality. 
<|endoftext|>You really think so? You believe that millions of scientists and artist and all of NASA and the world are in some huge secret to release the truth to us? Im curious. I work as an intel analyst and work with satlites, space etc.. in curious in your opinion. all respect of course
<|endoftext|>The simple difference between the wise and the naive is quite simple too: there is no "they" or "we" there is only "us" and "ourselves". We are all One and we are all responsible. 
<|endoftext|>Exactly. Anyone who doubts the global banking elite are up to nefarious shit needs to watch the interview with Dutch banker Ronald Bernard. 
<|endoftext|>really? because sales and trading is the only division that faces institutional investors... who the fuck do you think does all of this supposed plotting? has anyone ever in history been as intelligent as they must for this supposed conspiracy to be possible? have inter company relations ever been conducive to this supposed behavior? has a (proven...)conspiracy ever been half as large and as quiet as this? the answer to all of these questions is...no. a simple understand of the financial industry renders most of the claims in your initial post...well...unfounded.
<|endoftext|>sure... controlling interest refers to ownership of a business 50%. creating value refers to financial value (ie earning a return for the bank and providing liquidity to the market)
<|endoftext|>at least for the fed, id argue that private sector banks have more autonomy, greater scope, and have a greater ability to control the public if they so chose. 
<|endoftext|>Perhaps the heart is just a heart. If I show you a head you might know it as Bob or George, but a heart is just an anonymous muscle. It's more of a force than a personality. Maybe you could call it evil. Just a thought.
<|endoftext|>And this this is great. And people that say we live in a society to discredit this dont realize the actual points
<|endoftext|>Maybe the money and prestige will be enoughIf you want to pursue one of the hardest degrees available for money and prestige, you wont finish it. And I say this with personal experience, having talked to med students and myself pursuing it.
<|endoftext|>As in perceiving themselves to be fighting for truth. It's interesting I think, because the same sort of thing I've seen pop up with people who are defending really strong religious truths. I feel like it often comes from a good place, but it can cause you to be too focused and miss stuff.
<|endoftext|>Its a serious question. How do we combine human resources to understand the universe and physical world better? Have everyone reproduce/verify all knowledge for themselves? What a joke and a cop out. Who do YOU trust. At some point your I do my own research answer breaks down into the BS that it is.
<|endoftext|>Okay, so I looked into it on my own, and it appears the talk is not listed on TED.com.That would have been such an easier answer.
<|endoftext|>Go an ask almost anyone studying a particular field how many journal articles they read but also try to replicate. 
<|endoftext|>for how long were coco-cola supported studies considered to be truth before first independent study proved them wrong.
<|endoftext|>This is a Hasty Generalization. You have not studied or provided enough examples for such a conclusion.
<|endoftext|>Exactly, the reason why its a special case is because it considers all of the mass of a particle as a 2D wave, this is only true of 2D things, waves, bosons, photons, 3D matter on the other hand behaves differently, with the analogy of a spinning bicycle wheel becoming relevant. Currently there is no distinction between mass (2D) and matter (3D) which leads to a lot of confusion by interpreting bosons/photons as particles.It coincidentally turns out that electrons kinda are bicycle wheels spinning w/ in the proton/neutron nuclei, most of their "mass" stored in their momentum which is also their negative charge. We perceive the electron's presence in the manner akin to throwing charged tennis ball particles and observing where they land, because of that we see them as clouds. Because vast majority of their energy is "stored" in their clouds treating them as 2D waves in our equations actually proves extremely accurate, but its an equilibrium simplification, in reality these are moving, interacting, objects.
<|endoftext|>That's the current explanation yes, the assumption that the velocity of light does not change, w/ c being a constant. The E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 comes from our misenterpretation of the shape of planck's constant (equilateral triangle vs square triangle), because this is how we currently interpret "square" numbers.
<|endoftext|>Interesting, i'll give these some reading. I'm aware of the work by Marcello Barbieri, personally there are clearly a few codes w/ in biology which show intelligent order, thereby being able to create far more complexity than the sum of their parts. A key concept i've bumped into consistently is that of the generation of controlled complexity through the use of hierarchically organized combinations of building blocks. A few obvious analogies are the transcription factor system that controls our DNA--RNA, signalling cascades involving GPCRs, immune signaling w/ TLRs, etc.There definitely is an intelligent signal [here]( and its interpretation imo makes directed panspermia something to consider.. 
<|endoftext|>Thats like saying you believe millions of soldiers are in on the conspiracy to steal oil from Iraq after 9/11? all respect of course
<|endoftext|>Plato believed in castes, that means he believed that some people were better than others just by the social status into which they were born. I mean " he suggests that the reproduction of the cities population be controlled by the ruling elite" isnt enough to see what a douche he was? And he had socrates to teach him but still....
<|endoftext|>It is metaphorical for a process that is no less insidious, seductive, or captivating than if magic were real and it were indeed a spell.You can get hung up on the nouns, or you can recognize the truth of what is being spoken.Are there lizard people in human skins making the rules? No. But functionally, there are people who are operating on the reptilian brain who are constructing society in such a way that it may as well be true.It is a metaphor.
<|endoftext|>Are you a teenager? Do you want to know an easy way to "cast a spell" to generate money without having to get a job?I will tell you the process (or I could even say- the science) of this spell.First, think about wanting the money to materialize. Imagine the money materializing between your fingertips. What you would spend the money on if you had it. Just think about the money. If you do not do this first step, the money will never materialize.Now that you've found your vibration- we're going to cast a spell by creating an illusion in order to materialize the money.Our illusion will not be grand, it won't take a lot (if any) of physical work, you won't have to make a blood sacrifice- all you have to do is think of a reason you should get this money. Whether it be a road trip, school trip, party, present for a friend or otherwise- let the reason be anything but the truth (which is that you just want to get your hands on some money; and I will tell you why later).Now that you have a reason, fortify it with an emotion. If you don't go on this road trip- will you be sad and disappointed that your friends are going on a life-changing journey without you? Will you be angry if you don't receive the money because it might impact your academic progress (school trip)?Once you're done those three steps- once you've aligned with a vibration (money), you've laid the groundwork for the illusion (the lie) and you've charged it with an energy (emotion), now it is time to cast the spell.All three points must be in a balance of power. The greater amount of money you seek, the greater the groundwork for the illusion must be, and the greater the energy associated with the spell must be.Go to your parents and ask them for money, give your reason, and then utilize your body (eyes, voice, behavior) to display emotion to charge your reason. Remember, everything must be in balance; You cannot make a fuss over five dollars, as you cannot ask for five-thousand haphazardly. Once you've finished asking them- leave all the extra work to the Universe.If your spell worked, your parents should be back with some money. If your spell failed, you should reexamine your spell, or find ways to fortify your illusion in order to materialize the money.To sum this up- through the lie (deceit through symbols spoken), you have created an illusion in the material world (the world of senses), and have began to manipulate reality through vibrations.The breakdown of the casting of the spell to materialization.Something manifesting in your consciousness - Something said by Spoken Language - Something fortified by Energy - Something heard by Your Parents' ears - Something manifesting in their consciousness - Something materializing in realityIf any step is not thought out or fails in execution, the spell's success rate drops significantly. The illusion *must* carry enough power to pass through each step.Our Universe is the truth, the basis of "reality," of order and balance, and your lie is not; because there are always agents of truth (or "karma") seeking to maintain balance and working against your illusion, you will need to utilize other agents (such as emotion- "energy in motion," i.e. desperation, disappointment, sadness, anger) to fortify the power of your lie/spell.If you are very in-tune with your body and connected to your consciousness, you will be able to command your body to behave in a way as if you were telling the truth to add power to the spell. This is why Western society associates "pathological liars" as socially dangerous.However, after all this I must say, if You tell the truth from the beginning- You will not have upset the balance of nature. When the pendulum swings one way- it also swings the other. When we call upon forces to manifest illusions- we're disrupting reality, which rests on Universal Balance (which is a whole other discussion for another day).As soon as you tell a lie and upset the balance- that is the second the Universe starts going in motion to work against it- the more grandeur the lie, the more grand the consequence when the truth becomes realized ("the bigger you are, the harder you fall").If you are wondering the reason why I call lies "illusions"- is because a lie by spoken word is exactly that. An illusion is not materializing "something out of nothing," you are materializing something by utilizing *consciousness.* Our consciousness is connected to our senses. It only takes a split second to deceive someone's eyes. Whether it be by a puff of smoke, or sleight of hand- that split-second of energy and motion, in which the eyes cannot truly see or the ears cannot truly hear- that is the window of opportunity to create new consciousness.You create images of reality in someone else's consciousness to materialize something you couldn't create by yourself. Therefore when I use science to "bend water," or "float while sitting," I'm materializing the power of my 'divinity' or 'supernatural ability' not just in my consciousness- but in *our* consciousness. However, like I said, though chaos energy exists and is everywhere, the universe favors balance.Magic aligned with the truth- the force/balance/nature of the Universe, will always prevail and be more powerful over magic manifested by that chaos which is against the truth, against balance and against nature. This is constant, and it is the way of our universe- it cannot be denied.In our modern age- illusions are powerful ways to cast spells and is the *most common* practice of magic today, in my opinion. One of which is lying, which is heavily accepted in the West, and is even circumstantially dubbed "White Lies," (even though it is still chaos energy). In other places of the world, lying is recognized as a form of chaos energy, or evil, and is not tolerated *at all.*Can you think of ways (other than lying) that illusion spells are cast in modern Western society?Anyway. I don't know why I wrote something this long. Maybe I will create a new thread and leave it there.God bless you and have a good day.
<|endoftext|>i just looked into it. ronald bernard was never a banker. his entire background does not appear credible at all, and it looks like hes an anti semite with strange alt right affiliations. even people that have worked at his foundation have written articles about his strange history and behavior. if you guys want to accept this one strange mans interview prima facie as gospel, be my guest. but elite santanist jews sacrificing children and plotting world domination? im not sure im on board.
<|endoftext|>So by your logic you, and employees like you, can claim personal responsibility for the sub prime mortgage crisis that resulted in billions of taxpayer money being used to bail out irresponsible financial managers. Because hey, you had to be in the know right? You weren't in the dark about these sorts of things so you claim. 
<|endoftext|>This article describes four companies that control the money flowing to businesses without holding a controlling stake.
<|endoftext|>Well you're wrong and the LIBOR scandal proves the entire market is fixed and the FED controls the entire money supply and thus controls all markets. And if you want to be willfully ignorant and not see the big picture that's your prerogative bro.
<|endoftext|>I knew the quote before going in. The money and prestige are not the goals for me.I'm here to help people check out of the system. Come off your meds, use food as medicine, and reclaim your soul.If you look, there are plenty of doctors doing the same.
<|endoftext|>Depends how much you want it and what kind of value you place on those concepts. Regardless what do you think the reaction would be in your scenario you laid out? "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!" ~ Upton Sinclair
<|endoftext|>He sent me a lot of documents via PM to review, but they flew right over my head. I am not knowledgable in the field. They are definitely interesting though.
<|endoftext|>I think you meant ferocity?[veracity](
<|endoftext|>I can see you're trying to engage me but I'm feeling good today so sorry man, no flame war for you. I would suggest that your 'I can't do this so neither can you' attitude might have to change at some point in your life. I don't trust any particular source or institution over another, what I don't do is continue believing something I've found to be either wrong or contradictory purely because it's easier to keep believing it.The way to do this is to start living a completely different society, because whether or not you accept this, humanity is far older then we think it is and we had all this knowledge previously. Humans haven't become super smart over the last 200 years, we've just been hoodwinked into thinking we have. 
<|endoftext|>His speach along with graham Hancock were originally banned from ted. But since they managed get a lot of support from the scientific community and the general public, and his 'banned' ted talk got millions of views from other small channels, they were re-instated.
<|endoftext|>I see what you mean. Sorry if I came off as a little rude in my above post. I am not a particle physicist so I will not try and debate you, but I am involved in scientific research so I will just say that if you want people to listen to you, you can't convince anyone by simply suggesting a conceptual change to the model and saying that it makes more sense. You have to identify a problem that your model solves that can't be solved by the standard model, and then people will pay attention. &#x200B;That's how it was for Einstein and all of the major model changes throughout history. Einstein wasn't just sitting on his couch thinking "hmm what if time is an illusion and it's all relative to each individual observer?" No, physicists were conducting experiments to figure out the speed of light, and they came up with the strange result that it always had the same speed, no matter what speed you're moving at. It's not relative to anything. It's like every observer is standing still, even when they're not, and light was unique in this kind of response. Everyday objects behaved as expected. So there was a crisis in the field and everyone was trying to figure out how their measurements might be wrong, whereas Einstein just said "hmm let's just stop assuming that time is universal and instead everyone has local time that can be altered by their own speed relative to light." And THEN when he put that thought down in terms of basic math equations, his equations predicted all of the data that physicists were stumped by, and it predicted some non-intuitive results from experiments that had not been done yet, which were later confirmed.&#x200B;Sorry for the history lesson if you already know all of that, but my point is if you want to convince people that they're wrong, you have to show how your model can explain things that are currently inexplicable with existing models. 
<|endoftext|>Because you do not understand the fundamental differences between science and religion, which is self-critique. Scientists publish findings, and other scientists work to disprove or replicate those findings. This check is how we maintain some standards. There are no checks in religion. There is a doctrine, and no one within the structure may challenge it. 
<|endoftext|>No, if you can simplify it and call it complex, then that is what it is simplified.I'm not sure how reality can be understood, but needing to simplify it doesn't seem to make sense... why, just because it's perceived as easier in our current way of thinking?How much got misunderstood by simplifying reality to conduct a "scientific experiment"?
<|endoftext|>That doesnt make any sense at all. Can you please explain what you mean? Soldiers stealing oil? What?
<|endoftext|>Plato believed in castes, that means he believed that some people were better than others just by the social status into which they were born. Concepts of civil rights and equality hadn't been invented yet. There were slaves and indentured servants and starving people in Plato's day. He wrote what he knew of the world in his time, when city development and civic life was still in a very early stage. I think you may be judging him too harshly. He was a writer, not freaking Spartacus.
<|endoftext|>Yeah, and "Jesus" did not repudiate slavery, what a horrible person. Or we can look at how the world and norms at the time shaped them, and choose not to indict them for not living up to the moral standards of the 21st century western world...
<|endoftext|>Ok so if I'm not legitimately casting a spell, what am I doing? What's the correct action I need to take? Your whole post is confusing and indirect. We need directions instructions. Nothing vague and metaphorical. 
<|endoftext|>no i dont believe traders are personally responsible for the financial crisis lol, and to hold that belief is misinformed. there are a lot of market forces that resulted in the crisis. be sure though- traders being over-exposed to real estate risk is one of themi believe the organizations that incorrectly rated clos and cmbs are at fault. its not illegal to sell a financial product and theres always risk involved. the rating of the products is a barometer for risk, so when they are not fitting, its easy for banks to become over exposed. mainly i blame irresponsible borrowers and lenders though (low rates). theyre sort of the root cause of the crisis.and as much as you guys would like to believe that the bailouts were simply because banks are buddy-buddy with the government, it was more to prevent total financial collapse. after all, banks (were, and still are) the backbone of any capitalist regime
<|endoftext|>interesting read. i would hesitate to take the word of one anonymous money manager from some anonymous hedge fund as gospel though although there is an ever increasing trend towards passive investing (at least for now) as its lower cost and tends to counter intuitively beat active investing.i would be more interested though if you could point me to a single red flag company, that despite lacking the merits or fit into an index, it remains on the index. this could indicate better something malicious. if all the companies on the index well, belong on the index, then theres really no substantial argument.
<|endoftext|>logic bro.. the libor scandal doesnt prove the entire market is fixed... it proves that banks at one time were willing to increase or decrease libor to profit on specific trade positions.. why wouldnt they lol. they are the ones who determine libor. this isnt some deep malicious conspiracy. and, this particular scandal proves private sector bank control (like jpm or gs) lmao not the fed or any of the government banks you mentioned. youre right in that fed controls money supply, but in reality they just infrequently raise or lower rates a small fraction of a percent (in response to current market conditions) in efforts to control growth. its quite an overstatement to say they control all markets lol. im not being willfully ignorant, im being realistic and pragmatic. in reality its you being willfully ignorant, succumbing to confirmation biases based on false pretense. if you want to debate any of these points though, i welcome it
<|endoftext|> Please tell this guy, that he is destroying health, post it in his thread
<|endoftext|>Not sure what scientific journals youre reading, but no anthropologist thinks human intelligence changed like youre describing in the last hundreds of years.
<|endoftext|>No problem! Trust me I've experienced much much more rudeness from others in the science field.My field is specifically genomics, because of that I needed to understand the 3d structure of the genome from the bottom up in order to understand [this]( kind of thing, I stumbled on the only way to build large structures from the bottom up, a unified theory of physics (not my own!) Due to my expertise it made sense to take a structural, biological take on seeing if a new theory can explain something simply that was very complex before. So I decided to build DNA and the amino acids from the bottom up, in 3D, and the pieces all yielded 3d building blocks that look just like lewis structures but 3D, very hard to ignore.The thing is we live at an interesting time, where almost everything CAN be explained and has been using complicated theories. What a new theory will do is not necessarily explain all the unknown, but it will explain what other theories can (observables), and then some, using a smaller number of rules.
<|endoftext|>Ah, you actually don't understand how a society formulates a creation myth based off of the best available knowledge. Creation myths are true according to the information of the time.Just because it's a "scientific theory" doesn't mean it doesn't take the role of creation myth.
<|endoftext|>That's what the point of this thread is about. Science is becoming a religion. The peer-review process is being abused. Corporate interests are steering studies for desired results. The gate-keeping of information is preventing real innovation from occurring. 
<|endoftext|>You can only be said to know what you are talking about when you can understand and explain a complex phenomena in simple terms...Understanding something and being able to explain it doesn't effect the truth of the explanation. It actually makes it better.
<|endoftext|>lol thats the point brother, you used a weak ass strawman so I gave an equivalent on a different conspiracy 
<|endoftext|>No doubt, they didnt have a chance to live up to modern moral standards *because they were literally inventing them at that time*...
<|endoftext|>Your questions are legitimate...but the answers you want to hear aren't the ones you will get. There is no "magical" answer to these.What it takes is a journey of one's self to discover one's self. It is such a personal journey that it is not the same for each individual. What I found helpful was to start researching spiritual alchemy...The process of changing one from the inside out. First you must be able to identify who you truly are and what you truly believe. Ask yourself...Why do I believe the things that I think are so. Is it because my parents told this to me? I was taught them in school? I went to church as a kid and that's why I believe them? You have to be able to identify the programs that are running in your subconscious that affects the way you look at the world and interpret it. Then you need to be able to destroy those...then and only then, can you start to reshape the way that reality can appear to you.A word of warning...If your committed to this process, it can be scary, daunting and lead to a total revolution of you as a person. But oh so liberating and freeing once you start to see personal progress.
<|endoftext|>There is no map to enlightenment. Religions have been trying to do exactly this for thousands of years, largely without success./u/3rdeyenotblind has some excellent advice.It is a personal journal, and it is different for each person. The first thing to do is to investigate the source of your thoughts and beliefs and attempt to determine whether these thoughts are actually yours. If not, where do they come from? Do you want to choose to continue to believe them? If so, why (or why not)?A meditative practice is an excellent tool for exploring. It does not matter whether you practice yoga, keep a daily sit spot, practice mindfulness with a mobile phone app, or whatever, so long as you do practice. Faith is the guide. Find your faith, and you will find your map.
<|endoftext|>Okay. So that person is being super vague under the guise of trying to help. He is talking about *Magick*."Spells" aren't supernatural. The whole thing is basically about finding a way to associate things to keep you dedicated to imposing your will on either yourself or others.I have a necklace. It was gifted to me by my brother. One day I just decided "this is going to relax me". Now when I wear it and get flustered, I can feel it under my shirt and it helps me not get pissed. Just the gravity of it. That's a spell. You could very well just call "spells" "decisions" Just make associations that relate to you. 
<|endoftext|>I think one part of the confusion is OP has misspelled 'magick'. Speaking of which what is 'spelling' and why don't we call putting letters together to make words, lettering or wording? Also consider we call the most negative or forbidden words "curse" words. So curses and spells.. sounds a bit like Harry Potter but afaik we can't make things levitate or fly on brooms. Magick is defined as "the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will"The reason we speak is so that people **hear** and **respond** to what we are saying. If a parent were to say to their child "Go to the store and buy me some milk." and 30 minutes later the child is walking back into the house milk in hand; The parent has just effectively used magick. Had they not uttered those spells and in that order they would still be milk-less. We know that sounds and vibrations have an effect on human physiology. Everyday we listen to music that has an effect on our mood or even cause us to dance. Now imagine how powerful a technology like radio or television could be in using words or spells to manipulate people into ['conforming with your will'.]( 
<|endoftext|>Seek direction from yourself by inquiring into the true nature of yourself and reality. Don't look for direction externally. Ask yourself a million times and in a million ways "what am I".
<|endoftext|>You can downplay the significance of LIBOR all you want but the IBS and IMF are certainly in on the fix and made public declarations there wasn't fixing but there was. We are talking about 350$ trillion in derivatives, student loans, pensions, etc. that are manipulated. The fed controls the money supply and could induce bull or bear markets at will and has in the past. In a perfect world we would have rational efficient markets and no bad actors but let's be real here it's all a crock of shit if you dig deep enough.

<|endoftext|>If you need to simply something, then you maybe only understood that you could not understand it in its complete
<|endoftext|>I didnt. You say the earth is flat but youre not a scientist lol. I have empirical evidence because I work in that field. Its like youre saying Im lying to people lol.What I meant is do you think all he images and videos from space are fake? Also studies etc etc. Satlites etc.? Again, no disrespect. Ive never had a real discussion with flat earth people. They usually go from that to anti vaccine, etc etc
<|endoftext|>Secret shortcut: 5 grams of psilocybin alone in the dark, followed by a full 24 hours of rest and reflection.
<|endoftext|>Correct. People don't understand the innate value of the journey itself. Understanding will elude those who do not become the answer they seek. To become the answer, to find the knowledge, to be the thing which knows what it didn't before, it's all about the journey. It's a becoming, not a knowing. That's at the root at pretty much all occult systems. The big answers are ones nobody can provide for you.People like the one you're responding to are even close to asking the questions. They're still fetuses asleep in the womb. The womb being this matrix.
<|endoftext|>Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism offer pretty clear maps to enlightenment. The Council of Nicea fucked that up for Christianity. 
<|endoftext|>Yes... Aleister Crowley's differentiation. He did understand language as symbols and symbols tied to consciousness- but the little I've read from him didn't address Universal balance. I responded to the skeptical user and addressed that. While I wouldn't necessarily agree with that example, because we cannot exist without interaction- interaction is not without cause and effect, and the effect doesn't always change consciousness, (in this case, because obedience would already be a part of the state of consciousness in a relationship between parent and child).God bless.
<|endoftext|>Is this a strawman argument youre trying to setup? Try to answer my original question. What authority do you trust more than science if its so flawed? Religion? Government? Media? By nature you have to trust other people in order to learn in this complex world, and I stand firm scientific theory is the best shot we have at knowledge as a human race. 
<|endoftext|>By nature you have to trust other people in order to learn in this complex worldYour premise is incorrect and implies a requirement for an intellectual authority. Personally I trust spirituality and spiritual teachings. They can be verified by an individual, it could be argued they are only verifiable by individuals and not groups.That 'best shot' at knowledge was just shown by myself and numerous other people in this thread to be corrupted to the core by interest groups. Not wanting to accept that is called cognitive dissidence. Refer to my well analogy. 
<|endoftext|>Never said I was a scientist . Im an intelligence analyst as I mentioned and I work with satlites and MQ-9. Do you work with anything space related or just get info form conspiracy websites? If the earth was flat that all of that would fall right out of window which would mean my eyes and other thousands of people in the world are going crazy and seeing things that arent there. I give you plenty of proofIf the earth were flat Russia wouldnt just be able to fly from there country around to our California borders and our ships wouldnt be able to leave from our ports and port in China through the pacific. This isnt smart stuff just common sense. I know pilots who flew antrtica missions and heavy bombers who flew long missions around the world. They do it all the time. Why havent they fallen off the earth? I debriefed these pilots. do you prove the earth is flat? How come no one has fallen off the earth or hit big walls of ice? Just curious if you can send me some info that would be awesome.I can never get real answers and the dudes are usually crazy af. Educate me.The less educated always seem to fall into these crazy conspiracies like Gucci mane being cloned and stupid shit like that lol. Always the same dudes.
<|endoftext|>master yourself.once you have zero addictions , the fittest you can be, and have conquered materialism... you will know the answer.i'm not even halfway there yet... but it feels right.
<|endoftext|>I guess the thought process is that the earth is flat and motionless by all accounts of my personal experience and I have come to find the ball earth evidence insufficient for my personal belief. Part of the mind fuck is that you have to prove the earth is flat based on the axiom the earth is a ball.Look up the history of Jesuit spread of ball earth theory in the 17th century, China thought the earth was flat until 1600s when a Jesuit priest gained favor in the Imperial court. They must be crazy af in China yo. History of Antarctica, like how it wasn't discovered until 1820 and the Operations there with Admiral Byrd and his infamous TV interview. Ancient cultures and the belief in flat earth and a firmament, extra credit for Werhner von Braun's tombstone bible verse. See Operation Domino, Fishbowl, Starfish. That's a good chunk of stuff to start with. 
<|endoftext|>Very interesting bro Ill start right now. Sounds and cool not gonna lie. Ill get back to you on my opinion. Thanks man 
<|endoftext|>No problem, a lot people write flat earth off without doing their homework first.Like pretty much anyone I thought flat earth was retarded before "looking into it".If you are being intellectually honest you should come away from flat earth theory with at least some cool history lessons.
<|endoftext|>Glad to see this discussion. I think small changes could yield big results. I don't see one solution or fix or answer to how the sub should run, what it should look like and what should be at the top. imo there's no magic bullet due to the nature of the subject, namely- Conspiracies are based on disagreement, no? discussing, researching, thinking about them... isn't it all built on seeking some truth, understanding, information or popular consensus that should be addressed/accepted but is not-- because people disagree. on events, on motive, on sources and evidence, etc. And I'm just talking about folks participating in good faith here; I don't think it's an exaggeration to say it'd be hard to find... 3 people in this sub who believe the same truths behind all the most debated conspiracies. There's gonna be one mystery where 3 smart people agree 9 times, get to the 10th, look at the same info and see 3 totally different things. That seems inseparable from a conspiracy community to me. It's not convenient in terms of, you know, subreddit tranquility, but hey it's a unique place. most subreddits like I dunno fucking... /r/ITookAPicture- aren't based on people passionately debating controversial issues and trying to convince or exchange information with people, who are probably like-minded except for all the stuff they passionately disagree about. Even the debate-oriented subs like whatever /r/asksomefella aren't remotely similar. imo this sub is unique and will always have disagreement on everything from posts to moderation. honest arguments. legit bafflement at how someone could believe this but not that. For the same reasons there's probably just gonna be friction or misunderstanding between the community and the mods. so again l think it's more fruitful to look for progress than solutions. I mean, would you want to be a moderator here? really? you want to deal with the notoriously combative and antagonistic CelineHagbard? jkbut really, think about the (volunteer) job description. there's 4,000 people here atm and you have to clean up and make judgement calls about what breaks which rules while thousands of anons argue over the missing sum when something don't add up. and you're constantly insulted. and there's like admins that pop in occasionally. In return you get some power and responsibility for a subject and community you care about and want to affect, even though your job is mostly dealing with its worst parts. I don't want to meet the person who spends substantial time modding here and doesn't get pissed off on occasion. I'm not saying this in defense of the mods, they can defend themselves and they make mistakes. cause humans do that. so do those shifty robot mods. But I'd sure as hell defend the mods over some other 19 redditors who think they wouldn't quit after a week. (just no one tell them there's a public modlog though. if I was trying to pull one over i'd get rid of that thing stat.Anyway, as someone who has never contributed anything of value to the sub, or regularly participated, or done anything to earn trust here, I'm sure my opinion carries a great deal of weight. For the sub's future I see plenty of opportunities for general, can-live-with-it improvements. Possibilities: clarifying rules and consquences, communication, transparency, what's politics vs what's a good topic that is also political. post limits? tags/filters?. Poke the admins with a stick? (sue them? ~~make the sub private until you solve a riddle~~ that's dumb I was thinking about trolls, like under a bridge. But hey, I bet anything yall could write an article a decent site would frontpagerize. for real, fucking no one likes the popular media these days. they're desperate for something that critical 15-65 demographic finds interesting. cause it turns out selling your data isn't a lucrative longterm strategy. and then the media moguls see a kid on patreon making $15,000 a month $3 at a time because they're fucking engaging. and they're like wtf why won't they pay $15 a month for my newspaper. we're running out of moguls man, they keep jum Last, on the past of this sub- can only speak for myself but my memory's a rascal. I find it really worthwhile to check out rconspiracy 2,3, 5 whatever years ago once in a while (via archive for instance). Obviously some things change and some things don't, but it's never the things I expect. and personally seeing old front pages and old discussions adds a little perspective to the present discussions.
<|endoftext|>I am an extremely casual user for this subreddit. I don't post here often at all, I mostly just lurk now and then. That probably makes me look more then a little suspicious what with current going ons, but I wanted to throw out my two cents here.This place, being under constant brigade attack as it is, is simply unusable. The core community is to small to generate momentum to overrule the obvious brigading. That's how bigger subs like r/PCMasterrace dealt with this crap, it was so big and has so much momentum that it just brushed it aside.I honestly don't know if there is a solution to this. The r/politics and other subreddit hiveminds have decided we are their blood enemy now, and those types will not stop unless utterly and completely shut down. I honestly don't know how you would go about doing that while preserving the ideals of free speech this place is built on in the first place.
<|endoftext|>What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy? ~Mahatma Gandhi
<|endoftext|>I'm almost certain this will get buried, but that's fine.What this sub needs most is the "No Meta" rule active *all the time*. If you want to talk about users of this sub make a self post, or take it to one of the litany of subs dedicated to talking about the users here. It's the most ridiculous and disrupting nonsense in every single thread we have users with "you guys are nuts" or "this place is full of t_D people" or some other such non-relevant disruption.
<|endoftext|>As long as there's no mod accountability process, no transparent election process, no term limits, then Reddit is a stacked deck.
<|endoftext|>I propose sub wide contest mode until November 7th. Vote counts can influence a voters decision and by hiding them we can make sure no one on this sub is directly exposed to astroturfed propaganda. 
<|endoftext|>Could we have a requirement that in every submission statement the poster has to reference the conspiracy they are addressing?
<|endoftext|>This post so far: how to keep users and mods happy when they clash.What we want: how mods can help us to be able to focus on conspiracy in a damn conspiracy sub!EDIT: totally downvote out of the gate. Does that mean someone with votepower wants:To help us NOT focus on conspiracy?To focus instead on problem-user-mods?Hmmm this may be a clue to whats going on. Vote scratch the messenger...
<|endoftext|>this is just a trick to get me banned again. I just got reinstated, keeping quiet for now. I'll just read the comments.
<|endoftext|>I think its hilarious the sheer amount of turnover of mods, the propensity for sub mods to be suspended BY ADMINS, hell even the top mod has gotten some nice Admin approved vacation, the total political slant to one side thus making this sub an echo chamber for a certain type, and the persistent effort to do things secretly and with no consideration for sub user bases wishes. Why the rule for account age requirements when the mods go through and approve and allow brand new accounts to participate. Hell, when that rule was made suddenly there was a flurry of perfectly aged accounts ready rearing to participate. But yet again only from one political viewpointWhile mod log helps. They clearly are communicating elsewhere. Likely on discord. How about the sub mods tamp down the blatant preferential treatment of certain users and posts that are clearly from a single standpoint. This sub has been a joke since the election. And it warrants the ostracism it receives.  
<|endoftext|>Is there any sort of review process for bans?I mainly ask because u/Aleister went on a banning spree which you guys have defended as only removing "bad actors" and such. However, one of those banned was an ex-moderator for "brown nosing," and the ban was only lifted about a week later because Aleister caught an admin ban and you needed someone to fill the hole. Presumably they are not a "bad actor" since you guys have since given them mod privileges, so it looks like Aleister was just acting on personal grudges which throws the rest of that ban wave into question, if not all of his actions.This suggests that there's not any sort of process to ensure that your mods are actually banning bad actors and not just carrying out personal grievances. How many of those Aleister banned were not actually warranted, he just didn't like them for whatever reason? People point at the mod log as an example of the mods here being "transparent, " but it's frankly useless because any suspicious bannings (and there are many) are hand waved by the mods as "bad actors" (and citing the mod log often catches users a ban for Rule 10). There's just a major trust issue between the users and mods, and if the mods want it to be fixed they're going to have to go above and beyond in showing why a ban is deserved, or why a problem user has had their ban rescinded.
<|endoftext|>Show me how this whole discussion is going to be different than any other post AP puts a sticky on.It's literally all that ever ends up getting discussed imo.Title should be "How to bait a brigade"...because that's exactly what's going to happen.Am I wrong?The past - Is permanently irretrievable.The present - According to users who get the most upvotes in most discussion threads on the front page (especially anything to do with MSM narratives regarding current conspiracies that have anything to do with politics) this sub is T_D 2.0. According to users who get downvoted into oblivion in those threads..it's not. You do the math.The future - Partisan shit slinging, blatant inorganic vote manipulation of front page posts that cover anything to do with current political events, continued anonymous vote suppression of conspiracy speculations that don't follow the MSM narrative and more cries of victim-hood by users who for the most part received a ban for generally being toxic asshats and really don't believe in most conspiracy theories and don't take part in discussions that don't involve politics.More brigades...lots more brigades. I'm sure the admins of reddit are working really hard to curtail this phenomenon that only seems to be observed by the genuine users of r/conspiracy. (I guess we all have our tinfoil hats screwed on a little to tight)Continued attacks on mods because we all know that until this sub is completely taken over by users that believe the truth can only be presented by the MSM nothing is going to change. I'm just a ray of fuckin sunshine...but am I wrong? Let me know when this comment hits -150. Oh...almost forgot...you're going to ask me to focus on what can be done to make r/conspiracy a better sub now aren't you? Why spend time whining about how things are...right?You know what's funny...I guarantee you, the top comment of this post...will be whining about how shitty this sub is because of how it's modded...guaranteed.Because that's what they're really after isn't it? Mods that parrot the MSM narrative.Edit: I was surprised to see my comment made it to +8....that's obviously changing now. I'm sure no one is having a discussion on discord right now regarding the formation of the incoming brigade. Or maybe they just hit a notification that alerts their "circle of friends"...I always thought that was a pretty obvious tool designed specifically for brigading. Zuckerberg would be proud.
<|endoftext|>What will keep this sub from getting quarantined like /r/911truth ? Is anyone worried about the long term survival of this sub? Reddit continues to March toward their IPO.
<|endoftext|>We need to create a "gentlemen's guide to TMOR disruption tactics" and allow users to post sections of it whenever a TMOR shill shows up ie. without ban repercussions.
<|endoftext|>Thank you mods for enabling a user-level discussion aimed at the mod-level and higher levels of oversight!I wish there was some way to completely defuse the issue of political ideologies at least for the duration of this discussion. It is clear that part of the problem users are fighting to overcome is the overwhelming turn of this sub from a conspiracy focus to a partisan focus.Everyone with any sense knows that conspiracy involves politics. What was JFK - a political assasination. However that assasination would never have become a conspiracy without the growing awareness of massive evidence indicating foul play, being covered up at the highest level.What we see now on this subreddit is purely politics with no assasination, no evidence, no coverup, no high level interventions, and not even the time required to assess these factors that lead to a true conspiracy subject.In short, we have political forces hijacking our discussions in order to achieve immediate short term results in the non-conspiracy world of partisan politics.In my mind, we asked mods to stop it. That didnt happen. Why?EDIT: here is an analogy for what Im trying to get at: lets say Im a geologist. As a geologist I am involved with drilling. Every once and a while I go somewhere and drill to find out what I need to understand geology better. Then one day the drilling company shows up at my house and starts drilling a bunch of holes in my front yard. I have to explain that Im interested in drilling but Im not a driller myself and I certainly dont want someone to come to my home and ruin it by drilling a bunch of holes. Its not appropriate and it shouldnt be legal. Mods - you should be on my side, not theirs.
<|endoftext|>Conspiracy of 3-4 years ago basically won the culture war.People quit believing in MSM fairytales, the people who once populated this place are now winning battles and the alternative media is now more popular in views/engagement than the MSM.The MSM now is trying to "occupy" alt-media like YouTube, Reddit etc etc and working with big tech they are trying to shut down the alt-media or rather to just make YouTube/Reddit ECT ECT the new way people watch CNN and company.The aftermath is all the good conversation we had here years ago is moving to other platforms like minds.com gab.ai etc etc. No hard feelings, it's like watching Myspace slowly die when Facebook showed up. If your frustrated with this decline then it's just because you're a late-adopter. Everyone who matters has already migrated, a few of us still comment here to torture ourselves or out of morbid curiosity watching this site die.Look at politics right now, the headlines and comments are so fucking insane and hyperbolic that it looks like an Alex Jones fever dream.We won folks. You know who you are, we just kicked the ever living shit out of the globalist and everything happening here that says otherwise is an attempted salvage operation by the globalist.To all of those who fought here with us years ago in the age of conspiratard, thanks for your service and support. I hope you find the new venues of free speech out there, we'll be there waiting for you.

Having control of these means you could pretty much control the entire 'democracy']( Future Generations Ask How Americans Let Authoritarianism Take Hold?](
<|endoftext|>One thing that I have noticed recently is that some of you ask where does the community go if r/conspiracy is lost? I personally doubt that there would be a replacement. Sure, you could find new forums to speak in and share information but they will be constructed for you, not by you. These echo chambers will be populated by the splintered communities of the past and curated in a way to control the conversation.R/conspiracy needs to be a place people can feel free to share their opinions and information. Follow the rules, practice proper etiquette, and give others opinions the respect they deserve. I understand that there is now a flood of fake/controlled users, but that is something we will just have to accept and work around.
<|endoftext|>On Gab.Gab shouldn't have been shut down, because Gab shouldn't have existed in the first place. Those people and views shouldn't have been intellectually quarantined; because toxic and stupid opinions aren't contagious. Anyone going over to Gab would have been indoctrinated because there was no intellectual inner check to that community, not an inner check provide by the platform(forced censorship) but by other users (natural and organic logical objection). To cut those people and views off from the rest of society, is to normalize their opinions amongst themselves. The Pittsburgh shooter thought his views were right, cause his whole community said it was. I'd argue if that community hadn't of been intellectually segregated from Twitter in the first place he wouldn't have felt as confident and assured in his views. All opinions can and should be expressed, most importantly, the views and opinions from others about those views. To cut these people off from the rest of Twitter, is to cut bad views and urges off from a persons rational inner check or conscience. What happens to the urges they get unleashed with devastating harmful effects to all.This is a political opinion, and it shouldn't be here, it should be over on mainstream reddit
<|endoftext|>Is there any way that you can prevent raiders from easily censoring comments? It's ridiculous that all these people need to do is to organize into little groups, get 5 down votes per user, and spam propaganda to pretty much hijack and destroy a discussion.
<|endoftext|>Questions for Mods:1. What data can you see that an ordinary user cannot?2. Do you have tools to help you to identify bots and shills?3. Are there policies that limit the number of puppet accounts you can use?4. Can a single mod with multiple accounts vote on the same post or comment?5. Do mods combine with each other and nonplayers to vote and is that considered ethical in the reddit system?
<|endoftext|>This is an important Round Table. To preface ill start with an Alan Watts quote.Camus said there is only really one serious philosophical question, which is whether or not to commit suicide. I think there are four or five serious philosophical questions.1. Who started it? 2. Are we gonna make it? 3. Where are we gonna put it? 4. Who's gonna clean up? 5. Is it serious? No you should not kill yourself. One absolute truth is everything constantly changes, even truth. The reason or reasons you want to kill yourself will change. The rest of us need you even if it doesn't seem like it. As the african word Ubuntu translates **I am what I am because of who we all are.**Now im going to apply those 5 philosophical question to this discussion.1. Steve Huffman, Aaron Swartz and Alexis Ohanian. 2. Reddit has been an obvious success. Despite the negative sides (trolls/shills/bots/corporate influence/ect). Millions of positive ideas, pictures, and videos have rippled through humanity because it exists. We make it happen! We already made it! And we will continue to make it! 3. We put it on  and that has worked for years now. Jumping back to the negative side. With corporations, private entities, bad mods censoring our ideas, pictures, and videos. It has become apparent we need to put it elsewhere. I propose a new website be created which replicates reddits medium and layout. Or at very least a new website that replicates reddits medium and layout for the purpose of being an uncensored(to an extent), anti-corporate, bot resistant version of /r/conspiracy. I think this is of fundamental importance. 4. That would be us. How we do it is still on the table. Can we do it? Of course we can. 5. It is very serious. Without a place to share important information those in power will continue to divide and conquer. I just crunched the numbers for the geometic mean of death tolls from War from 1899 till now from Wikipedia(I know its not accurate) an estimated 150,573,368 peope have died. That is the definition of serious. We need UNITY and PEACE not death tolls in the hundreds of millions.
<|endoftext|>To everyone that went thru the first day of this circus: everything is upside down in the reality the power posters control. The top comments have the least real impact on the status of the sub. Their plan was to make this about power mods and power users - the kind of users that think they own the place - the kind of people who play games and can jigger the votes so everybody thinks they have all the answers.&#x200B;Well somebody has to call them out. The whole reason for this round table was to get the mods to own up as to why the sub has changed so drastically - to the point where real conspiracy theorists cannot find a decent discussion amongst all the imported background noise.&#x200B;That hasnt happened and it wont happen until the rest of us make a lot more waves. Something is rotten in this sub and in this post. Every sensible person can see that the first comments got 18 votes and 12 and 8 and then vote shaped the discussion with slides and alts so it looks like its just about bad actors (whose side are they really on and why do they act so wild?) and good mods doing their job. &#x200B;I think the most productive move would be to ask all mods to voluntarily step aside to assure the regular users that they are not being played or manipulated by insiders who would like this sub to self destruct.&#x200B;Im not calling any user or mod out. We all know enough - good or not - to see we have an honesty problem.
<|endoftext|>Why is an Auto-Moderator comment stickied to the top of every thread and why are the vote counts hidden here for a period of time?
<|endoftext|>I would recommend a unified strategy to combat trolls, brigading, and shilling. Mods have no power to ban these people, and admins refuse to do anything in spite of overwhelming evidence, so we should consider ways to combat them within the rules of engagement established.Many would like to see rule 10 removed, so that we can have an open discussion on shills. I see the mods' point that this will make the community more toxic, because the newer members (i.e. people who don't know how to spot [shilling techniques]( will just leave the community because they don't have the discernment to decide who is making correct accusations, and who is just poisoning the well.An interesting idea would be a rule requiring comments to contain substance. Most of the shilling involves shouting down ideas they want to suppress, because it tricks a few people and it divides the rest. A rule requiring you to explain your reasons for disagreeing with another user would kill the majority of the shilling activity off.We could even consider bans on a few common forms of logical fallacies. But that runs the risk of getting a lot of the newer people (i.e. those we actually want to reach) because they lack the skills to avoid these fallacies.In any case, continuing to focus on the shilling *behavior* is going to be the key. It doesn't matter if someone is paid to be here, if they are *acting* like a shill by bringing in logical fallacies and divisiveness instead of substantive discussion, they should be confronted about their behavior. You don't have to call someone a shill to note that their argument is fallacious and divisive, even to the point of calling out the specific tactic they are using.
<|endoftext|>If the modlog is our only way to see how the mods are spending their time here.. then where is it? Somebody link to that baby. The screenshots show how mods aren't doing their job, their playing games with their friends, like where's the tagging of MSM we've been asking for the last two years? Instead they spend their time and authority gatekeeping according to a very obvious political agenda. Just pathetic. 
<|endoftext|>This place is kind of fucked honestly, enough that I have considered abandoning efforts here and moving on to something else. It's become a war of attrition as trolls and shills degrade the conversation and drive sensible people away. As a self-described sensible person I would feel remorse jumping ship, but we're a-goin' down.\*"Is it just me? Or is the world... rising?"\*Where is the line, for each of us? Researching criminal and cult control of the levers of power is a thankless job. While I don't want David Brock and his pedo buddies to win in any way shape or form, it would be dishonest to pretend their bot and shill army is ineffective. Like we can admit news shows lie and people believe the lies without endorsing their foul tactics. We gotta live in reality. I might not be fooled as often as some but I get drawn into debates and arguments with phonies. It takes a toll emotionally.They want us to give up. We won't. But unless there are some serious changes it's going to become as self-defeating as criticizing Facebook while on Facebook as a user. Kind of a double bind here, to leave reddit or stay, neither option is all that attractive considering the circumstances. I'm thinking about a new format, maybe a website with organized articles and moderated comments. Dissent would never be deleted, but you could give warnings or bans for personal attacks. There is no justification to call someone an idiot or crazy for having a different opinion anyways.One could argue for the natural born right to stir shit, gaslight, and post divisive, disingenuous nonsense. I have had my fill of reading it.It's obvious the admins are complicit. Them deleting pizzagate was the stimulus that made me dive deeper and discover most of the accusations were true. TMOR is the admin's sociopath harassment club, they need to call someone dumb to feel smart and crazy to feel sane. I shake my head.Some of my serious research posts with lists of sources have 1,000s of views and like 10 net upvotes. That's not natural.So long and thanks for all the toxic fish. I may or may not be around as a commenter. If I post less and drift away it's not to give up on research and awareness but to find a new venue. The nature of reddit's structure is easily manipulated and too transitory.
<|endoftext|>Do not understand a word! What does "going full on meta" mean? What "this one"? Does anyone clarify it for a non-native speaker?
<|endoftext|>hope this vid can cure your boredom, happy tuesday! [
<|endoftext|>Can we get the mods to start removing random opinion articles getting posted here? If the author is trying to use it to support a *conspiracy* theory, that's fine, but there is just so much spill over from r/politics and r/news - most of it obviously political - and it's getting annoying.
<|endoftext|>Maybe the heavily brigaded ## ["Please shut down the Manipulative Down-Voting" Petition]( be considered by the mods, either?
<|endoftext|>Why isn't the "send replies to my inbox" option not a one click question in preferences rather than something we need to deal with and click every time we make a submission?
<|endoftext|>If I was the benevolent dictator of r/conspiracy, I would go to approved commenters only. Each person who wants to participate has to fill out an application.In order to participate, the applicant has to be "conspiracy-positive". Debates over individual conspiracies would be very welcome but anyone who is skeptical of conspiracies *in general* would not be allowed to post or comment.The application would also weed out racists.Acceptance that politics is nothing more than the entertainment wing of the shadow government is necessary Attached to the application must be an OC post, to demonstrate the applicants commitment to thinking critically about a subject and to share it with others.Accepted applicants would have their OC displayed in a stickied megathread.For a little bit of time participation would fall off a cliff and it would be hundreds of hours of work for the mods but this is my dream. 
<|endoftext|>i feel like we could use more pretending to be a open free speech forum.there are far too many people actually trying to learn whats going on, and wanting to make the world a better place, we could quickly stamp out this unwanted behavior with more shadow banning!
<|endoftext|>I've said a few things here and there, but [this is all I really want to say today.](
<|endoftext|>The issue in implementing tags here [Politics], [Reptilians], [etc] is everything can be defined as politics if you try hard enough.We have been discussing this idea of trialing tags for months.I think we should at least try to implement it when we all decide what to do when this thread is done.
<|endoftext|>What are we going to do with the umpteen daily political posts that is basically drowning actual, proper conspiracy theories?Limit political posts to one or two days a week, perhaps?What about politics only on the weekends (which are quieter anyway)?
<|endoftext|>Can you check if some top "contributers" always post around the same. Maybe by binning short time windows and doing a pearson correlation analysis?
<|endoftext|>Could you tell us who the top 3 banned users are and the top 3 users with the most comments removed?Edit: users replies were deleted, but they showed rmfn with over 200 comments removed. The next closest non-bot that wasn't mass removed was 60-something. It also showed him and putinlovescats with 5-6 bans each. 
<|endoftext|>Lets hunt for some shills. Give us the top 5 user names that down vote the most and terms that appear in those threads and/or comments.Or how about trends that either massively upvote or downvote a thread/comment within minutes. For example, If someone posts a thread about Monsanto causing cancer, then you see a wave of downvotes, who were those users? Or a comment arguing against the claim, then all of a sudden it gets +20 upvotes, who were those users?
<|endoftext|>Good intent but imho impossible to make the cut: some news outlet somewhere has mentioned 9-11 or UFOs in the last 2 hrs let alone whats been blathered the last 2 months.Possibly could work if we only allowed mods to judiciously cross post r/news worldnews politics to keep us informed but then absolutely ban topics being actively covered in those subs
<|endoftext|>You are absolutely correct! Reddit's design for moderation is complete bullshit and honestly fucked up. I will at the least say this, the mods here offer a mod log, which speaks volumes for the amount of shit they receive for continuing to offer it. Can anyone else show me a similar sub this large, that offers the same transparency as here?
<|endoftext|>The soul is the same in all living creatures, although the body of each is different. -Hippocrates
<|endoftext|>I'd like to expand on this and ask why some users are given so much more leeway than others? There are a couple of prominent users who have been banned and unbanned dozens of times but still keep coming back somehow. What do these users offer to this sub that outweighs all of the rules they constantly break? Why should any user be given that much leniency when they clearly aren't changing their behavior after each ban? 
<|endoftext|>Just seen this buisness here tooUser was banned by ambiguously yesterday for what looks like rule 10, same user unbanned by axolotl today What is also odd is ambiguously banned the guy but approved his rule breaking comment. The rules seem to depend on which mod sees the report and which phase the moon is in was [this thread]( 
<|endoftext|>Unfortunately, your comment contains images that violate reddit's [TOS]( negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; orIt will be reinstated when you scratch out the usernames.
<|endoftext|>Aleister and RecoveringGrace both had their accounts suspended. As far as I've seen, the official explanation is that Aleister manually approved a comment that provided real life information on someone, aka doxxing. I'm not sure if there was more to it than that, but it is kind of weird how we still haven't had a mod post about this.RecoveringGrace is a bit more convoluted, so someone please correct me if I have any details wrong. I think they got in an argument with some TMOR user and threatened to doxx them. They were given a temporary suspension for this, and then proceeded to message the user with an alt account, aka ban evading. That's when they were given the permanent suspension.Either way, that's two of the five newest mods who are now suspended. A third had resigned at one point but is now back. 3/5 is not a very high success rate, so again I want to bring up how flawed this secret vote process seems to be. Edit: To address some of the other mods, creq and IntellisaurDinoAlien haven't been active in 3 months. Amos_quito hasn't been active in 9 months. I have no clue what is going on in their real lives, but it sorta seems like the mods are dropping like flies around here. 
<|endoftext|>To be fair, it is listed under the criteria of a Submission Statement - but I've never seen it enforced.
<|endoftext|>There is no rule that requires every post here to have a uniquely identifiable conspiracy.[Please see my response here](
<|endoftext|>Completely agree. There's very inorganic activity on certain topics where even considering a conspiracy theory as possible gets you downvoted to oblivion. It's obvious and ridiculous, and we need more ways to combat it. 
<|endoftext|>What if the default postings here were flaired as [No Meta], meaning that comments in a specific thread are restricted to the topic posted and anything else (shitting on users, mods, the sub, etc) would be removed?/u/CelineHagbard has made quite a few posts of that nature.
<|endoftext|>I'm curious which side of the political spectrum do you think it shifted to? Because I hear claims it shifted to the far right, but find that certain topics are heavily manipulated by mainstream left-wing viewpoints. 
<|endoftext|>I think its hilarious the sheer amount of turnover of mods, the propensity for sub mods to be suspended BY ADMINS, hell even the top mod has gotten some nice Admin approved vacation, the total political slant to one side thus making this sub an echo chamber for a certain type, and the persistent effort to do things secretly and with no consideration for sub user bases wishes. APs issue with reddit was not a disciplinary action but a connection issue where *they* did not like how he was connecting to the site (Tor nodes IIRC).Why the rule for account age requirements when the mods go through and approve and allow brand new accounts to participate. New accounts will occassionally message the mods to have a newer account approved, and they are granted on a case by case basis after they explain the reasoning and let us know their other account. You don't see any of this.Hell, when that rule was made suddenly there was a flurry of perfectly aged accounts ready rearing to participate. But yet again only from one political viewpoint[Citation required here]While mod log helps. They clearly are communicating elsewhere. Likely on discord. Who is communicating on discord? New accounts?How about the sub mods tamp down the blatant preferential treatment of certain users and posts that are clearly from a single standpoint. AP already addressed this.This sub has been a joke since the election. And it warrants the ostracism it receives.  Then why are you here?
<|endoftext|>You are not wrong. The pattern of manipulation is very obvious to any honest, long-term, organic user. 
<|endoftext|>I think we need some mod elections. Aleister, Grace and the others were downed and a lot of mods are inactive so, a new group is needed.Nice to see you around here dude!
<|endoftext|>but am I wrong? Probably not. This is definitely a last ditch. But its a stand at least and not a roll over and accept it
<|endoftext|> EDIT: here is an analogy for what Im trying to get at: lets say Im a geologist. As a geologist I am involved with drilling. Every once and a while I go somewhere and drill to find out what I need to understand geology better. Then one day the drilling company shows up at my house and starts drilling a bunch of holes in my front yard. I have to explain that Im interested in drilling but Im not a driller myself and I certainly dont want someone to come to my home and ruin it by drilling a bunch of holes. Its not appropriate and it shouldnt be legal. Mods - you should be on my side, not theirs.Shouldn't the analogy be that people invaded not your home, but the third-party location where you also go to dig?
<|endoftext|>In short, we have political forces hijacking our discussions in order to achieve immediate short term results in the non-conspiracy world of partisan politics.Exactly this. Hope we can find a solution, or at least a way to mitigate it. 
<|endoftext|>You should be a talented enough dialectician to understand that pendula swing, often back to the exact position they started from.Unfortunately your breakaway a couple years ago didnt bring all the survivors from the Titanic - is that why you sound so icy?
<|endoftext|>Questions for Mods:1. What data can you see that an ordinary user cannot?Not much more besides comments the robots remove for age requirements. And user reports. And the neverending modmail.2. Do you have tools to help you to identify bots and shills?It's mostly humint at this point (for me).3. Are there policies that limit the number of puppet accounts you can use?For reddit? I don't think so.4. Can a single mod with multiple accounts vote on the same post or comment?They could, in theory. That's an way way to get a site-wide ban though. 5. Do mods combine with each other and nonplayers to vote and is that considered ethical in the reddit system?Sounds like a brigade, which is against site-wide rules.
<|endoftext|>Yes!And FTR I consider myself to be somewhat of a political atheist despite *incessant* claims to the contrary.
<|endoftext|>That would be us. How we do it is still on the table. Can we do it? Of course we can.Yeah, we take them out with a class action labor lawsuit. 
<|endoftext|>I disagree. First, backing down and running from such a well known conspiracy forum sends the wrong message. Second, if we did successfully move to a new platform we would face the same obstacles we have already.EDIT: Third, from everything I can sense about the weird recent changes in the sub, it is likely that the power structure wants this sub gone, broken, crippled, not to come back and fix itself in an honest effort to remain who we authentically are - conspiracy theorists.
<|endoftext|> The whole reason for this round table was to get the mods to own up as to why the sub has changed so drastically - to the point where real conspiracy theorists cannot find a decent discussion amongst all the imported background noise.Why do you think the mods are responsible for this?Why do you think the mods have control over this?I think the most productive move would be to ask all mods to voluntarily step aside to assure the regular users that they are not being played or manipulated by insiders who would like this sub to self destruct.With all due respect, that's quite the leap to make.This sub would be nuked by the admins in an instant without a dedicated team of mods to make sure content here strictly adheres to the rules of reddit.At the very least we need *additions* to the current team.
<|endoftext|>I think the vote count hiding is either a Reddit thing, or at the least, a sub-specific setting. IIRC, a sub can set the amount of time votes are hidden for (or it just defaults to an hour or something).
<|endoftext|>Many would like to see rule 10 removed, so that we can have an open discussion on shills.I was always under the impression that we were allowed to do this as long it was an actual detailed post that points out facts and isn't just someone calling another user a shill because they disagree. I've seen several comments and posts over the years where someone will point out an account that only posts from one domain, or has a history that matches up with a bunch of banned accounts, or stuff like that. I guess now might be a good time to get the mods to weigh in on this. 
<|endoftext|>Shills are a real challenge. Its like keeping troublemakers out of a public street party. They have to get really obnoxious before anyone can try to eject them.One shill aspect is that often they come not to discuss conspiracy but to deny it even exists. Ok - we know some conspiracies are on the edge - but why would someone go to the trouble to come to the sub just to deny something most ordinary people dont even know much about. Those are the ones I think have to be on a payroll. But again how do you control that?
<|endoftext|>Why even ask? If the mod running this roundtable isn't the worst offender, he's certainly the most transparent and prolific. The haircut's troll army of propagandists and shuteyes infested this sub and now call those of us who point out their bullshit "shills." Our sub has been weaponized, and not by Soros or CTR. I'd like to see it saved, but expect instead to watch its users march lockstep wherever the orange pied Piper leads them.
<|endoftext|>Meta just means we are discussing the subreddit as a whole not a single conspiracy such as 9-11This one refers to the discussion itselfBoth of these are reflexive wordings
<|endoftext|>The application would also weed out racists.And here is where you go off topic. Weeding out racists requires someone to define what type of comments are motivated by racism and which ones are acceptable. This is why you can talk shit about white people on Twitter with the most vile racist language imaginable and get away with it but one comment about planet of the apes taken out of context will get you banned.When will people learn that hate speech and free speech can't both exist at the same time?Acceptance that politics is nothing more than the entertainment wing of the shadow government is necessaryHow do you suggest that democracies advertise people who want to run for elected office? Politics is a necessary function of democracy.
<|endoftext|>I like the idea of tags and would love to see them. Sure everything can boil down to certain things like politics. But the people that take time to bitch about an occasional (assuming occasional otherwise poster may be trill) reptilian post mark politics is either bored or an asshole. No system implemented will be full proof and there will be detractors regardless. But the tags will solve a lot of the gripes I hear about this sub. I personally wont care and laugh at all the people on a counter culture sub not getting along etc and getting serious about it. That sort of stuff is the nature of us, we are always skeptical so duh we dont get along.
<|endoftext|>Maybe a time/date limit? Like 1-2 years back gets thrown into politics and the rest is ok? I'm just spitballing here.
<|endoftext|>Violence can only be concealed by a lie, and the lie can only be maintained by violence. ~Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
<|endoftext|>Also, voting on mods would just guarantee that we end up with shills for mods, since the shills, bots & brigaders have made it clear that they can always outvote us by a huge margin if they want to.Just throwing an idea out there, but you could just have public voting. Don't base it on upvotes and downvotes, but by public comments. Every vote is directly tied to a username. Then you either use automod or some other tool to ignore new accounts, accounts that have never posted here before, or whatever other system you can come up with. It'd be pretty hard to manipulate that except for someone who has a bunch of well-used alt accounts standing by.
<|endoftext|>Rather than just a straight vote, mount evidence upon evidence of poor decisions from the mod log. If there's countless examples of a mod approving, banning etc inappropriately then they should be questioned.Can't provide a sufficient answer? Get out. That way there's a clear reason for their removal rather than just 51 votes VS 49 or whatever. If the evidence is compelling I'm sure most regular users would see reason. 
<|endoftext|>Likely because they're a member of /r/conspiracy_conclave. A private sub dedicated to deciding how to run this one. Yes, banned users are tasked with aiding in the decision making behind running this sub. 
<|endoftext|> I'd like to expand on this and ask why some users are given so much more leeway than others? My favorite example is /u/rmfn Here are the subs that Ambiguous mods the subs that rmfn mods  have no horse in this race but I have seen many people here get away with shit that others are insta banned permanently for. One of the primary reasons is they are all buddy buddy, many mods work multiple subs which does 2 things. Gives friends free passes and lowers their ability to be active in a large sub conspiracy when you have a dozen subs to keep an eye on. 
<|endoftext|>why some users are given so much more leeway than others?I can only speak for myself on this issue, but every person is different, so for me it really is on a case by case basis.For the most part, I consider two different factors:1. Are they a conspiracy theorist?2. Do they have a history of posting original/quality content on /r/conspiracy?The second one is a bit easier, especially because original content is one of the many things I think makes this sub great. We all can get emotional and lose our cool, so it stands to reason that those who have a consistent track record of positive contributions to the sub should be given more chances than those that don't.As for the notion of "giving preference" to conspiracy theorists, I recognize that might be considered controversial. This does *not* mean that skeptics and debunkers aren't welcome here, quite the contrary, as the conspiracy community *needs* these individuals to keep us grounded and focused. It truly is a team effort.However, diehard debunkers who *also* break the rules are not treated with as much sympathy as diehard conspiracy theorists who do the same.Yes, in some instances this may have all the appearances of impartiality. But the way I see it, the *vast* majority of reddit is a "safe space" to essentially demean and belittle conspiracies (as was the intention of the CIA in popularizing the term in the first place).Ironically, this targeted demonization of the mere *consideration* of conspiracy theories is one of this sub's greatest defenses, since pretty much every thing that gets discussed here can be dismissed as mere "conspiracy" theory, which in many ways can be quite liberating.I hope this addresses some of your concerns!
<|endoftext|>Unfortunately, your comment contains images that violate reddit's [TOS]( negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; orIt will be reinstated when you scratch out the usernames.
<|endoftext|>Im way too lazy for that but going forward I will. So please explain how conspiracy gets around this term and condition? How does this sub give redditors the chance to change or remove their comments while at the same time providing a resource to look up deleted or removed comments? You see the problem here right?
<|endoftext|>I'd like to add to your write up one other weird piece of evidence. As we've not gotten an official response from the mods about Aleister.... [this image]( was included in a post over at top minds in the immediate aftermath of the Aleister removal. There is no confirmation of it being legit so far, but it fits the little pieces mods have unofficially dropped.If I follow correctly, the only way to have the ability to make that image, is as a mod of this subreddit, or an Admin. Its disturbing and raises a lot of questions I had hoped a mod would have an official response about.
<|endoftext|>u/IntellisaurDinoAlien deleted his account after u/Aleister replied to himself in modmail, leading to suspicions that he was another mod's alt. Or rather, he leaked the modmail where Aleister did it to TMoR and then deleted his account because he was frustrated that nobody was concerned about the possibility that a bunch of the /conspiracy mod accounts are run by one guy. The official statement by the mod team was that Aleistsr was drunk and made a mistake (fair enough), but they've since tried to retcon it as some sort of sting operation.But yeah, the mod vetting process here doesn't seem to be very succesful.
<|endoftext|>You've said it. Personally I would do it myself, but I don't want to get involved in modding just yet since I want to improve my skills first. Although I would like to measure myself in mod elections if they eventually happen!
<|endoftext|>To clarify, the SS is meant to demonstrate why OP thinks the post is suitable for /r/conspiracy.However, *there is no stated requirement that every single post has to have a uniquely identifiable and universally agreed upon conspiracy*.The logistics of enforcing such arbitrary and subjective conditions on the entire sub would cripple the mod team and devolve a good portion of the discussions into debates over whether a post is a "conspiracy theory" or not.The guidelines on the sidebar are a great place to start:This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the publics imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone.Try to keep this in mind: *This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues.* Censoring content based on whether or not something can be unanimously identified as a "conspiracy" (a nebulous concept) would be entirety antithetical to everything this sub stands for.
<|endoftext|>So would it be impossible for a mod to add a very brief mod-stamp basically agreeing that the post has an acceptable conspiracy as its focus?Also we need to shut down the repeats - we have 50 pipe bomb posts - thats ridiculous and highly counterproductive imho
<|endoftext|>Just sticking my nose in to repeat my theory that two very different conversations are happening here:1. There is a prepackaged and mod-approved discussion about how mods treat individual problem-users. This is essentially a question of reddiquette - most users ignore or downvote or move on from these encounters if they feel uncomfortable.2. There is a much more complex discussion that has to do with how mods might or ought to exercise whatever powers are at their disposal to return the sub to a state of balanced open minded discussion between redditors who genuinely want to talk about conspiracy theory. I cant determine why the first dominates and the second goes unaddressed.
<|endoftext|>That's the only way I can see this sub moving forward. Have the no meta rule and one meta thread per day/week for shit slinging. 
<|endoftext|>This sub has been a joke since the election. And it warrants the ostracism it receives.Then why are you here?Because i enjoyed the sub immensely prior to the extreme shift to one side of the political spectrum. Is there a rule prohibiting me from being here? Do i have to agree with the group think of one side of the other in order to participate here? There are clearly issues that users are commenting on and doing so in good faith. Why post a round table thread if there is no intent to discuss things?Im commenting in the hopes that just maybe there may be some modifications to the current status quo here as users make their feelings known, yet again.*the TOR node connection seems to be extremely interesting considering the sheer number of people who use reddit in a similar fashion and have never had an issue. A_P was suspended for multiple days, if memory serves at least 4 or 5 days, possibly more. Thats not a TOR issue, admins dont care about using TOR on the site, they do care about people vote manipulating running multiple accounts, doxxing, etc. 
<|endoftext|>Not disagreeing...but there's a dynamic in play that pretty much dictates how this is going to go.One group has to follow the rules...and one group doesn't...and this is enforced by the admins of reddit..it's not some whacked out conspiracy theory. It's a fact.And the interpretation of those rules is constantly being adjusted to favor the group that doesn't have to follow the rules.
<|endoftext|>Icy?I have nothing to be icy about. I've won and won and just when I thought I was about to lose the American people who had lost my confidence for being so easily manipulated proved me wrong. The sun came up and they flat rejected the political hit jobs and now fake ass mail bombs. Shit that just 4 or 5 years ago they would have guzzled down without question.The difference with the pendulum swing on this pass is that the MSM and deep state failed to secure control of the swing so they jumped off the ride.Look at us, we're the captain now.We can hear it coming. The low rumble growing in the bowels of the Patriots, we're about to take a huge shit on your parade.Enjoy.
<|endoftext|>Thank you very much for the honest answer to my questions. They were both more than expected and less than what is needed in this discussion:Do mods and those who influence and consult with them intentionally shape discussions where critical decisions or information are at stake?If any other players of any disposition chose to do that using such methods, would the mods be able to detect that manipulation and would they intervene to halt it?
<|endoftext|>I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/topmindsofreddit] [Toppest of Mods r\/Antacid\_Painintheass (getting closer every time) claims to be a political atheist which is an odd way to say Russian Shill]( you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
<|endoftext|>Being considered an employee would mean you'd be held to a higher standard for your moderation.Can't have employed mods banning inappropriately.You sure you want that? 
<|endoftext|>I was thinking more along the lines of new rules/new mods/new coexisting website. But good luck with that legal attack.
<|endoftext|>Im not advocating "backing down and running" I think the part were I said how millions of positive things have rippled through humanity because of reddit shows that. The problem is corporate influence/intelligence agency acronyms/private entities/trolls manipulating reddit and more specificly /r/conspiracy . The solution is not a simple one. I agree a new platform would face the same problems. The idea is they already own and control this one. Better to start fresh. And by no means do I want the new platform to overthrow reddit or /r/conspiracy the internet is big enough for them to coexist.
<|endoftext|>Why are mods responsible or in control?Mods are the first line of defense - they do not make the problems but they are the graspable mediators between users and those problems and their true source. It feels like were grasping at straws. due respectRespect is earned. You have earned a great deal of it with your vast patience, insight and acumen. So with due respect, why are you lending your talents to the manipulations and deceptions all of us can sense in the very bits being exchanged here? being nuked by the adminsIf the admins did that then a new and healthier branch of this tree would be able to reconstitute quickly. This is a flagship we dont want to lose but it isnt the heart of the matter. That core is the people - simply users - who are dedicated to lifting the curtain on secret and insidious operations of powerful players.
<|endoftext|>Dude, YOU posted that this was a false flag well before there was information and stickied it. You're kidding, right?
<|endoftext|>This is the problem exactly. Organic users will be discussing a conspiracy -- and not everyone necessarily believing it, but folks honestly, openly discussing the evidence and possible explanations -- and then a bunch of other folks come along and say, nope, not a conspiracy, debunked, etc. Any attempt to discuss the fact that they won't even acknowledge a conspiracy theory is a *possibility* or that their comments and downvote patterns appear inorganic, is met with the retort that "why is anyone who disagrees with you automatically a shill?" This happens very frequently on certain topics. On a conspiracy forum, I have no problem with people saying "I'm not convinced" or "I'm skeptical" but this obvious, repeated pattern of complete denial followed by mass downvotes and whining about shill accusations needs to be dealt with. 
<|endoftext|>Regarding your first point, I think if people want 100% unfiltered discussion they are free to go to VOAT. I would prefer curated content here to maximize waking people up. I think it's easy to set logical lines. For example, you can say Zionism is bad, but you can't say judiasm is bad. Regarding the second point, I am a little confused. Do you believe we live in a democracy?
<|endoftext|>We don't have to even get along but we don't have to be shitty to each other either.Fingers crossed*
<|endoftext|>x,y are points in time for users A and B respectively. Linear regression and reporting of R^2 would be great. Then do this for all combinations of users and report where R^2 is 0.75. As I write this, it sounds like a lot of work.
<|endoftext|> Probably for editing their comments after being banned or for spamming.This was definitely the case for DwarvesAreForCuddles. I think I remember poor Celine having to go through and spend a solid chunk of time removing all of their posts. (There were a LOT.)
<|endoftext|>How do I allow users to see the mod log? I'm probably the worst mod on the team to ask. You may want to hit up mod mail with that question, and mention I said so. Have a good one!
<|endoftext|>That's definitely part of it, but there is more to it than that. I used to whine about the conclave a lot so one of the mods ended up adding me as a member. The sub is dead. There are hardly any new posts there and even when there are the mods usually don't respond to anything. I agree that there seems to be a bit of a "Good ol boys" club, but the conclave is a very, very small part of it. 
<|endoftext|>You just sound butthurt because you have been shitting where we eat all these years, and they picked PLC over you to represent the trollish contingent of regulars.
<|endoftext|>He's one of the specific ones I was thinking of, but I didn't want to name any names. There were some leaked screenshots from the conclave back around the time the new mods were added where he outright admitted to intentionally trolling and trying to break the rules in clever ways (like calling someone "rabbi" instead of "jew", or saying "brrr it's chilly" instead of "shill").There are a few other users as well, including one who also moderates a lot of the same subs as mods here. He even tried to become a mod here but had a temper tantrum when he didn't get it. I believe that's what got him banned, but he was just recently unbanned. If he ends up getting added as a mod now that there are openings, we'll know why. 
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the response! I think your reasons are fine, I just have the feeling that we might disagree on who those descriptions apply to. There are some users who seem to spend more time trolling than posting (or debunking) conspiracies. The kind of users who intentionally post controversial topics just to bait people into arguing with them. The kind of users who will post borderline racist comments one day and then go around accusing everyone else of being racists the next day, just to stir up drama. 
<|endoftext|>We know people commit crimes. We know people have friends and allies. Yet saying people planned crimes in secret is somehow impossible. That's the level of cognitive dissonance in this country, a criminal charge you could literally go to jail for is considered fantasy. The idea that anyone in power would abuse that power is paranoia? I don't think so.
<|endoftext|>Im way too lazy for that but going forward I will. They are all removed now. So please explain how conspiracy gets around this term and condition? As far as this goes - the modlog just shows a comment was approved/removed. It doesn't link their username to anything.How does this sub give redditors the chance to change or remove their comments while at the same time providing a resource to look up deleted or removed comments? How does any subreddit?You see the problem here right?Not really.
<|endoftext|>As we've not gotten an official responseIt's my understanding that we're still waiting for some clarification from the admins before making an "official" announcement.Perhaps someone else on the team with a better sense of the timeline can chime in here, but it's my understanding that aleister approved a post that linked to an image that contained Blasey Ford's address, as stated in the screenshotted message.FTR, doxxing is not even remotely tolerated on /r/conspiracy and we take this issue *very* seriously. At the time, aleister was doing the lion's share of the moderation duties, and tbh I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt that of the hundreds of posts he was moderating on a daily basis that he approved this one by mistake.As it was, to my knowledge, his first infraction, I did petition the admins to restore his account with a warning, but as the severity of this issue is indisputable, I won't be holding my breath, and I certainly don't fault the admins for not budging.Ultimately, as this sub continues to grow, we're going to need to bulk up the mod team so we can make sure every post and comment here follow the sub's--and reddit's--rules.
<|endoftext|>I'd say pretty good, considering we offer a modlog of all of our actions. Could you imagine if a sub this large, with groups who are out to get it, offered the same?
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the clarification! I've always thought the following justified the need for a statement in regards to *why* it belongs in the conspiracy sub:Should explain or elaborate on why the link is being posted to /r/conspiracy and why the userbase should care about it.Regardless, it's helpful to have a mod chime in!
<|endoftext|>Thanks! So let me repeat back what Im picking up:The SS forces the OP to justify the content of their post as suitable for conspiracyThe mod is tasked with ensuring each post has a SSHowever, while checking the SS the mod cannot undertake the additional suitability that the post is about a reasonably valid conspiracy bacause1. It would be too onerous,And 2. It might interfere with free thinking Do I have it right?
<|endoftext|>Regarding 2 - I agree it is very complex.I'm hoping when this thread is done we rework all the Rules on the sidebar, elminate some and consolidate some others.
<|endoftext|>I think the [Meta] theads will eventually consolidate themselves and their frequency will dip over time (but should always be available).And this way users can toggle to hide those so only those who care will see them - improving the page for those users immediately.
<|endoftext|>Because i enjoyed the sub immensely prior to the extreme shift to one side of the political spectrum. Is there a rule prohibiting me from being here? Do i have to agree with the group think of one side of the other in order to participate here? No.There are clearly issues that users are commenting on and doing so in good faith. Why post a round table thread if there is no intent to discuss things?240 comments so far with 4 mods that I saw. Seems to be a solid discussion.Im commenting in the hopes that just maybe there may be some modifications to the current status quo here as users make their feelings known, yet again.Me too.*the TOR node connection seems to be extremely interesting considering the sheer number of people who use reddit in a similar fashion and have never had an issue. Do you oversee these reports with reddit? How are you privy to this kind of information? I'd love to see it.
<|endoftext|>Look at us, we're the captain **for now.**We can hear it coming. The low rumble growing in the bowels of the Patriots, we're about to take a huge shit on **everyones** parade.**FTFY** Enjoy.
<|endoftext|>Do mods and those who influence and consult with them intentionally shape discussions where critical decisions or information are at stake?Not that I am aware of.If any other players of any disposition chose to do that using such methods, would the mods be able to detect that manipulation and would they intervene to halt it?Not sure what you mean. Do you think we're spooks? How could we possibly do anything like that?
<|endoftext|>Being considered an employee would mean you'd be held to a higher standard for your moderation.Can't have employed mods banning inappropriately.Yeah, it probably would be a good idea. It would be nice to know someone who held power over my actions at least had some kind of background check... You sure you want that? Haha, this isn't about what I want. It's literally the federal labor laws they are in violation of. I didn't make the laws, nor did I create reddit's business model. So once again, a for-profit company can't permit volunteers to work for them. It's really that simple, and the amount of Stockholm syndrome surrounding it is baffling. Edit: I mean, as you u/rockran pointed out, wouldn't it be nice to get me fired?Rockran 7 points 8 days ago* edit: banuser by kit86423 minutes agoother: Rule 5 3 days RockranPetition to fire a mod? It's hard enough to get rid of bad mods, if they're employed it becomes a great deal more difficult. Otherwise they could sue for unfair dismissal.[Source](
<|endoftext|>I still believe there is a special middle road that goes through the sub. We are negotiating the unwinding of our parents and grandparents secrets and mistakes, like jfk and Vietnam, and gwb and ghwb and their wars. Its not about mere politics, its a way of penance and respect as well as fully informing the next generation
<|endoftext|> It feels like were grasping at straws.I don't blame you. Honestly, the mod team has very similar frustrations with respect to our relationship with the admins.Sometimes they are there when we *really* need them...and, well, sometimes they very noticeably aren't.Again, I don't fault them, as I'm sure they have a monstrously difficult job, but it often leaves us high and dry and as a result much of the discontent gets directed at *us* when TBH it should be directed up the food chain.why are you lending your talents to the manipulations and deceptions all of us can sense in the very bits being exchanged here?That's a really good question that I've been struggling with for quite a number of years now.One of the things that *got* me elected mod in the first place was my dedication to producing original content solely for the benefit of /r/conspiracy. I'm really proud of some of the material I've put together over the last decade or so.However, when I became mod, I found myself occupied with moderation duties much more resulting in less time for this research.You're right...I should lead by example.As an aside, I'm finally putting the finishing touches on the next installment in my "research" and I should be posting it soon! (Spoiler Alert: It concerns a mysterious prisoner and an even more mysterious flight during WWII)If the admins did that then a new and healthier branch of this tree would be able to reconstitute quickly. This is a flagship we dont want to lose but it isnt the heart of the matter. That core is the people - simply users - who are dedicated to lifting the curtain on secret and insidious operations of powerful players.You're probably right about this, and I commend your optimism!
<|endoftext|> YOU posted that this was a false flag well before there was informationPlease don't spread fake news. I quite literally said anything was possible and even predicted it could be a crazed right-winger.You're kidding, right?Aren't you?
<|endoftext|>Why can't I say Judaism is bad when people say Christianity is bad and Islam is bad?We live in a democratic republic. On the state level it's a representative direct democracy (for most states) and on the federal level it's a republic.
<|endoftext|>I'm sure 4 of those are for arguing with a certain someone who likes to brag about his bans.Which is like bragging about getting detentions. "Wow, it's so cool you can't follow rules..."
<|endoftext|>Yup, you've fairly accurately summarized the general clusterfuck that is moderating a sub like /r/conspiracy =D
<|endoftext|>As far as this goes - the modlog just shows a comment was approved/removed. It doesn't link their username to anything.Are you saying the mod log doesn't show the name of the user who had their comment removed/approved/etc? It does name the commenter and the mod who took the action.
<|endoftext|>Ultimately, as this sub continues to grow, we're going to need to bulk up the mod team so we can make sure every post and comment here follow the sub's--and reddit's--rules.Will new mods be chosen by the larger sub or will they also be chosen in conspiracy_conclave like the last group? Will the nomination/selection process be transparent, or will it all take place in a private sub again?
<|endoftext|>Thanks! I feel that would be/would have been a great response to issue to the community. ---Since my observation seems to keep getting sidestepped I'll ask my question directly:Is it possible there is a mod in conspiracy who is passing nonpublic information on to the users at top minds? I ask because the screenshot I posted in a earlier reply seems to imply that they have screenshots from a mod/admin thread. Is there another way for that info to be revealed? 
<|endoftext|>Indicating that youve visited TopMinds is enough to be banned here. I don't agree based on personal experience. 
<|endoftext|>Since I think you are the only mod in this thread so far could you comment about how you ensure the mods who work here are held accountable for approves, removes, bans mutes etc?I posted several links to your mod log, which is wonderful, showing more than a few abuses. How does this sub handle a mod who is acting out or not performing their duties correctly?
<|endoftext|>The SS forces the OP to justify the content of their post as suitable for conspiracyYes, but it also eliminates posts from bots, spam and low-effort content from those with minimal interest in the sub.The mod is tasked with ensuring each post has a SSWe have a bot that removes the thread if OP doesn't post a comment after 20 minutes.When folks abuse the SS it almost always gets reported by the users, and at that point the mods can deal with it directly.In these instances, the mods can use their own judgment to determine whether or not OP is posting in good faith.If the SS is simply something like: "this is fascinating, check it out!!" I will issue a warning to that user, explain the purpose of the SS, and usually that's that.It really just needs to give a respectable summary of the content being presented to the community.At most the SS is an inconvenient extra step to help ensure the "humanity" and integrity of OP.
<|endoftext|> 240 comments so far with 4 mods that I saw. Seems to be a solid discussion.there have been similar discussions in the past and nothing changed. I wont hold my breath on this resulting in anything meaningful either.I wont hold
<|endoftext|>That's the problem with your platform, you guys think you can define what everyone is actually saying.Trump says he's a nationalist and the MSM says he really meant "white nationalist".Nobody gives a shit about your ftfy nonsense anymore. Obviously my original message wasn't intended for you although you're welcome to join minds.com and gab.ai, they won't ban you for being a leftist. But we all know that you'll be more comfortable where the information monitors roam the halls mopping away all the wrong think and banning all the conservatives, nationalist and Patriots.
<|endoftext|>How indeed.With your conspiratards and your c_s_ts and tmors and conclaves, your offshores in chans and voats ... your corporate masters and political thralldomsThis web is a veritable model of a digital instance of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny - spook theorists mimicking spook realities in the relative safety of a new cyber-universe where we are the known unknowns.
<|endoftext|>Not really.I don't like being shoed into labels because then people will assume you carry ALL the traits. I like some bits. 
<|endoftext|>I get what you are saying. The context of this specific view is that we are already post-freespeech in this forum because of manipulation from TMOR and other groups. It is close to impossible in this forums current state for quality posts to get a spotlight. That is why I would shift into curated content. The goal would not be to respect everyone's view but to promote the most thorough, informative content.Now, I admit this is all a little egocentric because I consider myself to be a top theorist globally and think I would be able to shift this forum into being the premier and best organized truth repository on the net, and wouldn't really trust anyone else to do it (that being said, shout-out to our top mods whom i support).So to respond to your specific inquiry I would say, you can criticize religion in general. But if someone is constantly criticising judiasm but not the jesuits, for example, then I would call them out on having an incomplete worldview and tell them to inform themselves more.
<|endoftext|>Yes - if implemented you would be able to filter out certain topics (or only see them) I think.If it can be done - I would want it this way for sure.
<|endoftext|>Oh good catch. And sidenote, I really do find your analyses fascinating. Thanks for sticking around and giving insight into this stuff!
<|endoftext|>So I went digging thru my old saved links and I found the archive of when he admitted to trying to break the rules. relevant quote from about halfway down the page:What compelled me to return to con was flytapes constant bitching about how dead it was. When I was "trolling" I was experimenting with the limits of this now unfamiliar sub. After a long thread in the inside many months ago I got the idea to attack rule ten. I went around posting very controversial subjects, the main one being that the Nazi Party was inspired by left wing totalitarianism. When tmor instantly attacked the posts i was able to label the attackers tmor, or chilly, or any other veiled name for shill. I wanted to protest rule ten by going around it. Needless to say a nameless mod really didn't like this. So hammer. I think the ban your talking about was from a thread about the health risks of anal sex, someone posted that they had their girlfriend on a leash or something like that. And I said something like have fun when she leaves you for Tyrone. Which was meant to be a joke but admittedly in bad taste. Everyone's personal fetish is their business. God knows we all have them..I think humor is the most important weapon in breaking down cognitive dissonance. Many of my posts are (yes I tell myself this) a complex form of satire that my post, Confessions of a Monarchist Pagan, outline. To some my humor may be trolling, but to me conspiracy would be dead if we couldn't have a laugh.
<|endoftext|>Unfortunately, your comment contains images that violate reddit's [TOS]( negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; orIt will be reinstated when you scratch out the usernames.
<|endoftext|>Why do you want users calling each other delusional? I thought we werent supposed to call each other names? Check the mod log people get removed for name calling constantly. 
<|endoftext|>Maybe the mods can do an open enrollment period where people can request admittance to the conclave and be vetted. Then the election can be held there without bot, shill and brigade interference. Voter registration as it were. 
<|endoftext|>/u/Th3_Admiral has a [nice suggestion]( could just have public voting. Don't base it on upvotes and downvotes, but by public comments. Every vote is directly tied to a username. Then you either use automod or some other tool to ignore new accounts, accounts that have never posted here before, or whatever other system you can come up with. It'd be pretty hard to manipulate that except for someone who has a bunch of well-used alt accounts standing by.
<|endoftext|>Is it possible there is a mod in conspiracy who is passing nonpublic information on to the users at top minds?From my understanding, a mod shared the screenshot with the "conclave" sub and it leaked from there. It's long been known that someone in the conclave leaks to TMOR, so nothing truly sensitive is shared there anyway.I wasn't personally involved in any of that so I can't really say much more.
<|endoftext|>could you comment about how you ensure the mods who work here are held accountable for approves, removes, bans mutes etc?Sure! I personally don't feel it's my responsibility as an individual to explain other mods actions. I may disagree with some of them, and even offer my point of view in mod mail. But that doesn't mean I can explain their personal point of view on their actions. With that said, the issue isn't with the mods per say, but the way Reddit has structured how they allow mods to manage users content. It's been an issue since day one and have personally spoken out against it. How does this sub handle a mod who is acting out or **not performing their duties correctly**?And this is the question that brought me to realize reddit is out of compliance with federal and state labor laws. Reddit, as a for-profit company, enlists "Volenteers" (according to them) to manage the subs. This creates the issue, since if you look at the laws for Volenteers, non-profits are limited to how they can manage the people who volunteer for them... reddit is in a gray area, since they are breaking the law and no one has called them on their bullshit... yet.
<|endoftext|>Thank you for your patience and the steady way you work and explain. It will not help my urge to reclaim a subreddit I remember when nearly every post was interesting and topical, I know
<|endoftext|>"information monitors roam the halls mopping away all the wrong think and banning..."You mean like they do over at r/thedonald? Hypocrite much?
<|endoftext|>So do you think going one going all means tossing the women and children and the stokers and the stewards off the deck? We all count. Thats the human position.
<|endoftext|>With your conspiratards and your c_s_ts and tmors and conclaves, your offshores in chans and voats ... your corporate masters and political thralldomsI don't chan or voat and don't really conclave. What you see is what you get.This web is a veritable model of a digital instance of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny - spook theorists mimicking spook realities in the relative safety of a new cyber-universe where we are the known unknowns.I'm sure some movements or groups have congealed in the places you mention and are organizing. At this point I am of the belief that they use /r/conspiracy as a battleground of sorts and we are all spectators (and sometimes the focus of the Show, unfortunately).
<|endoftext|>don't tag my nameI won't anymore, but I hope you recognize I couldn't give a fuck less at this point. 
<|endoftext|>We really don't need any more bullshitters and cruel trolling remarks on here, so good riddance (hopefully)
<|endoftext|>So that means you'd need to consider banning all archive links. As they are likely to contain content that has since been edited or deleted. And you'd need to remove the mod log as that now is hosting the content which you removed for TOS violations. 
<|endoftext|>Why do you want users calling each other delusional? I don't. Neither did that comment. Read it again.I thought we werent supposed to call each other names? Check the mod log people get removed for name calling constantly. That comment specifically did not. Read it again.You are also going to need to edit your comment above and remove all usernames per reddit's [Terms of Service]( may **not**:Intentionally negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; orYour unredacted screenshots each violate this and can jeapordize your account as well as the Subreddit as a whole.One hour should be enough time. If they remain as is any comments by you in this thread in a similar manner will be removed.
<|endoftext|>Are we talking about the mod log in general? I'm referring to what we, as users, can see when we open the mod log link. You can see the user, the content of the comment/post, and the mod that took the action.
<|endoftext|> where people can request admittance to the conclave and be vetted.This is basically already the process for anyone who wants to join the conclave and as far as I understand it, the second to last wave of moderators was done exactly like this but public even (done on this sub and not a private one).
<|endoftext|>It'd be pretty hard to manipulate that except for someone who has a bunch of well-used alt accounts standing by.Like when the sub announced the implementation of the minimum age account rule to participate and suddenly multiple perfectly aged accounts appeared within the following day?or how we have that rule but certain sub mods will manually approve account posts/comments for accounts that are below the threshold?
<|endoftext|>With that said, the issue isn't with the mods per say, but the way Reddit has structured how they allow mods to manage users content.So as of right now there is no accountability once a person has been granted mod status? They can basically run wild?Lets say you have a mod who is ban happy and dramatically overstepping their duties at what point do the other mods step in, how does that process work and have you ever seen it in action? This creates the issue, since if you look at the laws for Volenteers, non-profits are limited to how they can manage the people who volunteer for them... reddit is in a gray area, since they are breaking the law and no one has called them on their bullshit... yet.I would actually be curious to see this as its own post. 
<|endoftext|>my urge to reclaim a subreddit I remember when nearly every post was interesting and topicalIt seems to me that you are more longing for a different era of the *internet* than /r/conspiracy. There is a literal generational shift occurring before our very eyes, and it's had a noticeable impact on the content and atmosphere of reddit as a whole, and it's been quite the ride, as you clearly can attest to.The clickbaitization of the internet (and real life!) started to take its worst toll on /r/conspiracy around this time last year. If you recall, the sub was flooded with absolute drivel, and it was relentless. tbh, although the mod team had some reservations about being overly restrictive, the eventual implementation of the submission statement and the minimum 2-month requirement for accounts has significantly cleaned up the board, and I actually feel like we're closer than ever to the feel of /r/conspiracy from around 5 or 6 years ago.Granted, there's much more political content, but that's largely due to how many political conspiracy theories have now gone mainstream.
<|endoftext|>Like you do following me all over Reddit downvoting and complaining about my opinions.Seriously everyone look at this guys comment history. Everywhere I comment on Reddit Zir shows up and whines about whatever I'm saying. This is why Reddit will die, fucking opinion management teams like this correcting the record.
<|endoftext|>Yes we all count, that's the human position. I agree 100%.This is exactly why venues like Reddit and YouTube are dying. That's why I said what I said above. You you care about fairness and everyone counting then there are better venues that aren't hell bent on deplatforming conservatives, blaming white people for everything and using collective punishment to gloss over certain people's civil rights.3 or 4 years ago, before the left needed the Russia conspiracy to explain away their unpopularity, that was /conspiracy on Reddit. Conspiracy was constantly being collectively punished, the butt of every joke. Even the admins mocked us openly but now you can honestly have this place. We used it for many years to spread the truth and we have turned the culture war in our favor. Nobody trusts the FBI, CIA or MSM. And that's how it should be since these three letter agencies decided to use their various powers to prop up the ruling elites instead serving the people. There is only so much you can lie to people before they look at your latest bomb hoax story and change the channel without even considering it. "By any means necessary" they said... And we answered "actually, go fuck yourselves.". And we changed the channel. No need to reply with another subject change like you just attempted, I said my piece in the original comment I made here and I have no obligation to answer a stack of loaded questions.
<|endoftext|>Not a file, it's in my saved comments on Reddit along with a few other things I refer back to occasionally. Like the "persona non grata" list you guys put together a [while back]( Now that I'm looking at it again, I notice that /u/f_k_a_g_n even made it on that list, which is really shocking. That's the user who has provided a lot of really good analysis on suspicious accounts, posting histories, and stuff like that.Edit: Here's the actual comment I had saved in case you are curious. It's from the announcement thread for the new mods.
<|endoftext|>Creepier even more that you comment to yourselves when youre the same person.Can I get banned for that? Even if my guess is true?
<|endoftext|>And if they ever want to edit or delete them, they can.The **content** of their *comment* is what we are talking about.
<|endoftext|> Your unredacted screenshots each violate this and can jeapordize your account as well as the Subreddit as a whole.So let me get this straight, making reference of the modlog violates the terms of service for reddit as a whole? I am not allowed to reference the mod log on reddit itself? One hour should be enough time. If they remain as is any comments by you in this thread in a similar manner will be removed.So you are going to remove all of my comments in this thread? 
<|endoftext|>If you take a screenshot of a user's content, and the name is not redacted, it violates reddit's TOS.
<|endoftext|> Pretty much anyone who asks is let inNot true. At the very least, you have to have an established record of participation in /r/conspiracy.
<|endoftext|>Which is one of the reasons (IMO), *it's a failed idea, now*. People should have to earn their way in (via contributions over time), and that was case the for the original approved submitters. And, just so people know, no... I'm no longer a member there, nor have I for a while.
<|endoftext|>Like when the sub announced the implementation of the minimum age account rule to participate and suddenly multiple perfectly aged accounts appeared within the following day?I'm actually not quite sure I follow...From the mod's perspectives, when we established the two month rule it was *two months* later that we all of the sudden had to deal with an influx of 2-month old accounts.Since then, things have pretty much leveled out.I think this minimum account age requirement has done wonders to clean this place up.
<|endoftext|>I would actually be curious to see this as its own post. can also follow this TMOR thread, it's pretty funny.
<|endoftext|>Again, and as always, you make perfect sense.But only in respect to trends and audience. You must see that much much less conspiracy is being discussed than in years past. And the younger users are being encouraged in their ignorance to start from scratch rather than educating themselves.New eyes and more clicks - is that really the underlying goal? Are we monetizing this damn thing called conspiracy, or are we fighting for our country and our planet to survive as a place we would want for the futures we see coming at us?
<|endoftext|>Dude, relax, don't get hysterical. This is a public forum. You are free to post your opinions, and I am free to call out your bullshit and hypocracy. If you can't handle heat, you can always go back to r/thedonald where the thought police roam the halls banning everyone who doesn't tow the fascist line worshiping the "GEOTUS".
<|endoftext|>That's the comment! And if I was trying to end the dispute I would have perm banned them an deleted the comments. I don't appreciate anyone taking one comment out of context to smear me, you or any other user. And it was a slap on the wrist frankly. The fact you are even taking issue with it is surprising.
<|endoftext|> Your unredacted screenshots each violate this and can jeapordize your account as well as the Subreddit as a whole.So let me get this straight, making reference of the modlog violates the terms of service for reddit as a whole? Read my comment above again. I did not stutter.I am not allowed to reference the mod log on reddit itself? Read my comment again. I did not stutter.One hour should be enough time. If they remain as is any comments by you in this thread in a similar manner will be removed.So you are going to remove all of my comments in this thread? Any that have screenshots that violate reddit's TOS - yes. You have twenty minutes, BTW.
<|endoftext|>Unfortunately, your comment contains images that violate reddit's [TOS]( negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; orYou have been adequately warnes and continue to do this. That is unfortunate.
<|endoftext|>I know you think you're being clever (you're not), but Puzzleheaded is just [one of the words used]( in Reddit's autogenerated username system.(For those not in the loop, RMFN thinks I'm former user PuzzleheadedBiscotti simply because everyone knows all accounts with the same word in them are owned by the same person.)
<|endoftext|>[lol.](
<|endoftext|>it was not two months later. I reported them when i saw them, sure there was an increased influx later.But you are neglecting to respond about the approval of accounts actions that DONT meet the age requirement.
<|endoftext|>Are we monetizing this damn thing called conspiracyNot on our watch! I personally think the reason the /r/conspiracy mod team is attacked so frequently is precisely because we've shown that we *can't* be bought.In addition, we are all individuals who have our own unique perspectives and personalities. You must see that much much less conspiracy is being discussed than in years past. Yes, that's why I've implemented the Round Table feature, as well as the SS which *somewhat* requires OP to stay in the realm of "conspiracy" theory.
<|endoftext|>Well did anything come out of this round table?Other than mods stickying their own posts to try something new to combat brigading?
<|endoftext|>So why do you follow me around all over Reddit? Just be honest no need to pretend like you're not doing it intentionally.
<|endoftext|>Did you or did you not ever ask to be let in?You can't get invited into a sub and reject that invitation and go back and talk like you were excluded. It's pretty pathetic honestly. 
<|endoftext|>Would you care to address the actual quote, or are you more concerned with the fact I saved a link to it? 
<|endoftext|>Never mind I must have mistaken you for a different person with the same user name? Do you think thats just a coincidence?
<|endoftext|>Honestly I think this is just bullshit to keep users from posting screenshots. If you actually cared about that rule you wouldnt link to the mod logJust saying
<|endoftext|> Any that have screenshots that violate reddit's TOS - yes.How does this subreddit get around that rule?Since you brought it up... Isnt conspiracy breaking this very rule by linking to deleted comments via the modlog? Intentionally negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the ServicesHave you run this one by the admins? I only found that log because of the mod team here and their links to it. So please explain how I violate it by posting snippets of what is provided. 
<|endoftext|>While not required, you are requested to use the NP (No Participation) domain of reddit when crossposting. This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans. The NP domain can be accessed by replacing the "www" in your reddit link with "np".*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/conspiracy) if you have any questions or concerns.*
<|endoftext|>But you are neglecting to respond about the approval of accounts actions that DONT meet the age requirement.Which instances are you referring to?When I browse through popular threads on /r/conspiracy, I frequently see and approve comments from newer users, especially if they are constructive.Similarly, I always approve comments from shadowbanned users when I see them, and I then will inform them of their predicament.New users that want to *continue* to post conspiratorial content generally have to "do their time" at /r/conspiracy_commons first.
<|endoftext|>Thank you! Out of curiosity, why did my comment/comments make you think of it? No worries if you don't feel like sharing. Have a good evening!
<|endoftext|>Sure, I agree with one. Still stand by my 3 day ban. And if you see someone pull the same shit, let me know. I couldn't care less about anyones point of view here. But if you're going to mischaracterize what one user said in order to smear them, then I'll ban that user. Don't play games! 
<|endoftext|>Why should I explain myself when everything is all out in the open? You have already laid out your conspiracy theory. Thet just about covered it.If you're the kind of person that gets hung up on a out of context comment from well over a year ago then you're probably perfect for the community. We always welcome anyone skilled at hermeutics. 
<|endoftext|> Similarly, I always approve comments from shadowbanned users when I see them, and I then will inform them of their predicament.Could you clarify why you do this? You frequently criticize the admins for not properly moderating this website, but on the rare occasion that they do take action on something you actively undermine them. You rightfully criticize the admins for not taking action on hostile sub members using alts to bypass your bans, but the entire point of a shadowban is to keep the recipient in the dark so they don't make an alt, right?You don't seem to actually base it off the quality of their post since I've seen more than one occasion where you [approve comments from obvious spambots posting suspicious links that have nothing to do with the topic]( so I'd like to hear your thought process behind this.
<|endoftext|>Don't you find it somewhat ironic that the "transparency mission" of this sub now means there are at least two offshoot subs where users have to "prove themselves" and then another tier for users who have "proven themselves"?Like, there are shills on reddit, that's a given, so your reaction with these sister subs, while ostensibly appearing to crack down on shills, really only has the effect of making it more difficult for legitimate new users to join the discussion.If paid actors are being used to infiltrate/slide discussions, they wouldn't have a problem either 1)paying for aged accounts 2)playing along for the 2 or 3 months to get "in".The whole setup just seems counter intuitive to the free flow of information in my opinion. 
<|endoftext|>Wait so everyone can pull up the mod log and look at the names directly, but if anyone takes a screenshot of the thing were all already looking at, its a violation? Why? Its the same information that you already make publicly available... 
<|endoftext|>Shadowbanning is an extremely controversial practice, and you'd be hard pressed to find *anyone* on /r/conspiracy that truly thinks shadowbanning is anything but a sketchy and underhanded way to deal with users that ostensibly break the rules.Some folks have commented for *years* without knowing they're shadowbanned, and tbh that's fucked up.but on the rare occasion that they do take actionThe admins take action on stuff *all the time*...shadowbanning is one of many things they do, but it's definitely one of the most unscrupulous and unfair.but the entire point of a shadowban is to keep the recipient in the dark.Is it? Shadowbanning is done based off the user's IP address, so creating alts isn't possible without masking it (which ban evaders would do anyway).Shadowbanning as it exists now is simply lazy moderation. I'm of the opinion that the admins should extend the courtesy to these individuals of at least informing them that they've been banned.Also, you are assuming that the admins are *infallible* when they choose to shadowban. They're not.you actively undermine them.Undermining them would be reversing the shadowban (which I can't do) or approving content that breaks the rules of reddit (which I don't do).I don't see any problem with approving these comments and extending this courtesy to these individuals. In fact, I'm often lauded for doing so. This is the first time anyone has ever raised concerns over this practice (which I appreciate and it's why I'm addressing your concerns!).where you approve comments from obvious spambots You've posted the archive link on this...I checked the actual thread and my comment isn't even there and that user's comment has been removed.This was about a month ago...it looks like I mistakenly approved their comment and then when I followed the link and realized it was spam I deleted my comment.I've seen more than one occasionWhat's the other occasion? This one doesn't really count because I fixed the mistake right away.I'm *extremely* careful in the current environment to never approve anything that breaks reddit's TOS.AFAIK, the reddit admins have no stated policy on the approval of comments from shadowbanned users, and TBH, as long as they follow the rules, I really don't think they even care.
<|endoftext|>Maybe! I haven't seen any... Maybe some minimum wage would be nice for some of these mods.... I'll be straight up with you! The amount of shit/work these guys do is a full time job... And I don't Include myself in that category. When I see back biters harassing them, my anger goes to a full on for-profit company that is owned by the 4th largest conglomerate in NY in 2012 (Advance Publications):[ Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012.](
<|endoftext|>Wait so everyone can pull up the mod log and look at the names directly, Nothing wrong with that.but if anyone takes a screenshot of the thing were all already looking at, its a violation? It is when you screenshot the comment with the username attached. The modlog doesn't disclose anything about any contribution a user may have made. Just that they did something, and then *we* did something. Do you see the difference?Why? Because they are different. I hope I cleared it up for you above.Its the same information that you already make publicly available... No, it's not.
<|endoftext|>Can you disprove any of them?Im not gonna waste my time to go dig through my saved history and share them when you and people like you on mod team will either ignore it or use it for some nefarious action like banning me for criticizing the sub. The new mod additions were done out of site and extremely suspect. Theres one right there. And over time the sub has become extremely political and over represents the castoffs of certain banned subs. You have yet to ban the account that posts the same mein kempf post multiples in a day and every few days. How about just that to start? 
<|endoftext|>How could a screenshot of a mod log disclose *more* info than the log itself? Thats impossible... 
<|endoftext|>Can you disprove any of them?Not how this works. Im not gonna waste my time to go dig through my saved history and share them when you and people like you on mod team will either ignore it or use it for some nefarious action like banning me for criticizing the sub. I move to dismiss based on lack of evidence.The new mod additions were done out of site and extremely suspect. Theres one right there. Mods were added in a way we saw fit. Some were great. Others light shined too bright. If you're going to criticise me for not nailing the entirety of last year's draft class, I'll accept the blame. But the good news is this year's class is looking great, too.And over time the sub has become extremely political and over represents the castoffs of certain banned subs. So because we don't ban them too? Just start reporting the accounts you don't like and I'll be sure to take care of it for ya. Give me a break.You have yet to ban the account that posts the same mein kempf post multiples in a day and every few days. Use the report feature. How about just that to start? So far so good.
<|endoftext|>Fine well keep it simple to help not waste time on more condescending snark. I personally have reported that users and their mein kempf spam posts multiple times. Yet they are still allowed to persist. Meanwhile users with way less of an agenda are banned for single comments. How are the reports concerning the blatant spam posts allowed to continue?
<|endoftext|>Hey JCP, different dude here reading up on this thread. Are the comments in the screenshots different than the ones in the modlog? Just curious. 
<|endoftext|>Fine well keep it simple to help not waste time on more condescending snark. I'm not wasting time. I'm workin'. In more ways than one.I personally have reported that users and their mein kempf spam posts multiple times.What rule does it break? Did it ever occur to you that it was actually not against the rules? Again - it's tough for me to make a ruling without you being able to link it.Yet they are still allowed to persist. Meanwhile users with way less of an agenda are banned for single comments. How are the reports concerning the blatant spam posts allowed to continue?Perhaps they aren't that blatant?
<|endoftext|>The act of a user screenshotting a user's comment without redacting their name is against reddit's TOS linked in this thread.Pointing to the modlog is immaterial as the the modlog is not a user, but a reddit-based service, and a dead end.

<|endoftext|>A book that really broke this concept open for me was Lynn Mctaggart's, "The Field". really blew my mind. She gets into the P.E.A.R research at Stanford utilizing the manipulation of a random event generator by people.This also leads into the topic of consciousness research through the installation of REG machines around the world, recording data 24/7 and correlating to events the world pays attention to. The research is honestly incredible to look into.Global Consciousness Project - 
<|endoftext|>I've been hacking away at the book [Real Magic]( and it examines many phenomena from a scientific perspective. It starts to examine the history and suppression of beliefs in Magic, and concludes with the findings of experiments that have been done to study it. While we are likely not able to fly, teleport or move things with our mind, it is very possible that we are able to connect with the universe at a conscious level and influence it to some degree. 
<|endoftext|>It can't all be bullshit, the CIA and project Stargate, I mean the government payed thousands of taxpayer dollars to research this stuff; Astral projection, remote viewing ect. Part and parcel of reaching to obtain "full spectrum dominance".
<|endoftext|>Wow, really pumped this was the selection! My whole goal with sharing that video around here lately was just so that as many people as possible could hear about Chang and from there allow a discussion to occur, which we just got!Let me give some additional context on the topic from a more scientific point of view: *(Thanks to some dedicated researchers for putting this together)*______________________________________________________________ researchers included:Gregory V. Simpson, Ph.D. is a neuroscientist, formerly the Director of the Dynamic Neuroimaging Laboratory at UCSF, Co-Director, Dynamic Brain Activity Imaging Laboratory at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a Senior Scientist at the Brain Plasticity Institute.Also present were a Medical Doctor and the head of the Mind Science Foundation.The subject was stripped to his underwear, and an undershirt and searched with a metal detector. He then gave a demonstration inside his home. After that, he gave another demonstration outside his home. Then the researchers took him to a random location they chose for a final demonstration.Some things to keep in mind John never charged any patient, or student anything. He also did not accept donations of any kind. After this video aired he retired and left his top student in charge.More importantly than that, this isn't a faith based practice. Students are able to practice and see directly for themselves.______________________________________________________________________A more well studied practice, known as Tummo and practiced by Tibetan buddhists, is quite similar to the foundations of Chang's practice. visits to remote monasteries in the 1980s, Benson and his team studied monks living in the Himalayan Mountains who could, by g Tum-mo meditation, raise the temperatures of their fingers and toes by as much as 17 degrees. It has yet to be determined how the monks are able to generate such heat."Dr. Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical, also published in the journal nature. researchers collected data during the unique ceremony in Tibet, where nuns were able to raise their core body temperature and dry up wet sheets wrapped around their bodies in the cold Himalayan weather (-25 degree Celsius) while meditating."___________________________________________________________A similar, but more modern and well studied case is that of Wim Hof.  said: "We administer endotoxin, a dead cell-wall component of bacteria, to healthy volunteers. The immune system reacts as if real live bacteria have entered the body and mounts an immune response characterized by the production of inflammatory mediators and flu-like symptoms like fever, chills and headache. These experiments are completely safe and have been performed on more than 240 subjects in our centre."...Wim Hof is well known for his remarkable activities in extremely low temperatures. Hof claims that he can influence his autonomic nervous system and thereby suppress his immune response through concentration and meditation.To investigate this, Hof was administered endotoxin while practicing his concentration and meditation technique. During this experiment, various measurements were performed, including brain activity, autonomic nervous system activity and inflammatory mediators in the blood."Wim is one of the few westerners to have learned tum mo, holds all the cold endurance world records, and has been packed in ice for hours, run marathons above the arctic circle barefoot, and lots of other amazing demonstrations.
<|endoftext|>I'm currently reading "Stalking the Wild Pendulum" which presents a stunning thesis including the idea that our brain doesn't generate consciousness, but amplifies it. First thing that popped in my head from that was the dangers of 5g. Which is relevant to the discussion at large, because if all this stuff is real, then of course we should be saying no to 5g (it is, we should). I frequently think about the evolution of consciousness itself. Maybe we can direct the spin of our mental matter into higher dimensions by visualizing quaternions and stuff like that.

<|endoftext|>aw man i missed the peak so this wont get much attention. but i think u/MansplainingToDo might like some more links so i'll ping him. too long, im not gonna read : im in this group that can do some weird thing that feels like adrenaline, at will, wherever/whenever in the body. looks like people whove gotten familiar with it can focus the "adrenaline" in certain parts instead of the whole body if they choose. **"adrenaline" is in quotes because we cant confirm its actually adrenaline** . a urine test disproved adrenal metabs-or whatever- were absent. and a secondary feeling stemming from the brain/spine is different, which makes me lean towards calling this source "dopamine". it feels like when you listen to a really good part of a song; that "tingle" feeling. sometimes the activity makes my neck/spine crackle. ive messaged a redditor who felt the same response, and is the only other confirmation that this "secondary" dope rush exists- possibly from the "adrenaline" rushand there is a third and fourth "thing ". the fourth is [this post]( i gotta tell you im not super comfortable talking about these because they border fantasy hahain case anybody old sees this,i made r/forcedadrenalinerush but i deleted my old account. i dunno i just got frustrated, but i kept the old links and scrapped Post Text with them. i have to point out nothing supernatural happens. no slo-motion like the pdf on "[lentation]( something i found very early on. i dont think it's exactly the same, but there were aspects i identified withand the rest of the links below are pretty much personal stories on a spiritual&medical board, about mainly the ("(adrenaline rush)") and one or two authors on possible "((dope))" releases. i havent updated since i killed my last account. i kinda wish i had kept in contact with those other redditors i found who could do this haha people pointed me to r/kundailani or however you spell that yoga practice. but a mod advised it might not be it, because there seems to be an emotional part of this as well,anger, that can flare up the "adrenaline" part. flares up so much, it causes EXTREME physical stomach pain for a few minutes. theres a more extreme part to the "dope" release too. but the worst ive done is panic, because my brain pulsed/throbbed 2-3 times in a period of about 1-2 minutes. its happened a few times. but i havent cranked it up to 10/10 on either because im a bit scared of finding out if "too much" exists lol. on adrenaline, keep in mind from earlier that i can focus on whatever body parts,even "all"my body. why did i do either? it started in 2003 in my third grade; i did it because it felt good. now im doing it because im trying to see what comes next 
<|endoftext|>Cool topic! Here are some links I've found about psychic research and the unlocking of human potential in China and Russia during the Cold War. &#x200B;[
<|endoftext|>One of my favorite books that kind of explores this is Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein. The basic premise is sometime in the future we travel to Mars and that expedition dies. 20 or so years later we try again and when human beings land they find a martian civilization as well as one human who was a baby when the last Expedition died off. Michael Valentine Smith was then raised by the Martians and when he returns to earth he had what seemed like Supernatural powers. The reason he can do these things is he was raised by Martians, using Martian ideas /language and he goes on to teach many of the other characters how to do these things once they "learn how to think in Martian". It's kind of the same idea as if you were a civilization that had never seen War (or whatever) you never would have developed the word for it, because you had no concept of it. And if you don't have the basic concept of something, there's absolutely no way you can do it. You grok?
<|endoftext|> skeptical of these people. The above video is of a Chinese MMA fighter who challenges masters of various mystic arts, and absolutely man handles them every single time. So right off the bat no amount of chakra or kung fu will stop a grown man who has trained at regular martial arts from kicking your ass. As for the video in OPs link. Those are most likely parlor tricks. There are reasons that all mysticism goes away under controlled testing. The fire aspect is a well known scam run in China frequently. The best and only example I can think of people doing insane inhuman acts is Wim Hoff the Iceman. Seriously the guy can do amazing things but I dont think its supernatural
<|endoftext|>A lot of these phenomena are explained with Bill Gaede's theory of Light. "Every atom is connected to every other atom via electromagnetic 'ropes', the 'rope' unwinds at the "electron shell" and one *thread* goes through the center and one stays at the shell.It is the accumulation of all the countless threads that make the "proton" so dense. The friction of the winding-and-unwinding threads at the atom's surface as it pulses ("quantum jumps") is "Energy".Light travels fast, straight and retraces its path. *Everything is actually connected*. Gaede explains Gravity with these same connections, are you being pushed down by Spacetime, or are you being pulled down to Earth?This is not "string theory".Easy three minute video: Two minutes:

<|endoftext|>Real Magic by Dean Radin. Great shirt read. The true nature of reality has been curated. 
<|endoftext|>I would love to speak to some more on Wim Hoff methods. He has been tested in a medical setting and can be proven. As for myself, I think people should start with practical applications and then move up from there. I listen to a lot of Tony Robbins and I am a huge fan of Earl Nightingale. I am a follower of Earl Nightingale's protege and it has helped me a ton in my daily life. I think that these type teachings can be used in more of a practical, daily life type help. They aren't earth shattering teachings but it is something that will change your life by teaching you to be more accountable in your daily life. That last part is something that I think people have lost in modern society. They take the easy way out, they find a boogey man to blame for their own shortcomings and have lost all drive because it is just easier to do that. They hear all of these people telling them, "YOU CAN'T DO IT" "The Govt has ruined everything!!!" "The American Dream is DEAD!!!" yadda yadda. When you take personal accountability for your *own* life, you lose the ability to find a boogey-man or someone to blame. You take the broad perspective, data sets, socio-economic indicators, etc... out of it and realize you alone are responsible for where you end up. It is very empowering when you realize these things. It is also hard but anything that has any true value, takes work to get it.

<|endoftext|>Have you read Koestler's *The Roots of Coincidence*?Amazing book that covers all of the early and (in the 70s) recent "psy" research, including Ganzfeld experiments, card/number/shape guess influencing, etc.Paints quite a convincing case, a shame and a mystery why this field has been so neglected.
<|endoftext|>The Field by Mctaggart is fantastic. A must read for anyone wanting to connect and ground spirituality and science (as well as many things considered "paranormal" or "supernatural" - which is simply the word to describe something that is completely natural but not yet understood and fully integrated into and by mainstream science).Another book that attempts this, but does so from a different, more philosophical angle, is The Science Delusion by Rupert Sheldrake (definitely not an anti science book despite the title [which he made in answer to Dawkins's God Delusion] since the author himself is a scientist, a researcher and holds a PhD in biochemistry - just a book that questions modern materialistic assumption of science and shows how most of them are entirely based on assumption and not on reality or hard evidence).A more physics-centered book connecting science and spirit is David Bohm's (Nobel laureate and famously acclaimed physicist) Chaos and The Implicate Order. Another perspective on bridging mysticism and science is brought forth by Robert Lanza PhD M.D. in his book Biocentrism.And yet another physicist tackling this connection is Nassim Haramein who also has a subreddit on Reddit made by his supporters r/holofractal , one of the better subs on Reddit to discuss the science-spirit connection and grounding metaphysics into physics. 
<|endoftext|> it is very possible that we are able to connect with the universe at a conscious level and influence it to some degree.How do they examine that scientifically?
<|endoftext|>This reminds me of all the environmental factors that people think cause humans to see ghosts. Low-frequency vibrations, etc. Absolutely fascinating - and the most interesting thing I read on this is there are certain frequencies that can cause people to see these weird gray blobs in your field of vision.When I was in high school, one of my teachers told a story about how he saw a ghost once - and his description of the ghost is precisely the "grey blob" description I read regarding this phenomenon. Wild.
<|endoftext|>On this, here's a direct link to the declassified CIA document "Analysis and Assessment of the Gateway Process" which goes into biofeedback, transcendental meditation, out-of-body-expereiences, astral projection, remote viewing, etc. 
<|endoftext|>It is entirely not bullshit, you are correct that is not all bullshit. Makes you wonder the reasons behind rank denial and hyper skepticism. Some of it is perhaps rooted in fear, some of it, rooted in some nefarious shit.
<|endoftext|>thousands of dollars? more like billions! have you seen the list of CIA research topics that came out recently? it goes way deeper than remote viewing (which is already off the wall nuts to your average middle American)  [ 
<|endoftext|>Out of body experiences are a real phenomenon, and the idea that some people can use it for astral projection is a fascinating subject. I've had the opportunity to try [DMT]( and had some very eye opening experiences. Just to recount some, I first tried it at a very miniscule dose. Much lower than the "breakthrough dose". When I approach a new drug, I like to research as much as possible and always start very small. In the smallest doses I tested, I had amazing experiences. The first was when I was outside and tried just barely a grain or two of DMT on a bowl. My vision became enhanced to the point where I could see individual grains of sand 50 yards away with a clarity that was shocking to say the least. My thought process wasn't impaired whatsoever, and I had full control of all my faculties.The second experience I had, I tried a slightly higher dose, but still nowhere close to the breakthrough dose resulting in ego death. I once again put a small amount of DMT on a bowl while in my bedroom and took a rip. Several moments after exhaling the smoke, I experienced one of my most clear headed out of body experiences I've ever had. My sense of self seemed to leave my body and rise above my body. I now had a visual point of view from above and behind myself. I could see 360 degrees from this point of view, and had full clarity of mind. I didn't feel high or muddled as I do when smoking weed. I was very clear headed. After several moments of this, I willed myself back to my body and was completely normal again with no side affects whatsoever. This changed my whole idea of consciousness and reality in general. Very cool stuff.
<|endoftext|>Ummm, have you ever considered that all of that is declassified because it was all actual *intended* as counterintelligence!?As in the CIA pretends to be pouring billions of dollars into this stuff by making a few bullshit documents that are then intercepted by spies prompting the Soviets to *actually* waste a ton of time and money playing catch up to a technology that was all bullshit from the start?(Meanwhile all that money is actually poured into drug smuggling, black projects, and buying out the USSR with the Black Eagle fund which *never* actually had any Nazi gold).I mean, when you stop using wishful thinking about psychic powers, and remember that the stated goal of the CIA is for everything you know to be a lie doesnt this make much more sense!?
<|endoftext|>I would like to further the discussion on Wim Hof as I am an occasional practitioner of the Wim Hof Method and I am convinced that he has rediscovered an innate human ability to create body heat and influence other physiological processes on command, and he is able to teach the average person how to do so. The Wim Hof Method is essentially a breathing and meditation exercise combined with gradually increasing cold exposure. The magic of it is in the breathing exercise itself, as this method of breathing enables your body to do some pretty wild things due to what Wim describes as super-oxygenation of the blood, which then supposedly sets off a cascade of other physiological phenomena. The breathing exercise itself is done either sitting or lying down and it is a very large diaphragmatic inhale to the point where your lungs are completely filled with air, followed by a natural exhale to the point where your lungs still have approx. 20% air volume remaining. This cycle is repeated for three to five sets of 30 breaths. At the last rep of each 30 breath set you take a full inhale followed by a full and complete exhale to where there is no air in your lungs. You then hold your breath until you feel the first natural impulse to breath, during which time you rely on the oxygen in your blood stream. Once you feel the need to breath you take a full inhale and then hold your breath for as long as you can. When you feel the need to breath again, you restart the continuous breathing cycle and go for another 30 or so breaths. &#x200B;I will endeavor to explain the subjective experience one will have during a Wim Hof Method session, but it is a lot of woo-woo and is different from person to person so YMMV. Subjectively, as you reach the end of your first cycle of breathing, you will begin to experience a tingling energy sensation in your extremities, sometimes it extends to your face and scalp. You will generally begin to feel what can best be described as an energized looseness in your body, as well as a clarity of mind similar to deep meditative states. At the complete exhale on the end of a cycle you will not feel the need to breath for much longer than you would expect. Instead of feeling the panicked neck and chest spasms of oxygen deprivation, you are just relaxed and feel at peace, yoga style. Then the following full inhalation and hold brings a rush of oxygen and you will create surges of energy throughout your body. These feelings grow and grow during each successive cycle of the exercise. At the end of a session you feel a relaxed calmness but paradoxically are also full of energy and determination. Its difficult to explain and is one of those things that has to be experienced to be understood. The second phase of training is combining the breathing exercises with cold exposure, preferably with cold water, so like a shower set to 55 F. When doing the exercises in the cold, you will just gradually not feel cold anymore. It's nuts. &#x200B;Wim Hof himself is not an especially academically inclined person so its difficult to get a fully scientific explanation of what is happening from him, he prefers to say stuff like 'the breath will CHARGE YOU UP', so finding a good scientific explanation is difficult. But people postulate that the successive hyperoxygenation and oxygen deprivation cycles causes an alkalization of the blood, which dampens pain receptor signaling and causes the brain to secrete serotonin, adrenaline, and dopamine, as it perceives danger, and its all these chemicals that make you feel good. Further the cycles of oxygenation create osmotic pressure in each cell of the body to absorb oxygen, so your blood oxygen saturation goes to the next level. There are videos of people doing the exercises while wearing one of the blood saturation finger monitors and you can watch it in real time. Supposedly this is responsible for the increase in energy one feels. I don't know the full explanation of it, but subjectively it works. You breath like Wim and expose yourself to the cold and think about being warm and your body will do it for you. &#x200B;I encourage everyone to research the Wim Hof Method some more. r/BecomingTheIceman is a great place to start.
<|endoftext|>Just an anecdote of how Wim Hof changed my life:For 4 years I have been struggling with nasal inflamation due to deformation, making me ill every 3 months. Didn't have time for surgery to fix it. I had fever, inflamed nasal cavities, a lot of pain, etc. It made my life miserable, being sick every 3 months. Then, ~1.5-2 years ago I started doing the Wim Hof Method. I stopped doing it after 10-12 weeks (I don't even know why, I'm a lazy fuck). Haven't had an issue with nasal inflamation ever since. If I feel like I'm coming down with it, I just to the 3-4 rounds of breathing exercises. For me, it is a testament for its benefits. Nothing else changed in my life. It might be a coincidence, but I don't think so.
<|endoftext|>For anyone interested in how to harness consciousness, metaphysics, and science, is like to suggest checking out [Consciousness Hacking]( There are lots of people working to understand, demonstrate, and share these phenomena, and put them to work for good. 
<|endoftext|>I would not be surprised in the slightest to learn that the extreme pervasiveness of electrical fields (radio, wifi, 3/4/5g cell towers, the electric field generated from operating 2 TVs and 4 computers in every home, etc., etc.) has a detrimental effect on this "ability" or facet of human experience.And to your point about us being "receivers" more-so than "broadcasters", I totally agree. We are the universe experiencing itself. And I believe that goes further than just a common material origin (aka the whole "we are stardust" line). Thanks for the post!
<|endoftext|>It helps if you work in a job that provides a service to fellow humans. Medical field is good. Learn to isolate, process, and assimilate strong emotions you feel.
<|endoftext|>I can relate. I certainly have some empathic ability. I was like it as a kid, but then I sorta cut myself off from my emotions as a teenager so I was quite robotic/hard-line atheist, but then several years ago something happened in my life which forced me to get back in touch with my emotions (thankfully) and sent me down a spiritual path and now I'm pretty aware of my empathic capabilities. It's useful in the sense that you can understand how someone's feeling before they even say anything, but I have a habit of trying to fix things so it can be awkward when I'm trying to give people advice on their emotions before I even know the details of their material circumstances haha. But friends naturally come to me for advice so I think it's good in that respect. Also, my first impressions of other people tend to be very accurate, so it's very useful in that regard! I know who's good good intentions and who's got bad ones. But because it's not "psychic," per se, I don't know *why* people have those intentions specifically. I can feel if someone doesn't mean well but it's hard to work out specifically if they intend harm, if they want to steal, if they're gonna lie about something, etc. Anyway, enough about me. Here's a great video resource (lecture/presentation) that addresses this concept from a scientific standpoint: ["Rupert Sheldrake: The Extended Mind"](  Sheldrake coined the terms "morphogenetic fields" and "morphogenetic resonance" in regards to the electromagnetic fields that surround the body and the way that they interact with one another when in close proximity. These fields contain information, and when two or more of these fields are overlapping they can communicate information with each other faster than you could with words, and if you're in tune with this and know how to interpret the signal then you can interpret the information. This is the essence of psychic phenomena.

<|endoftext|>Thank you! And thanks for getting that debunking article posted asap, as its a *very* common refrain from people who see this video, that the footage is "fake" or the demonstrations are "tricks" or the scientists determined to find a fraud are "actors in on the scam".I'd just like to address some of these and hopefully keep them from attempting to derail the conversation:-"Pyrokinesis demonstration was just "glycerin and potassium permanganate capsules mixed to start a fire" in the paper"first of all, this is what that reaction looks like (note the unnatural colour of the fire):  this is what it looks like when Chang does it:  electricity - this is normally done with the use of a small high-frequency, high-voltage, low-amperage device taped to the performer's body. James Randi mentions this device here, regarding others who have done this"There are literally 3 scientists who suspect this, strip search search his entire body with a metal detector, THEN they make him do the demonstration at a randomly chosen hotel room miles away just in case he had some kind of "device" on his property that allowed his "tricks". They find nothing and he performs the demonstration at the hotel flawlessly.______________________________________________________-"Catching a "rifle bullet" - what is shown is the firing of a very low-speed pellet that can pierce the wall of an empty soda can. Then, Chang puts his hand in front of the gun. He is in no danger, and there does not appear to be anything extraordinary about what he is doing."The "debunking" seems to miss the fact that he stopped this 700+fps metal pellet *WITHOUT DEFORMING IT*. Go shoot a pump pellet gun at any surface that it won't penetrate. Is the pellet deformed or not when it impacts that surface?_____________________________________________________- ""Fooling the experts" - they have a CEO, a doctor, and a physicist. They really needed an electrical engineer."I mean what? I'm pretty certain a medic, a neuroscientist, and a physicist understand how electrical impulses work. Attacks on the scientists are unfounded and don't hold up to scrutiny when you find out all 3 have continued on with their careers without attempting to make a cent off of appearing in this documentary.
<|endoftext|>Hey, thanks for the post. This does sound like bio-energy or chi or honestly whatever you want to call it, but maybe your approach to it is affecting your experience?If you think its adrenaline, it will feel like adrenaline, if you get what I'm trying to say. And to your point about "too much", what I've read really does point to this being a "muscle" that needs work and attention, as opposed to some innate potential that just needs to be pushed. I've heard many stories of disastrous consequences.I would point you and anyone feeling similar to a book like Robert Bruce's *Energy Work*. It presents a quite neutral, but most importantly *tactile* means of developing (to some extent atleast) this "muscle", without any religious trappings or non-useful ritual.Also, I'd look into the ancient conceptions of the body, learn the major chakra centers/meridians, see if they coincide with places you feel tension or pain. If so, you can narrow your search to practices that might help with your specific issue.edit: this appears to be a pdf of the book I mentioned, give it a quick browse and see if anything resonates.
<|endoftext|> and a secondary feeling stemming from the brain/spine is different, which makes me lean towards calling this source "dopamine". it feels like when you listen to a really good part of a song; that "tingle" feeling. sometimes the activity makes my neck/spine crackle.Have you ever heard of [Autonomous sensory meridian response]( (ASMR)??It sounds a lot like what you're talking about, and is quite popular.
<|endoftext|>No one who wants to have a real discussion thinks it's supernatural. By definition if it appears in nature it isn't.Wim practices a tradition quite similar (at its foundation) to Mo Pai (Chang's lineage), known as Tummo.You mention "regular" martial arts as if it's somehow wholly divorced from the internal arts. If you look into the history of martial arts, you will understand that at its inception, there was no separation between the two.
<|endoftext|>Videos are a bit funky but I can see there's something beneath the cartoon graphics...does he have a subreddit or forum or anything where he goes in depth? The link on the video to his group is dead. Edit: just found his quora page:  you read about r/holofractal? I think you might find some interesting overlap in the ideas there.
<|endoftext|>Astral projection is very real. It can be used for remote viewiewing. Here is a class that teaches how to develop remote viewing skills.  the class is taught by a remote viewer that connects to her astral body for police to either find bodies or where people hide money during laundering/embezzlement. One may also access the Akashic records if they can connect to the astral plane. 
<|endoftext|>I've astrally projected once. I used to lucid dream a lot, and I can tell you that it felt much different. There's this hyper lucidity that came with my projecting that I'd liken to lucid dreaming if "real life" is the dream state. Similar mechanics between the two, but where dreams are an internal projection of conscious astral projection is an external one. But when you do it you just know from the feel that it's different. 
<|endoftext|>I've seen you post around here since before I made my first reddit account 8+ years ago. Kinda disappointed you of all posters would take the easy, non-critical way out of the discussion. Not only is it plain silly to try and paint Chang in this light (He's been happily married to the same woman since 19 with 7 children, he never once charged or accepted donations from **any** patient or student, beyond a one time healing or course of treatment he had no established "following" (i.e. harem) unless you count an extremely small group of male students, ended all further video appearance because of personal reservations about "showing off" with his abilities, etc.) but its a disingenuous dismissal of an entire topic because you happened to recently read a story that paints enigmatic "healers" in a horrible light. And misses the rest of the topic which is so much broader than one man.IDK...I guess I just expected better from someone with your prolific post history.

<|endoftext|>No I haven't, but I will definitely check it out! Looks really interesting.Thanks for the suggestion.
<|endoftext|>I'm glad you mentioned the books by Rupert Sheldrake. After reading The Field, I bought a copy of Sheldrake's book, "Morphic Resonance". That book was incredible and I feel like it leads to a lot of questions about the nature of reality.I also got into Stanislaw Grof's book, [Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transendence in Psychotherapy]( This book is a little more difficult in terms of easy reading, but pretty interesting as he tackles subjects along the lines of hallucinogenics and the brain.
<|endoftext|> r/holofractalFor those who aren't too blown away by this, try also considering this material....[The Law of One](
<|endoftext|>Perhaps there's something about the laws of physics that prevents it or something. Idk. Maybe we have more control over the natural world than we thought, but not complete mastery over it... Food for thought
<|endoftext|>Precisely. Goverments, agencies, and various other groups have been researching this stuff and employing certain individuals with various talents, specifically relating to these topics.I know this as fact, and things like the link youve sent, add more to the pile of evidence that this is a legitimate thing in the eyes of the militaries, goverments, businesses, and much more.The implications, both good bad and all of the area in between, well, some have already gotten to know first hand some of those implications, for better or worse.It aint all fairy tales, but its also no walk in the park.Id be remiss, if i didnt mention that my general perception, based off the information ive attained and experiences, those of my own and others, make these phenomena somewhat if not very close in voracity and profundity to non terrestrial life, other forms of intelligent life, and what many simply deem "supernatural."
<|endoftext|>Or maybe human brains are actually more digital than AI, because everything has to be one way or the other.
<|endoftext|>Hear hear, it is a life changing experience.I got my hands on some after keeping an ear out for years (hard to get in my area) and tried a light dose the first time and everything was beautiful patterns - with only enough left to experience a true breakthrough the second time, i went all in.Nothing can ever prepare you for what you see when you break through - i can see how it would break some people mentally but for me it was the most enlightening experience of my life, one thousand fold more so than anything i have ever experienced. After a few days of feeling mild anxiety when recalling parts of the trip, i have now never been more mentally stable in my life.
<|endoftext|>Poisoning the well fallacy- The CIA lies - everything that the CIA declassifies that I do not understand or does not fit into my worldview is a lie.Quoting a CIA Director circa 1981 does not prove a stated goal for an entire agency, CIA declassified docs may be falsified, quotes can be falsified as well.  
<|endoftext|>In the FOIA archvies theres hundreds of pages discussion how the US felt it was playing catch up to the soviets who were vastly outspending them in "paranormal research" &#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B; 
<|endoftext|> I can relate. I certainly have some empathic ability. This confuses me.....who doesn't? Is this not just reasoning? How can someone not be able to put themselves in anothers shoes...
<|endoftext|>I can relate I have similar experiences sometimes i even get a thought from someone its really strange.
<|endoftext|>I can. If I'm on my own then I'm only feeling what I'm feeling. But if I'm around someone else then there's a high chance that I'll be feeling their feelings over/on top of my own. The more time I spend close with someone the more time I have to tune in with their emotions and feel them better/more accurately. I'm I'm spending ages with someone then I can really tune in and even influence how someone else feels. I can't hear what someone's thinking, so it's not psychic in that respect, but I can feel their emotions without knowing their thoughts. If I meet someone for the first time, then so long as I'm aware in my own emotional state I can get a great first impression from feeling how feel. Knowing my own emotional state just establishes a baseline to compare the difference to. To give an example, at my last job there was this new supervisor being hired. The day I met him I was having a great day and was calm as ever. As soon as I met him, introduced myself and gave a handshake, I had this strong feeling of sneaky/subversiveness/exploitation and as soon as I felt that I knew I couldn't trust this guy. Had no physical reason to, he'd done nothing wrong, but I could feel that he wanted to and that was enough for me. Over the next two weeks the boss heard complaints about how the supervisor had been walking around places he shouldn't be, eventually a coworker had 50 stolen from her purse, then then he was never seen again. Called in sick and never came back. The guy had clearly been stealing stuff from all across the site, but it'd already been done at that point. 
<|endoftext|>Amen, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you. Then he said to his disciples, The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. People will tell you, There he is! or Here he is! Do not go running off after them. For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
<|endoftext|>Are you saying the monk was doing it through the act of observation rather than 'directly' controlling/influencing it?

Deservedly called out for uninformed comment. And have been taking Reddit much less seriously as the censorship and control seems to be more prevalent as the years go by.

<|endoftext|>the East has known about Grof's stuff a lot longer:Mantak Chia: Techniques to Activate The Second Brain
<|endoftext|>I've always been a huge Ra fan. I am not very fond of channeled material in general, but I definitely make an exception for the LoO material.
<|endoftext|> but not complete mastery over itWell that much we know! The possibilities are potentially endless.
<|endoftext|>I think you will find this article intriguing goes into similarities in how our neural network has aspects of both analog and digital in a sense, but:"The bottom line is that the brain processes information using a representation strategy that is neither analog nor digital. It is a different type of computation, involving circuits and networks composed of spiking neurons. One of the central tasks of neuroscience is to figure out how this information processing paradigm works."
<|endoftext|>Just remember, everything the CIA does outside and beyond US borders, besides simply flying in international airspace or crossing international waters is by definition "a criminal activity". That's why they're forbidden to operate within US borders, not that they don't do that when they know they can get away with it.It's a criminal and clandestine organisation with a long track record of assassinations, sabotage, gun-running, drug and human trafficking, and wanton acts of terrorism and there's nothing that they wouldn't lie about to cover-up anything of that nature.
<|endoftext|>It isnt a fallacy, it is *logical deduction* something severely lacking here. Why would they be interested in google, amazon or Facebook if they can just use psychic power!?Are you at all familiar with Reagans Star Wars program?The CIA deals in subterfuge and disinformation.
<|endoftext|>Nah, substances shouldnt be used as a coping mechanism. You need to find a way to process it normally. Otherwise it becomes a crutch then easily an addiction.Every once in a while is fine but definitely consumption shouldnt be the primary way to process emotions.
<|endoftext|>Not exactly. Being "an empath" is basically like being psychic but with emotions. I don't like using labels like someone "is" or "isn't" an empath, because I think it's just latent potential within humans. A muscle you need to exercise. 
<|endoftext|>I am in this boat as well. I can feel the intention (not emotion) of the individuals I'm close to. The closer/more I know an individual the more I am bound to them as well. I can literally read the mind of my spouse, but with strangers I can only "feel" what they're really implying behind the words.It's very hard to explain to others, but disingenuous, inauthentic, deceptive are the words I'd use for a lot of the people in the world. They say one thing, but their intent is far from their words. The person will literally say what they think, masquerading it by placing the sentence in the negative or in a humorous light.I can't stress this enough but from my experience, **every single thing a person says is for a reason** (or what they're really thinking). There is no meaningless small talk or chit-chat. If you listen/feel close enough, the person is saying exactly what is on their mind - without completely saying it most of the time.It gets disturbing at parties and large groups - it makes me want to stay home most of the time. My wife can tell when I'm uneasy and helps me by disengaging with individuals who are "vampyric" or duplicitous in public environments. The good thing about it is, although it seems the overwhelming majority of people I meet are not who they appear to be, there is even a greater majority of authentic real people out there who wish you nothing but the best (you just need to be in spaces where people like that congregate).&#x200B;
<|endoftext|>But if I'm around someone else then there's a high chance that I'll be feeling their feelings over/on top of my own.Don't most people do that? Studies have shown that even dogs have that ability.
<|endoftext|>couldn't it be argued that they're pretty closely connected (with the difference being the exertion of will)
<|endoftext|>Alrighty, for context the only other hallucinogenics I've tried are acid (once) and mushies a few times plus the rare nitrous oxide canisters here and there - none have given me any full on immersive visuals or at least nothing close to this. So after hearing about DMT and reading about it being an enlightening experience, "mechanical elves" and all that shit i was very interested in trying some, i also avoided reading too many trip reports or anything that might influence my experience furthermore.I'll cut to the point.Basically i had a small cone (of weed) with maybe just under a point of DMT sprinkled on top and smoked it up. As the spinning lights and everything began to intensify i had to simply give in, so i let go and everything sort of sucked in and came to one tiny focal point with audio that sounded like something crawling to a stop and then there was silence and darkness for a fraction of a second before it all exploded out again, me with it. As i approached whatever it was (i was flying up a tube towards a light) i felt fearful and in pure awe. Then i saw whatever it was, something that could not be described as we don't have the words to describe it, it was made of shapes that i could immediately after not comprehend but at the time were amazing to me - i felt that 'I've finally got it!' feeling, like i had finally just completely got the whole point of it all - life that is.I remember seeing all these objects clear as day that i could never have imagined, they were incomprehensible, something that i could never ever have even imagined to exist because whatever they looked like or were doing makes no sense to my Earthly mind (however at the time it did ofcourse.) I remember feeling all emotions at peak levels but mostly the feeling of betrayal due to the fact that 'everyone' had kept this from me for so long and embarrassment (mixed with idiocy) because it had taken me this long to "get it" when it had been so simple and obvious the whole time... These bad feelings only lasted for a few seconds before the entire experience sort of overwhelmed any bad feelings and I was filled with the feeling of pure joy and warmth as i just tried to take in everything whilst in a state of pure awe. God knows hold long this lasted or felt like it lasted, my memory after the above can not be recalled. This was followed by the fast paced, confusing and headfucky revert back to conciousness (or my body rather) which felt like i was jumping between various life events (most of which did not appear to be my own) and finally it ended with a small loop of me trying to speak to my friend where i would frantically try and explain something to him and then it would restart, which felt very similar to a nitrous oxide finish - As i opened my eyes i could see what looked like the imprint of peacocks wallpapered along my vision and i shook my head a few times as they faded all the while repeating "WTF" over and over and attempting to explain what just happened to my friend however not having the words to describe what i had just experienced, i remember initially forgetting i had even had any DMT and thinking i had just had a mental break or something - which passed very shortly after ofcourse.My friend said i had taken the hit, closed my eyes and sat still for 5 minutes (he said my breathing was so shallow he thought i had stopped.)Minutes after coming back i couldn't exactly recall what i'd seen, neither could i today - however i will always remember the absolute extreme feeling of epiphany, understanding and knowing that of the like of which i have never, ever experienced before... And there we have it.
<|endoftext|>Which is more reliable AI or humans? Which requires more upkeep and training? Its a lot easier to condition a populous to give away their information for free to a screen than it is to go inside their head and take it from them one would think.I don't know where the strategic defense initiative fits into this, but I'll bite, what does the star wars program have to do with unrecognized and underutilized human potential?
<|endoftext|>You are assuming the reach of this new power they might have or wish to obtain would be to the extent it would fulfill all their wishes...
<|endoftext|>Damn, that third paragraph... Well, actually you've nailed it on the whole thing, but that third paragraph specifically! I hear you on that! Someone doesn't have to be using any particular words to not still be *saying something*, you just gotta know how to listen. 
<|endoftext|>I believe that these abilities are inherent within everyone, but it just takes exercising/training the body & mind in the right way to unlock them I believe that our current society has been designed to suppress these abilities via the food we eat, the information we're sold, the jobs we're convinced to work, and the overload of emotional & physical stimulus that prevents us from tuning into these abilities in the first place. It took me a hard and fast trip down the spiritual rabbit hole to awaken what I so fat have in myself. Yeah definitely dogs are very perceptive on that level! If you look into the work of Rupert Sheldrake (I left a link to one of his lectures on "the extended mind" in another comment of mine here) he talks about dogs and their highly perceptive abilities, and even the fact that most dogs have a psychic connection with their owners and get excited when their owner has left work and are heading home, despite not being able to know this via their usual senses. Emotions and thoughts exist at a certain frequency and don't necessarily remain within the head. The chemical action that denotes which emotional/thought centres within the brain are active and interacting remain in the brain, but the effects, the thoughts and emotions themselves, act like ripples on the surface of the pond. They radiate out in every direction, but getting weaker the further they travel. The mind exists around the body, though centred within the brain. A localised field, like a biomagnetic field. It's possible to tune your body to respond to stimulus of that frequency and read emotion/thought without the need for the other person to "physically" express it, but it usually takes time and effort. 
<|endoftext|>John 15:15I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.
<|endoftext|>I'd accept that argument if he could force the outcome by exertion of will yes, like the 2 slit experiment, not just guessing the correct result but actually making x or y happen by choice..
<|endoftext|>It seems more likely to me that pack animals like dogs and humans evolved the ability to recognise the emotions of those around them because it increases survivability.I can't think of any specific environmental pressure that would cause humans to evolve telepathic abilities.
<|endoftext|>that's the implication! who knows if it's true though. earlier in the thread i posted a link about chinese psychic spy-children...in that article it says that the chinese gov't had recruited a team of kids who were capable of doing such things. 
<|endoftext|>Efficient communication. Humans and dogs are social animals, as you rightly pointed out, so this example fits well here. If you can communicate information mind field to mind field then you can, in theory, communicate large amounts of information to either an individual or a group of individuals without the need to process that information via the brain-body machine. There'd be no need to put it into words of a language and communicate it vocally. The information would be communicated practically immediately and bypass that function entirely. I don't think it's just humans and dogs, but literally every conscious being that has this capability. Whether or not they utilise it is another matter dependent on local variables, but the capability is inherent to anything that is consciousness. From the smallest scale to the largest. There's information being processed and communicated on every scale and frequency simultaneously; on the atomic scale, the molecular, the cellular, the organismal, the emotional, and the mental. Psychology is applied biology, biology is applied chemistry, chemistry is applied physics, physics is applied maths, and from geometry - which is fundamental to the universe - all mathematical principles can be derived. Information transfer (aka communication) on any scale or frequency has its respective counterparts on the other frequencies. A chemical interaction in the brain has its emotional counterpart. A physical interaction as light enters the eye has its biological counterpart in the interpretation of that light. The physical action of speaking has its mental counterpart in the thinking of the thought which preceded the putting of said thought into words. If you train your body to respond to the physical senses it will do so. If you train it to respond to mental and emotional stimulus it will do so. If you neglect either you will lose that ability. Having physical bodies its easy for us to exercise our physical muscles and respond on that scale. Thoughts and emotions aren't "physical," so to be more sensitive to communication on that scale requires the exercising of our mental and emotional "muscles." Mindful/vipassana meditation and yoga can help this. Even a psychedelic experience can help widen the limits of your perception. 
<|endoftext|>Honestly reading a lot of these just come of as wannabe superheroes. They claim telepathic abilities but downplay it, then offer up a story that illustrates how they just KNEW something bad was going to happen, and instead of acting on that feeling, regretfully watched it happen, confirming their belief in their superpowers yet never giving them the courage to don the suits and act upon them.
<|endoftext|>I've heard about it but never read an article, you got the link?I reckon we'll all be psychic one day; maybe not organically but by way of symbiosis/integrating with bio-technology, **cyborgs,**our humanity either diluted or dynamised, depends how you see it..?
<|endoftext|>I feel like this would be a really easy theory to test in a laboratory environment. Has there ever been a double blind study done?
<|endoftext|>if you google 'chinese psychic children' you'll find what i'm talking about but here's one of the links i posted:  i'll move out to the woods before i let myself be implanted with proprietary technology. 
<|endoftext|>I referenced Rupert Sheldrake in one of my previous comments. He's been part of teams who've done scientific studies into psychic phenomenon with dogs, alongside other experiments. I suggest starting with researching into his material. To get a quick background on him I'd recommend his hour long lecture "the extended mind" which you can find on YouTube. 
<|endoftext|>I wonder which way I'd go; natural biology or supernatural cyborg, do you think society will split into sects like vaccine/antivaxxers and be totally polarised or just coexist peacefully?
<|endoftext|>i am no seer but it seems like division is increasing. either we'll go full-on 1984/brave new world unified top-down society or neo-feudalism. my gut instinct is that there will be another large 9/11 type event that sparks off a period of instability and war, and then whatever emerges from the ashes will be the paradigm that defines the next century or so 
<|endoftext|>Yes, but I'm currently lying in bed and replying on my phone so don't expect me to find a link for you. Shouldn't be hard to find one though. 
<|endoftext|>I tend to agree, but will it be an event that divides us globally (like 9/11) or one that unifies all of humanity, like climate change or disclosure of ET?I reckon another false flag, one that'll either make or break the NWO..
<|endoftext|>So I just read through Sheldrake's "The 'Psychic Pet' Phenomenon" and found it extremely unscientific. Is that a bad example or is that the standard for his research?
<|endoftext|>Ah, cryptids. My kind of conspiracy. Curious to see which one is deemed most likely to exist. Im going with bigfoot, as he exists(?) across the globe, and across a wide spectrum of cultures. The fact that giant squids are real makes me happy; i was so excited when they first found a live one.
<|endoftext|>Back in the '90s/2000s a couple huge topics among conspiracy circles was human cloning and human-animal hybrids. With dolly the sheep and all the sorts of advancements going on at the time in genetic engineering it was just all the rage. Then it got pushed to the wayside as a real fringe topic. There were all sorts of stories and reports (no doubt loads of them were fake and made up for tabloid newspapers and the like, such as the famous [bat child who was found in a cave]( but some in particular that I remember were about secret military operations in which soldiers were being cloned and genetically enhanced. It's not too much of a stretch from soldiers being given performance enhancing drugs, which has practically been common practice for hundreds, if not thousands, of years across many cultures. Getting a bit more fringe, I remember stories of the US/Russian/Chinese militaries creating [chimpanzee-human]( and pig-human hybrids. For what reasons? I can't particularly remember, and I find it hard to imagine why. But interesting to think about. Another angle on human cloning goes on into the elite bloodline/immortal rulers side of things. I mean, even today you have billionaires like Peter Thiel talking openly about how [transfusions of young blood makes you live longer]( so who really knows what the hyper-rich (like, "own the banks"/royalty rich) people are doing behind the scenes to keep them younger. This angle could get off topic a bit if I carry on, so for this comment I'll just leave it here.
<|endoftext|>With the sheer volume of uncharted water on earth, I would say we can guarantee that any unknown cryptid would be in the sea.
<|endoftext|>I think the Kraken isnt unlikely and I dont think its just a giant squid. At the end of the day I think it is a very very large octopus. Octopi are incredibly intelligent creatures and very adept predators. Its not surprising that giant ones would start to stay hidden after encountering violent humans at the surface.
<|endoftext|>[The Sasquatch Genome Project]( scientific name for sasquatch is Homo Sapiens Cognatus. Genomic research indicates the species is around 15,000 years old. Sasquatch are indigenous aboriginal people. Their maternal lineage is human and their paternal lineage is an unknown hominin. The Sasquatch Genome Project was funded $500,000 and tested over 100 purported sasquatch samples. The study used standard forensic protocols and cutting-edge genotyping technology to determine the sasquatch DNA samples came from a human-hybrid source previously unknown to science."It has been a long and tedious battle to prove that Sasquatch exists. We have had the proof for 8 years now, but building enough data to convince mainstream science has taken a lot of time. Trying to publish took almost two years. It seems mainstream science just cant seem to tolerate something controversial, especially from a group of primarily forensic scientists and not famous academians aligned with large universities, even though most of our sequencing and analysis was performed at just such facilities. We encountered the worst scientific bias in the peer review process in recent history. I am calling it the Galileo Effect. Several journals wouldnt even read our manuscript when we sent them a pre-submission inquiry." - Dr. Melba S.Ketchum.
<|endoftext|>I'll just put this here; [
<|endoftext|>The real cryptids are those you cannot see.Known examples, the walking stick, the chameleons, squid, big cats fur patterns. All efforts to conceal themselves from danger and their prey.What preys on humanity? Other humans? Of course. The occasional wild animal? Occasionally. But what don't we see because it has evolved to be unseen? Lurking in wait and snatching people as it needs. How would we even know or notice? Even in America, considered to be a first world country, we have thousands of unsolved disappearances. Would we even notice the feeding patterns of that which has evolved to elude our eye?Perhaps. Perhaps we might. When it's too late.
<|endoftext|>I reckon Unicorns could have existed for sure. I mean we live in a world where dolphins with horns on their heads exist, why not a horse. I recently came up with a good point for anyone who throws shade towards the possibility of anything pre historic surviving to modern day. The Dodo bird lived into the 1700s and the main cause of its extinction was us hunting them. Clearly not all of them died out because turtles and other animals that lived then are alive now. I find it easy to see that dragons were misidentified dinosaurs that were hunted to extinction. The Panda was looked at 100 years ago like Bigfoot is today. It wasnt until Teddy Roosevelt's son killed one that they were taken seriously. With the size of Mammoth Cave, I'd reckon if you knew your way around those tunnels, you could move across the entire state unseen.
<|endoftext|>Me and a friend once saw two "fairies" at a beach in the pacific northwest. They were insect sized and monocolour with wings, one was crimson red and the other a light cream yellow like the meat of a banana. I'd have written it off as me hallucinating but my friend confirmed it.
<|endoftext|>I love the Bill Gimlan videos suggesting Sasquatch has the ability to release scents that send off signals. Like the infamous smell accompanying them. This being a way to make people flee and also cause the subject to feel terror. Apes can do this apparently. The MK Davis videos suggesting Sasquatch has hair that can act as camouflage is intriguing. I challenge anyone to create a suit on a reasonable budget using 1960s materials with the level of detail and articulation that the Patterson gimlin film shows, until then I'm going on that every piece of evidence that emerges or enhancements that happen, only more signs of a real cryptid emerge. My out there theory is that they are a species of creature that live in the hollow center of the Earth and come up from deep caves systems. I think it's most likely an offshoot of man maybe between man and ape.]
<|endoftext|>the conspiracy behind the concept of cryptids is the propaganda of mainstream science offering the layperson a version of evolution theory thats restricted to the "tree of life" dogma, re: darwinism (but not exclusivly). The temptation to perch Bigfoot onto one of those branches is one of my personal ways to judge the merits of a cryptid researcher. The limits of 17th century taxonomy are carried into 21st century and along with it the dominant politics of that awful era, the racism, the "vertical myopia", the classism, and most importantly "the grand design" dogma that the secularized religions of the deist movement promote. Nothing to do with science as we use it today, and everything to do with today's politicization of science... shows how theories of horizontal evolution render the "tree of life" dogma obsolete.  Get vaxxed and get evolved!

<|endoftext|>i saw one of those big black cats once. Me and a friend saw it and looked away for a second to see if our other friend had climbed this small hill up to us yet then looked back and it had disappeared. No way it could have ran fast enough to dissapear before we looked back.
<|endoftext|>When hunting Rakes, or near one. Watch out for the Guttural Noise they make which will indicate how near they are or close in Proximity.Older/Elder Rakes posses Cloaking Technology and capabilities while younger ones do not. They are hairless and can move faster than humans, so best to use Shotgun to wound when exploring Tunnels or National Parks around 411 disappearances. Many often confuse Rakes with Hyper-Dimensional Beings (Ghost) but they do not posses Hyper-Dimensional abilities.

<|endoftext|>It's better than politcal conspiracies, which are just depressing and anger-inducing. &#x200B;I'd rather watch a documentary on spirits or bigfoot than watch a documentary on how Dow contributed to the Bhopal disaster.
<|endoftext|>Cryptids? What ones do I think exist? Well one is definitely bigfoot, chupacabras, and merpeople, the ladder of which if they are hiding somewhere then I prefer they stay hidden.
<|endoftext|>What if Cryptids in general all came from stories told in the past to cover up mysterious disappearances or murders. Sorta like how Jack the Ripper was likely a bunch of different people, likely lords, potentially some kind of occult relation.People seemed to have been much more gullible in the past. Tell enough people that theres a scary monster killing other people, and eventually some will start to believe it.
<|endoftext|>When did this sub become /r/paranormal? Is the paranormal a conspiracy? I mean its definitely not mainstream but is it really a conspiracy? I just dont see how the blanket topic of "criptids" is a conspiracy theory. Maybe the treatment of criptids by academia is a conspiracy but not just criptids... Imho they are a form of modern mythology closer to faire folklore than the critical cultural analysis we see here. Does something like bigfoot really even belong in a conspiracy forum? It should be in a folklore forum.. but idk I'm sure someone can change my mind.. Does criptid just mean unidentifiable animal or does it mean some kind of paranormal animal that isnt necessarily tangible.Edit, minds on the case.
<|endoftext|>Why do shills insist that we talk about bigfoot and UFOs instead of usury and corruption? Why do they want us staring at our navel instead of challenging the real conspiracies in this world? I see it all the time. "Omg I miss when we used to talk about aliens here." Aliens are science fiction. Why do they want us to spend all of our time on science fiction?
<|endoftext|>It's clear the shills want us wasting our time talking about mythology and science fiction.. how is the one word "criptids" a conspiracy theory? How is this topic even relevant to this sub?Can anyone answer that? Top minds of reddit want us talking about things that do not matter. They dont want us talling about corruption and usury.. no that's no fun. Talk about bigfoot goyim! That's the important conspiracy.
<|endoftext|>My kind of conspiracyRecently this has been a common sentiment when these sorts of topics are discussed, as opposed to political conspiracy, which many are sick of seeing. There are at several categories of conspiracy narratives:* Political/power conspiracies, which can often be sourced and verified as factual* Mystical/fantastical conspiracies, which frame the world as a place bounding with hidden magic (such as this post)* Dark/obfuscatory conspiracies, where the world is a lie or simulation, and malicious beings are hiding the true reality* Historical conspiracy, where the truth about the past is much more interesting than the mainstream narrativeAll of these are valid topics, but are often completely unrelated and I could almost see separate subs for each of them.
<|endoftext|>For me the first footprints found in the Himalayans are big evidence because of how much harder they'd be to fake than in other locations.
<|endoftext|>We have known giant squids have existed since the 1700's whaling ships. Herman Melville knew about them...
<|endoftext|>Take a look at the lusca. Its belived to be a giant octipus that lives in the blue holes and limestone cave networks
<|endoftext|>The Jersey Devil sightings have always fascinated me.Spotted and reported by multiple people within hours, across multiple state lines, and shot at by one police officer.All in a time when information passage was far from rapid and reliable.
<|endoftext|>What's the conspiracy? A systemic cover up? Or a conspiracy to fake evidence of cryptids? Cui bono?
<|endoftext|>Its absolutely crazy to think that someone hasnt tried human cloning. The benefits from even just being able to clone an organ or two would be hugely beneficial. This work has almost certainly taken place even if it happened in secret.
<|endoftext|>I can see some prehistoric stuff still hidden since in the ocean because of the safety it provided.
<|endoftext|>Doesn't it have to be reported and considered rumor for a long time to be a cryptid? Like would you consider some new species of beetle from the rain forest a cryptid?
<|endoftext|>I've combed the seas on Google maps. There aren't city-looking structures anywhere that I've come across. I'd say if **merfolk** are real, they don't live in giant dick-shaped towers on the ocean floor as Disney would have you believe.
<|endoftext|>Those tentacles would certainly look different enough from a squid. Im reluctantly hopeful we discover a giant octo...itd be so boss. Octos are pretty smart too, so it makes you wonder how intelligent a big daddy would be.
<|endoftext|>I believe most if not all female octopi die after giving birth, just something to contribute to this thought... They may not live enough to get as colossal as the/a kraken.

<|endoftext|>Yeah mothman has the most witnesses in such a short time frame - all recorded testimonies too. Kinda freaky
<|endoftext|>For sure! VERY interesting. I like when conspiracies intersect. Cryptids, gov't spooks, possible interdimensional gateways...whats not to love?
<|endoftext|>Serious question: Has there ever been any Form of scientific evidence or notion towards the existence of unicorns?
<|endoftext|>One of the better posts Ive seen here in a longTime. Excellent prose. Concise. To the point. Post more.
<|endoftext|>What do you mean? You can see the [voting here](
<|endoftext|>Yeah, I didn't even see this one, let alone get a chance to vote in it. Don't get me wrong, I love the topic! But I just wish I'd been able to contribute in the nomination post. I feel like normally the nomination post is up for several days.
<|endoftext|>I think people being more gullible in the past is a misconception that is actually the source of many conspiracies and also results in like everything this sub discusses being relegated to "conspiracy theories"
<|endoftext|>This sub had plenty of /r/paranormal-like posts before your time (aka before a lot of the political shitposting started).
<|endoftext|> point exactly.
<|endoftext|>Stop spamming this thread. The topic of discussion is about cryptids. Get over it. Join in the discussion or don't, but either way stop whining about it.
<|endoftext|>The discussion about aliens/cryptids/ufos/etc isn't science fiction. the discussions center around those things being suppressed science fact.the conspiracy aspect is that these things are being supressed by those who know more than we do. why would they do this? and heres a post for us to share what we know that you wont find elsewhere due to that supression
<|endoftext|>[This user does so remarkably well]( I *started* these round tables *precisely* to focus on the esoteric and "high octane" stuff. It was during a time when the board was inundated with political content, and it was drowning out our ability to discuss these fringe theories without being ridiculed and buried for our efforts.The Round Table circumvents this "mainstreamification" of conspiracy theories that TPTB are desperately pushing for...they want people to be conspiracy theorists, but only regarding *their* brand of conspiracy theories.The Round Table doesn't have to solve the world's problem in each iteration. It's meant to keep us true to our conspiratorial and speculative roots.
<|endoftext|>Its certainly not to say that those conspiracies are less important! Really cryptids dont matter that much. Its just a thing ive always been into. Its fun.I love learning new things, i want to know the truth about the world, thats why i come here. But it gets depressing...you can get into a dark place, focusing on all the evil in the world. Cryptids, aliens, ancient civilizations, are very interesting, and are a nice break from all the gov't stuff we usually get. There are a ton of mysteries about the earth that are still not understood. I want to understand, i want to know. Russia gate is a super valid subject, but its been beaten to death here...i made up my mind about it years ago. Know what i havent made my mind up about? Bigfoot, how the pyramids were made, were vimanas real? Its all equally relevant to me.
<|endoftext|>People are sick of seeing political conspiracy because it is often extremely sickening . They are looking for a fantasy instead of those unfortunate (real or feigned) realities.I totally agree all these could possibly have their own subreddit and we all might be more happy for it
<|endoftext|>Well I could see a separate sub for cryptids too, are these being covered up for some reason? is it a conspiracy that they actually exist? why?
<|endoftext|>Sadly (but interestingly), the yeti is likely a himalyan bear-polar bear hybrid. Apparently ancient myths even called the yeti a type of bear...
<|endoftext|>Also check out the Flatwoods Monster from 1952. There were like 7 witnesses to the being on the ground in Flatwoods, another witness who saw it right in front of his car, and at least hundreds of people who saw it's craft flying around. Another one was spotted in another city within the same day. It was basically an alien in a very small auxiliary craft flying around with sparks coming out of it and stuff falling off while it flew over several cities and eventually landed. It left a trail of a strange oily substance. Later on it went into the woods to another craft that picked it up and they zoomed off. One of the AirForce pilots who was involved had his history erased after he died until a researcher found his brother and later the pilot's grave stone. Really crazy story.
<|endoftext|>Meet my friend [George]( Also known as Magnapinnidae squid.
<|endoftext|>For sure, we had just never encountered a live one in modern times or gotten footage like we have now. It was a legendary creature. Scars on whales was evidence already, but it was nice to get some real confirmation.
<|endoftext|>[I found this article from 2001]( Obviously it might be a little dated now but it's basically from the exact period when cloning was all the rage. Legal repercussions for cloning human embryos - at least in 2001 - were from a $1 million fine to 10 years in prison... Considering that the people who'd be most interested in this would be super wealthy and super secret naturally, and the fact their wealth could give them sway over the legal system... That's really not that much to risk for a potentially insane reward...
<|endoftext|>It can still be the last thing you see if youre not careful in warm costal waters. You go in the cage. Cage goes in the water. You go in the water. Sharks in the water. Our shark. 450 million years old, not evolving. Because perfection eats evolution and Darwin for breakfast.
<|endoftext|>Not necesarily if they live very deep and are incredibly rare. We only recently proved a giant squid exists, the ocean is a huge place and we really havent spent much time in the deepest parts. Theres plenty of food down there.
<|endoftext|>Six gill sharks are massive and can survive on only one meal a year. They are on the ocean floor. Source: Blue Planet episode.
<|endoftext|>It gets weirder. I started listening to modern accounts of 'dog men' encounters and there were some recounted by the witnesses themselves which just seemed extremely difficult to disbelieve the honesty of their stories.Listen to this woman's account and tell me if you can see through her act; [
<|endoftext|>Yeah I remember looking at that story before.. like thousands of reports in one day if Im not mistaken
<|endoftext|>Essentially, an alternate theory of evolution allows for a little more [horizontal movement and tangling of genetic lines]( than the clean splits of standard Darwinian evolution models propose. This could allow for a much wider range of genetic diversity.
<|endoftext|>It was up for 2 days, which is the normal length for these...also cryptids won hands down (2nd choice wasn't close).
<|endoftext|>Seeing how gullible a large portion of the popoulace can be currently is all the evidence you need.What makes you think otherwise?
<|endoftext|>Yeah there is nothing wrong with talking about cover ups or academia denying evidence, but the entire field of "ghosts" for example is not a conspiracy
<|endoftext|>But that's not the topic. The topic could have been something like covered up biological discoveries. It could have been something that makes sense in the context of this community but it's not. It's one word, criptids. That's not a conspiracy...
<|endoftext|>I dont post about politics. I post about new speak and the tyranny of censorship. The JQ isn't politics. Its life or death.
<|endoftext|>It never hurts to put it out there...always an off chance that someone could post something relevant or insightful. Hearing user's personal experience is still valuable, whether or not there are pictures or hard proof. Im grateful for these round tables...its a little harsh to call it shilling. People have wide interests, its good to cover all the bases. Keep it up!
<|endoftext|>[This user does so remarkably well]( agree. They actually present a conspiracy theory. They arent saying omg cool freaking squids right on!!!! Maybe the topic should be more fleshed out so that people are compelled to engage with the topic. Idk pretty tough to have a discussion when the topic is presented as one word. Why arent there examples of criptids? Why isnt there evidence. My problem isn't the topic. I love the topic. My problem is how it was presented as one word... idk. RMFN, I *started* these round tables *precisely* to focus on the esoteric and "high octane" stuff. It was during a time when the board was inundated with political content, and it was drowning out our ability to discuss these fringe theories without being ridiculed and buried for our efforts.The occult is a good topic, but it is not inherently conspiratorial. High octane stuff is my bread and butter. I am an occultist.. The Round Table circumvents this "mainstreamification" of conspiracy theories that TPTB are desperately pushing for...they want people to be conspiracy theorists, but only regarding *their* brand of conspiracy theories.But it seems only mainstream topics are presented as round table topics. Idk never had one on the occult nature of being transgender. That would be an epic round table with some very interesting esoteric tie ins.The Round Table doesn't have to solve the world's problem in each iteration. It's meant to keep us true to our conspiratorial and speculative roots.I agree. And I value what you do and I value the round tables. That is exactly why I have the criticism I do. I care about this community. That is why I go about things the way I do. I want people to think for themselves.. idk I guess I should loosen up and have a beer. But seeing people sqeal over UFOs and aliens when there is no connection to the two phenomena just pisses me off..Imho this topic was not presented appropriately for this community. One word like "ghosts" isn't a conspiracy. I think next time we need to get together and we can put a small presentation together to get people thinking about the topic. Thst would be a good round table. We need to foster discussion. Not say "bigfoot, go!"
<|endoftext|>Well it has been pretty much proven that something like 80% of the pyramids were made by Geo-polymer casting, basically it's a form of concrete. Material scientists examined the stones and it was also verified by examining the magnetic alignment in the stones. magnetism in natural stone would be all over the place, but for the pyramids they are perfectly lined up.[ was done like over 20 years ago but the information has been suppressedI guess it might not be considered a wonder of the world and hurt tourism and Egypt, Egyptologists, travel agencies etc might not like that.
<|endoftext|>There are already plenty of cryptid subreddits and some cross traffic. Everyone with an open mind is welcome here.
<|endoftext|>I think it's possibly another hominid/great ape species. Like gigantopithecus or something. Or alternatively, going down a more fringe theory route, it's also possible that the sasquatch could be a generic experiment. If humans were genetically created or modified (think annunaki-style) then it's possible that sasquatch are too!
<|endoftext|>Agreed. Misidientified critters and their tracks.Higher up in elevation snow pack is semi permanent. Tracks in snow are longer lived, slowly eroding over time, becoming larger and less defined, looking like they were made by a much larger specimen.
<|endoftext|> maybe denisovans?
<|endoftext|>From Wiki.Nearly fifty years later, investigators concluded that the light was a meteor and the creature was a barn owl perched in a tree, with shadows making it appear to be a large humanoid.
<|endoftext|>I guess so. Whatever those japanese guys found about 8 years ago...i thought that was the first documented proof, aside from rotting corpses. I could totally be wrong though. I dont mind being corrected.
<|endoftext|>Are you telling me the ancient Greek people hadn't known of a "kraken". These entities are enshrined in folklore. Just because we find them today doesn't mean they were undiscovered...
<|endoftext|>I specifically mean the original sighting, way back in the day.Though I don't doubt other accounts of high strangeness, a la Moth Man.
<|endoftext|>That particular story you linked, I dunno, I *could* believe that. It's a lot harder to tell if someone's lying from voice alone, but despite how her storytelling ability was utterly pisspoor the way she was describing everything sounded very real. The chronological recounting of the events, the way she said she could feel the sounds in her chest, details like that make it very believable. I do honestly think there's something like that out there. I don't think stories of werewolves and dogmen were born purely out of thin air. But I won't be able to fully believe it until I see something myself that truly convinces me beyond a doubt. I was like that with ufos. So yeah, interesting story! Makes me wanna listen to more haha
<|endoftext|>I guess that's a way of thinking but it's still not a scientific approach to a unicorn.I just wondered whether there's any other source than myths and legends.
<|endoftext|>well... I dunno, horses didn't look like rhinos at any given time in evolution, if you can believe what is being taught as such.Anything close to a rhino would be a percheron nowadays :p
<|endoftext|>I thought they were normally up for like 4 or 5 days. Or Is that how long the round table itself is up?
<|endoftext|>she posted about it on Reddit and was exposed, i didn't save the link. also no one goes outside to investigate something theyre so scared of they can barely breath unless its a movie
<|endoftext|>Exactly I don't think it's changed I don't think we are currently any different than any Homo sapiens sapiens have been since whenever
<|endoftext|> but the entire field of "ghosts" for example is not a conspiracyNeither is "wahh this shitty subreddit got banned because *commies or something*" but that doesn't stop those topics from getting posted here.
<|endoftext|>The topic could have been something like covered up biological discoveries.But that's precisely what this is about.
<|endoftext|>Ahuh and how exactly is censorship and tyranny not political you absolute tool. Your post history is strait cringe.
<|endoftext|>It both directly & tangentially relates to a broad range of conspiracy theories regarding the existence & subsequent coverup of certain particular non-human animals/creatures/entities like bigfoot, mothman, human-animal hybrids, chimeras etc.
<|endoftext|>For me its a bigger question of not just the pyramids, but all megalithic structures from antiquity...other sites do have blocks that appear to have been poured in to place, made from a mold to achieve uniformity. But giant multi-hundred ton blocks at many sites still pose the question of how they were to be moved. I wouldnt say its completely solved...that website didnt have a ton of info. In fact it says it was done with advanced technology that was lost...so we still dont know how they did it. Not exactly a smoking gun there.
<|endoftext|>Not what I meant but yea. I like allllll kinds of conspiracies. I was just saying it might be easier for some to sift through when looking for whatever they want to look for.
<|endoftext|>Wikipedia is notorious for downplaying UFO stories. Look into the stories yourself, look at the witness testimony, the second and third sighting of the creature that took place, how some of it was covered up at the time, and all of the surrounding facts. It doesn't matter if some paid off debunker concluded something. That doesn't change what happened.You will be severely misinformed if you rely on wikipedia for UFO stories. Trust me. You can get the facts and the testimony yourself without relying on them. If you want to learn how a UFO coverup works, a classic example that will teach you everything you need to know is the Westall UFO incident.
<|endoftext|>I had one of those Time Life Mysteries of the Unknown books, I used to stare at that pic as a kid like Arnold in Predator...what the hell are you? I know they say it's a rotting whale or shark but since they threw it away who knows.
<|endoftext|>Yeah, that's apparently what a cryptid is. Something that we have accounts of from folklore, but no firsthand sightings. The city of Troy was believed to be fake until they found it. And they still believe Atlantis to be fake. Prob not much different with other things like the kraken.
<|endoftext|>Interestingly enough the kraken has nothing to do with Greece. They did have a see monster called the Scylla which is more of a water dragon thingy, but they never had a giant octopus or squid in their folklore.Scandinavia does and so does Japan though.
<|endoftext|>That's the whole point. Her story telling ability is shit. She tangents off and tells all this BS about things that aren't relevant. But you hear the emotion in her voice when she talks about how she didn't think she could protect her kids. And all the random info after that.2 things; 1. the V shape, like body builders. And the popping sound, like cracking knuckles when they stand full height. I've heard these things repeated almost verbatim in a lot accounts now.I don't know, the guy that runs the channel is doing it for money so it's not impossible the whole thing could be an elaborate scam. Would be good to have people look at diverse accounts to see what commonalities there are.
<|endoftext|>interesting. I was not aware. What do you know about Cryptids during wartime? 
<|endoftext|>Neither is "wahh this shitty subreddit got banned because *commies or something*" but that doesn't stop those topics from getting posted here.Censorship brought about by the coordinated effort of organizations like the adl and splc who are colluding with admins of this website to silence specific types of political speech is literally the definition of a conspiracy...
<|endoftext|>But it isn't. The topic is "criptids". Not the coverup of criptids. There is a difference.. isn't there? I have seen three UFOs in my life. I have seen strange animals in the woods. I have seen 300lb snapping turtles that have 5 ft necks. But that isnt a conspiracy. That's my experience. If I went to talk about my experiences and somone wearing a black suit came to me and said if you talk about that we will have to silence you. Or you'll be sorry now that is a conspiracy... Idk. I think its important for topics to be fleshed out onto a presentation before being used as a round table. One word isnt enough to start a discussion. In college or something analogous have you ever been to a speaking event that was described with one word.. We should treat this like a symposium. :"Criptids coverup how urban academics deny the evidence of rare unidentified animals." Now that is a round table topic.
<|endoftext|>huh? it kind of is a smoking gun .... to the pyramids ....which was the point.Your extrapolating it different structures and sad that it dosen't explain them all??? And no it's not completely solved that's also why I said 80% or so, it's not the humongous mystery egyptologists make it out to be.And WHERE does it say advanced technology that was lost in regard's to moving big stones?? you sure they aren't talking about their geopolymer process?
<|endoftext|>True that. But to entertain the possibility, reports of bigfoot/sasquatch/yeti have been that they at least have some degree of intelligence. Assuming that, then it would be possible they have burial rituals. But obviously that's just speculation.
<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>
<|endoftext|>They know Atlantis isnt fake, they get their fucking knowledge from the remnants of the knowledge of this very civilization. Thats just what us undesirables are told to keep us disconnected from our actual identity/potential.
<|endoftext|>You're saying the Greeks thought Troy was a myth? Just because authority figures from a different culture don't think folklore is real doenst mean the people from whose culture that originated didnt..
<|endoftext|>Reasonable points. It could be made up entirely. I guess we'll never know for certain until we know. Thanks for sharing the link though!
<|endoftext|>So then go back further [when this sub talked about UFOs and shit](
<|endoftext|>Banning a subreddit for doxxing and harassment is not censorship, unless you also agree that banning CNN from this sub for "almost doxxing" is also unjustified censorship. And either way, that's not a conspiracy lmao.
<|endoftext|>Bigfoot is an alien. There have been plenty of reports of Bigfoot sightings where UFOs are present. There have even been waves of tiny hairy beings coming from UFOs as well. They are just another alien species. That's why they can walk around in the woods anywhere on earth and be gone quickly.
<|endoftext|>Immortality is not a thing amongst mammals. Crustaceans and some jellyfish. And some trees. Thats all.
<|endoftext|>It's not about "different culture" it's about being verified in modern history with modern tools ie photography. You are trying to start an argument over nothing.
<|endoftext|>That was 2 sentences of nothing. Thanks for your contribution to the round table.If you let people tell stories in their owns words without coaching they usually tangent and ramble. Her story sounded completely organic to me. If someone with expertise in this field had some input that would be great.
<|endoftext|>How fucking autistic are you? If you can't figure out how it relates to conspiracies *after I just explained exactly how it relates to conspiracies* then I'm not gonna continue this conversation. You're either trolling at this point, or you're literally too stupid to converse with. I'm gonna assume the prior because I'm an optimist and don't think you're actually that stupid. But seriously, either way stop whining and either contribute to the conversation or don't.Wow. Just wow.
<|endoftext|>Maybe aliens are interested in these species as well? Maybe sasquatch is getting anal probed as we speak.
<|endoftext|>What's your problem, dude? You're coming off way too hostile. Chill out, this is an open discussion. I've put in far more than just two sentences elsewhere in the thread (not like it even matters if I hadn't anyway). But more on topic, are you trying to make a specific point here or are your comments moreso on the "simply contributing with information" side of things? Because you're contradicting yourself in your comments and it reads awkwardly. In your first it sounds like you believe her, the second is incredibly critical and dismissive, and then the third you're back to sounding like you believe her.
<|endoftext|>So then we're at the main flaw in your reasoning. That's great you don't like UFOs or paranormal topics, so just leave this thread and wait for the next round table.This is the same logic as me saying "go back to /r/conservative if you just want to shitpost about the right-wing's victim complex".
<|endoftext|>Cause it would (if real) serve as possible evidence for conspiracies about aliens, such as why the sighting was not widely reported (if confirmable)? Not everything on a conspiracy reddit is going to literally be a conspiracy theory from start to middle to end by the strict definition. There are conspiracy tidbits and conspiracy-related topics that can generate conspiracy-relevant discussion. Shit ain't binary, I'm sorry
<|endoftext|>In the last few days? One of their newer mods. An entire album of personal photos and their name. And that's AFTER getting warning after warning for that kind of content.
<|endoftext|>I guess we'll have to agree to disagree if you think they were only banned for a political opinion. However, that's clearly disproven by the fact /r/the_donald, /r/conservative, /r/C_S_T, and more are still allowed to exist without so much as even being quarantined.
<|endoftext|>Maybe they're highly sought after for alien zoos and are snatched up rather quickly, hence why we dont see many...or rather the aliens need them for some kind of medicine or w/e
<|endoftext|>Possibly related to Lenin. Vladimir Ulianovitch Lenin. If you dont agree, youre out of your element.
<|endoftext|>I started listening to modern accounts of 'dog men' encounters and there were some recounted by the witnesses themselves which just seemed extremely difficult to disbelieve the honesty of their stories.  Listen to this woman's account and tell me if you can see through her actHere I indicate that I could not readily disbelieve her account.That's the whole point. Her story telling ability is shit. She tangents off and tells all this BS about things that aren't relevant. But you hear the emotion in her voice when she talks about how she didn't think she could protect her kids.This is a supporting statement. Well rehearsed liars tell good \*stories\* (you said her storytelling ability was piss poor..= not a well rehearsed story). The fact she rambled and went on tangents was, to me, indicative she was being honest.Then you followed up with wishy washy maybe, maybe not.If this roundtable isn't full of shit then it's for intelligent and inquisitive minded people to really investigate the phenomena.My stance on this particular account was: I can't tell shes lying.

<|endoftext|>If you wish to report other users, you're welcome to do so. Also, discussion of other users is appropriate within the meta sticky comment (not elsewhere in a given thread).
<|endoftext|>If you let people tell stories in their owns words without coaching they usually tangent and ramble. Her story sounded completely organic to me.  But then you said that, which went against what you first said. You said that she rambled, said that's normal, said it sounds organic. Some people are just bad storytellers; doesn't mean they're liars. And yes, I'll freely admit that I don't know if it's true or not, because I'm not so arrogant to believe that I know everything based on incomplete information. That's just the smart way of approaching things like that. Stop trying to gatekeep this thread though. You don't have to be all-in, balls to the wall believer or absolute vehement denier. To be either of those is dogmatic (pun not intended lol) and idiotic. To take the middle ground is just wise.
<|endoftext|>Here I'll answer it since you can't seem to come to this on your own. Let's say a UFO is seen that belongs to an ET race and the government knows about it and hasn't told us about it then although it may not technically be a conspiracy because it may not be illegal it can definitely be argued it's immortal which is a core position of this sub that just because something isn't illegal doesn't make it any less of a conspiracy and it should still be discussed here.
<|endoftext|>Oooo so then you can't deny that it'd be harmful to humanity to either not be told the truth of ETs or to not have advanced government technology disclosed that could help us therefore not being told the truth about UFOs is a conspiracy. Glad we agree finally
<|endoftext|>I have reported him multiple times but his comments are still up. And there is no sticky comment in this thread to discuss users. It's a catch-22. One user gets preferential treatment, then other users get their comments removed for calling him out on it. Can you explain why this is the case? It's a clear abuse of power.
<|endoftext|>Haha, what are you talking about? That completely supports all of my previous statements.People who aren't coached, who aren't telling rehearsed stories will often ramble and tangent. Everything I've said supports everything I've said.I apologize if I offended you. I'll let someone else pick up the thread of logic.
<|endoftext|>Okay now that is a conspiracy theory. Just UFOs and just criptids isnt. Academia and the government working together to keep those things secret or hidden is. Do you see the difference?
<|endoftext|>Every user has comments removed if they break the rules; I've issued multiple warnings to multiple users in this thread and else where, as an example.Beyond that, again, if you see a rule breaking comment you're welcome to report it or send us a modmail but replying by attempting to discuss the user themselves is also a violation (and will thus result in warnings for all parties).
<|endoftext|>Do you know what organic means? It means natural. To say that her speech sounded organic is to say that what she said sounded genuine and real, at least from her perspective. She *did* ramble and tangent. Maybe you meant say "inorganic" or "artificial" if your point was that you didn't believe what she was saying? You didn't offend me because I don't know you and therefore don't value your personal opinion. But your arrogance is seeping into your comments and lowering the quality of them, and by extension lowering the quality of the thread. Just trying to help you out here. I'm interested in hearing out and contributing to a quality discussion, not in creating a dogmatic echo chamber.
<|endoftext|>Nope seems pretty similar to me. Good try though. Was that really that hard to come up with by the way? Seems like pretty simple and obvious.

I've repeatedly stated, with referential citations to my own previous statements, that what she said appeared to be true (at least from her perspective), i.e organic.Whatever you're doing is blatantly obvious to anyone that reads this thread.I wish you all the best, into that dark night you plumb.

<|endoftext|>.... I'm not attacking UFOs. I'm attaching the unsubstantiated proposition that UFOs are piloted by aliens.

<|endoftext|>Fact remains that RMFN's rule-breaking comments are still up, but several comments from several users who've pointed this out have been removed. No clever word play on how you apply and enforce the rules can mask that fact.
<|endoftext|>No, I'm claiming there is no evidence connecting UFOs to aliens... UFOs exist and could be a number of things including mythical beings.
<|endoftext|>I think what you're struggling with here is perhaps the idea that a given comment you feel violates the rules may have been adjudicated to not have been a rule violation, but those specific type of concerns are not something we would discuss with third parties.In any event, going forward we would still ask you report such comments (rather than commenting on the user making the comments).

<|endoftext|>Sometimes but not always. You never trust anything said by the government? You don't believe in MK Ultra?
<|endoftext|>I mentioned multiple cases with evidence. If you aren't going to bother researching them then at least don't claim there's not evidence.
<|endoftext|>Have you read Passport to Magonia. Why do faerie myths have eerie comparisons to UFO abductions? How long have people been abducted by these entities? You see? Maybe they have lived here forever. That would make them terrestrial and not aliens.
<|endoftext|>I am familure with everything you asked about. Care to tell me what evidence within those topics proves aliens pilot ufos..
<|endoftext|>Here I'll answer it since you can't seem to come to this on your own. Let's say a cryptid (remember we just did this with UFOs? Might want to see if a doctor if you can't understand how it'd be the same for cryptids) is seen and the government knows about it and hasn't told us about it then although it may not technically be a conspiracy because it may not be illegal it can definitely be argued it's immortal which is a core position of this sub that just because something isn't illegal doesn't make it any less of a conspiracy and it should still be discussed here. I'll mention it again too that something doesn't have to technically be a conspiracy to be discussed here. This sub has been a place people can talk about things that otherwise ridiculed. If you don't like it. Leave
<|endoftext|>No. I don't know. Reportedly for thousands of years. Yes that is possible but it's also possible they are ET. What do you have against that possibly? Also nice job ignoring everything I mentioned
<|endoftext|>You asked for evidence not proof.Betty and Barny Hill - under hypnoregression she recounted her abduction and drew a start map the ETs showed her which included stars not yet discovered. There have been objects in abductees that defy medical explanation (for instance one being attached to the body instead of attacked). Many credibile people in the military and NASA and other groups say they exist.
<|endoftext|>[ I know you seem to have trouble remembering what you just typed.
<|endoftext|>.. what do I have against it? The fact that there is no evidence supporting aliens are connected to UFOs. The most logical answer is government secret projects and technology.
<|endoftext|>Hypnoregression? So under guidance and not with their own memory? You do realize the problems with hypnosis?

<|endoftext|>Ya. I don't believe in it but I think they deserve a place to discuss it. Why do you like censorship?
<|endoftext|>Editted. Weird trolling isn't allowed yet it's not addressed. I apologise for trying to help make this sub better though.
<|endoftext|>I mentioned several reasons to support them being aliens but you've ignored everyone a second time now. Makes it seem like you aren't being genuine.
<|endoftext|>You believe in MK Ultra which the government told us about.... lol. Oh I see. Never heard of pperatopn mockingbird? That's all part of the plan.
<|endoftext|>Naw I've been here for a decade and I'm not leaving. By all means stick up for the user disrupting discussion though that really helps.
<|endoftext|>First I've heard that but wouldn't that go against what your saying? Or are you saying hers are fake and because of that there can't possibly be multiple species? You're extremely vague which makes it hard to take you seriously.
<|endoftext|>**"Have you looked into it? Do you know of the Betty and Barny Hill Case? Do you know of the abduction cases that left objects that defy modern medicine?

<|endoftext|>She had biological material on her dress. She correctly drew the stars the ETs claimed to be from years before they were discovered. Do better research
<|endoftext|>Yes. You questioned me believing anything the government says yet you obviously believe some of what they say too.
<|endoftext|>No a "conspiracy" not a "conspiracy theory"You : Bit you are the one who implied a conspiracy has to be illegal...Yes a conspiracy has to be illegal
<|endoftext|>Then I responded with the book passport to Magonia that describes the fact that abduction cases and faerie folklore are essentially the same.Are they aliens if they have lived here as long as humans?
<|endoftext|>She had biological material on her dress. She correctly drew the stars the ETs claimed to be from years before they were discovered. Do better researchETs? They couldn't be native to this planet? They have to be aliens and not faeries?The Egyptians said they were from the binary star system of Sirius.
<|endoftext|> were the first one to say illegal.
<|endoftext|>Will do. I'm so sorry.Edit: you did tell me to "lurk most" which would suggest you don't want me participating.
<|endoftext|>And I've never heard of that and just because it says it doesn't make it true.If they originally came from space than yes.
<|endoftext|>You said no evidence. That's a form of evidence. I never said it had to be aliens but it's possible. Why don't you think it's possible? Give me one real reason
<|endoftext|>Will do. I'm so sorry.No worries.Edit: you did tell me to "lurk most"*Lurk Moar*which would suggest you don't want me participating.If you continually attack users, it would be better if your *participation* tapered off.

<|endoftext|>[ user claimed a researcher was a shill. Could you remind them of rule 2 please?
<|endoftext|>No they are 2 very different things with different definitions regardless of if you want to acknowledge it.

<|endoftext|>The context was this comment by you "UFOs =/= aliens. That's the conspiracy.." you said conspiracy not conspiracy theory
<|endoftext|>Where is your argument? You literally only posted questions. Which by definition are not arguments.
<|endoftext|>The context was this comment by you "UFOs =/= aliens. That's the conspiracy.." you said conspiracy not conspiracy theory.....................Lol. Wow. Did I say that? I'm so sorry. That must have just been so confusing.
<|endoftext|>The Betty and Barny Hill case and her knowledge of those stars before anyone else. That's not a question
<|endoftext|>It was. If you meant "conspiracy theory" than say it although that wouldn't have made much sense. What you said made more grammatical sense.
<|endoftext|>Then you cant say to be following much of the UFO community. You probably just watched ancient aliens. Oh wait. She was on that show!
<|endoftext|>Aliens have never been brought up in court unfortunately so nope none sorry. Although there's is plenty of testimon which would be admitted inva court case.

<|endoftext|>"All of the perplexities, confusion, and distress in America arises, not from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation." -- John Adams"The government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers. The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the governments greatest creative opportunity. The financing of all public enterprise, and the conduct of the treasury will become matters of practical administration. Money will cease to be master and will then become servant of humanity." ~ Abraham Lincoln"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning." -- Henry Ford"It is absurd to say our country can issue bonds and cannot issue currency. Both are promises to pay, but one fattens the usurer and the other helps the people." -- Thomas EdisonI am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world - no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, a few years after authorizing the creation of the Federal Reserve"Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U.S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it." ~ President Woodrow Wilson 1913The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson.  U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a letter written Nov. 21, 1933 to Colonel E. Mandell House. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them, will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered...

<|endoftext|>For profit banking is not condoned by the prophet. It should be the number one question in our society. But what is is? Its just loaning money.. nay. It is alchemy. Not gold from lead but gold from nothing. Digital gold. The usurer takes the fertile and makes it barren.Usury is alchemy society can be influenced and takenover by money changers. And that has happened well over 111 times in the history of the world. Now credit cards and the student loan structure with insane interest has become a form of modern slavery. How do we get out of this mess without hurting all of the people who are just working a job? Solutions could be emulating the state bank of north Dakota. Of which you should do substantial research, but for example it is a non profit state bank. All of the money earned goes to pay employees and to be used as capital to be loaned out to the citizens of north Dakota. End the fed and make 50 individual state banks. And for larger cities have a city bank.We must realize that capitalism can only work if everyone is profiting, not of people are taking and profiting off of what others produce. Parasitism isn't capitalism. If banks can borrow money from the federal reserve at 3%, why cant we? Why do we have to go through a money changer to get access to capital? In all honesty for profit banking should be outlawed like for profit hospitals were before Nixon. Usury is the problem in our society. Not capitalism.

<|endoftext|>Allow me to explain banks.Banks are not people so never die unless shutdown.Banks loan money and collect interest on those loans. Given enough time a bank will own all.Quick example. Running a poker game the house/bank gets a percentage of every hand. If the players play long enough the bank will have the majority of thelayers money if all it did was play safe hands and fold losers.It's that simple. A rich person dies their assets are distributed to heirs. Breaking up the fortune. Banks never die and continue to amass fortune until the banks own almost everything.
<|endoftext|>The private profit, public losses dynamic is exaggerated by the very low equity percentages allowed by government banking regulations. The bankers have very little "skin in the game".

<|endoftext|>### Let's do some math.One day, Krishna took on the shape of a sage and appeared before the king of a country in what we today know as India and challenged him to a game of chess.The king was a huge chess enthusiast and asked the sage to name his prize in case he won. The sage was a modest man and asked but for a little rice: on the first square of the chessboard, one grain should be placed, two on the second, four on the third, eight on the fourth, sixteen on the fifth and so on, each with twice the amount of the previous square, until all 64 squares were filled.---As is usual in legend, the king, impressed with the sage's modesty, agreed  and promptly lost the game. When he began to pay the sage's prize however, the grin soon dropped from his royal face, and he realized the truth of the matter: his granary ran out of rice very quickly, and a panicked back-of-the-napkin calculation revealed that he owed the sage, in total, 2-1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains  trillions of tons of rice, a thousand+ times more than is produced world-wide each year.People have kept paying back the debt of their king until this very day. [[more]( [even more]( course, in our moden days, with education available to kings and peasants alike, such a mistake could never happen to any of us. It is clear to us, as gamblers, hobby economists and mathematically literate internet natives, some of us coders even, that a function of the form#### f(x)=ab^x is an [exponential]( one, that its rate of increase accelerates continually and after just a few iterations is almost indistinguishable from a straight, vertical line, right?Right?Let us try another thought experiment. A more realistic one this time.---One day, Krishna took on the shape of a sage and appeared in a barn together with a bunch of his buddies to congratulate a young couple on the birth of their first child, a healthy baby boy. They brought a few gifts and the sage played by Krishna gave the father, Joe, a hard-working man, a penny and advised him to bring it to the bank in his son's name at a 5% interest rate.Baby Jesse however, despite the best education a boy of his social class could wish for, and despite his mother being a veritable saint, grew up to be a real fucking pain in the ass of the authorities of his time and consequently didn't live to celebrate his 34th birthday  BUT luckily enough, he had already transferred the bank account to his closest friend Pete and appointed him his legal successor.Pete continued the business they had started together three and a half years ago, which in turn became an empire in its own right (and actually exists to this very day, still serving billions of costumers around the clock and around the world). The bank account was forgotten in the meantime, but a particularly diligent accountant found it just a few weeks ago. As he typed the pertinent formula into his old, trusty pocket calculator however, it suddenly burst into flames.Why would that be?Simple, is it not!?Like our good accountant, we know the [periodic compounding formula]( by heart:#### P' = P ( 1 + (r/100))^nwhere P is the initial principal sum, P' is the new principal sum, r is the nominal annual interest rate, and n is the number of years the interest is applied.---

<|endoftext|>Mortgages, I've been hearing, are literally an instrument that creates credit out of thin air. It isn't real money that you are given except it looks like it to the person who is given this created credit when selling you their house, because it was created in a ledger. If this is true, the money that you took out as a loan on your property was just entered into a ledger somewhere but is not actually sourced from anywhere.If that is true, and this is not something I have any real knowledge on, then the extent of the sham is almost infinitely worse than one might have feared.
<|endoftext|>One thing though to be wary of is that a lot of people talking about this, about the fraudulent money system, are not necessarily wrong, but if you follow them you find that they are pushing gold as an investment.That aside, there was some interesting research done IIRC by a German professor, he was allowed to examine the books of a high street bank. He determined that it is true that money is literally created on a ledger when credit is created for customers by changing some numbers. It's not borrowed against anything. I don't know the ins and outs, as obviously the central bank must require this is controlled. But it is fascinating and does not seem to be a conspiracy theory. You are paying back interest on money that was just created to lend to you.Until I can find his paper, this was quite interesting - [
<|endoftext|>Lending, Interest Rates and Usury in the Byzantine Empire - quite interesting historical essay which goes back to the earlier days. [ roots of Usury goes back further.[ Michael Hudson\[[2]( is right to claim that general debt cancellation was one of the principal characteristics of Bronze Age societies in Mesopotamia. Indeed, there are various Mesopotamian words for these cancellations, which wiped the slate clean: *amargi* in Lagash (Sumer), *nig-sisa* in Ur, *andurarum* in Ashur, *misharum* in Babylon, *shudutu* in Nuzi. "What many people have noticed around the world is the comparative like of weapons back in the Bronze Age, which quite abrubtly ended by the Iron Age. Then everywhere there is built hill top fortifications, showing a dramatic change in society across many nations.My theory is that principles regarding debt cancellation and usury changed towards the end of the Bronze Age, and it was because of these changes that society became war like. Lets say an initial stressor on resources such as a natural climate changed occurred towards the end of the Bronze Age,and along with this increasing Usury.The growing debt sent neighbouring tribal kingdoms into a spiral of conquest \*in order to pay interest baring debts\* and that this created the very violent iron age era.

Can someone confirm this or correct it.1290: King Edward I of England issues the Edict of Expulsion which expelling all Jews from the Kingdom of England.16421651: The English Civil War was a war between the English King, King Charles I, and the English parliament. King Charles lost.1649: King Charles is convicted of treason and executed.1649-1660: England is ruled as a republic.1653: Oliver Cromwell become Lord Protector of England 1657: Oliver Cromwell over turned the Edict of Expulsion and permitted Jews to return to England.1694: The Bank of England is established.
<|endoftext|>"There are two sorts of wealth-getting, as I have said; one is a part of household management, the other is retail trade: the former necessary and honorable, while that which consists in exchange is justly censured; for it is unnatural, and a mode by which men gain from one another. The most hated sort, and with the greatest reason, is usury, which makes a gain out of money itself, and not from the natural object of it. For money was intended to be used in exchange, but not to increase at interest. And this term interest, which means the birth of money from money, is applied to the breeding of money because the offspring resembles the parent. Wherefore of all modes of getting wealth this is the most unnatural." - Aristotle. *Politics* 1.10, 1258b.EDIT: translation had said "of an modes" looked at other versions and it was supposed to say "of all modes..."
<|endoftext|>Imo, the Bank's influence on our lives and society has never been bigger.  Today the global debt is record high: [ In my country our private debt sector is 300% above our total GDP. I do see a global financial crash coming up. Negative interest rates is not natural. It is also interesting that both Russia and China has started talking about bringing back the gold standard - which would be a drastic change of the world economy - the USD would be worthless.&#x200B;I do think our world would be better if we had the same interest rate policies as in Muslim countries - in where paying interest is not allowed (neither is it in Christianity) - but banks would take a % of the company's profit for some time instead. Usery is a lazy and unmoral way of making money, imo. I do not know why we have accepted such an economy with interest and a currency based on nothing. People should really look into Reagan's time when they caused many deregulation of our finance world and suddenly Wallstreet had a bigger playground where they could basically hedge against anything - making out entire economy less stable. &#x200B;The world is not suppose to endure 1 huge financial crisis each 10 years.&#x200B;However, the fight against usury will only be won through revolution.
<|endoftext|>The elephant in the room: no other options. Solving this is relatively simple, too; look how quickly Bitcoin edged its way in. Despite the flaws of Bitcoin it still shows that standard money could become useless almost overnight. Why isn't there a coordinated effort to do just that?
<|endoftext|>I recently found a copy of 'behold a pale horse' by bill cooper at a used bookstore. 'Silent weapons for quiet wars' does a great job of explaining how financial crises are manufactured to enrich the elite...its a difficult and weird book to read due to formatting, but that particular chapter really resonated with me.ECONOMIC SHOCK TESTING"...economic engineers achieve the same result in studying the behavior of the economy and the consumer public by carefully selecting a staple commodity....and then causing a sudden change or shock in its price or availability.....they observe the shockwaves which result....the objective of such studies is to aquire the know-how to set the public economy into a predictable state of motion or change....which will convince the public that certain 'expert' people should take control of the money system and reestablish security (rather than liberty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens are rendered unable to control their financial affairs, they, of course, become totally enslaved...."

<|endoftext|>This isn't even a conspiracy. Just objectively true. Some of the claims made by the "conspiracy theorists" are pretty ridiculous though.

All the while manipulating society into thinking the psychos are what they should aspire for and admire. its weird they can trick decently intelligent people into arguing for the existence of a process that allows people to gain with out contributing in a single way.

<|endoftext|> "The government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers. The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the governments greatest creative opportunity. The financing of all public enterprise, and the conduct of the treasury will become matters of practical administration. Money will cease to be master and will then become servant of humanity." ~ Abraham LincolnThese are not words from Abraham Lincoln. This is actually Gerald McGeer's interpretation of Lincoln's monetary policy from his book [*The Conquest of Poverty*]( (1935). "It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning." -- Henry FordThese are not words from Henry Ford. This is from a 1937 speech by Congressman Binderup, [who said:]( "It was Henry Ford who said in substance this: 'It is perhaps well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.'" I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world - no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.  U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, a few years after authorizing the creation of the Federal ReserveThe first part "I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country." is a [complete hoax]( The words are unknown until the 1950s, 30 years after Wilson died. He never regretted creating the Federal Reserve. The rest of the quote is from the 1913 book *The New Freedom*, published before the Federal Reserve Act was passed. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them, will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.  Thomas Jefferson - in a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Albert GallatinThe first part of this is an obvious hoax since the word "inflation" wasn't used in reference to money until after Jefferson died, and "deflation" wasn't used until *decades* after that. The quote doesn't appear anywhere until the 1930s. The other parts are [somewhat distorted quotes]( from different letters of Jefferson.Hey, /u/Orangutan, you've used these quotes before and been corrected before. You know they are fake, yet you continue to post them. Do you not care about facts?

<|endoftext|> In a strict Free market Capitalist system, even Capital is marketable and that's how the Bankers and super rich Industrialists at the turn of the century rationalized their pitch to Congress and Woodrow Wilson.So despite the US economy being not a strict "Free Market" system at all b/c so much is subsidized, that's the principal that the Private Banking/Lending system managed to get the govt to sign up for when they created the core of the **Federal Reserve** Act was on Jekyll Island in 1910, where Senator Nelson Aldrich met for a week with representatives of the wealthiest men in the world; including the Rothschilds, **Rockefellers**, Morgans, etc. **The Fed** is privately owned by the banks which are owned by those families.It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the [Federal Reserve Act]( after a series of [financial panics]( the [panic of 1907]( led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate [financial crises]( 1\]]( Over the years, events such as the [Great Depression]( in the 1930s and the [Great Recession]( during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System. The House voted on December 22, 1913, with 298 voting yes to 60 voting no. The Senate voted 4325 on December 23, 1913.[\[150\]]( President [Woodrow Wilson]( signed the bill later that day.SO naturally you may wonder why we have these "financial crisis" on the reg.
<|endoftext|>That is correct. No one should be profiting the way the banks are at this point in time.

I use a credit union and soo should anyone who cares about these issues.
<|endoftext|> Not capitalismCapitalism is also a problem simply for these reasons:1) The CEO's at top levels of capitalism have to provide investor returns plus insatiable drive to retain their spot in the marketplace. They NEVER think about increasing wages except for the employees they couldn't live without because again the majority of the spoils go to investors, marketing, CEO & r&d costs even though the lower levels of society do most of the product service consumption.2) When the biggest companies try to think of ways to provide more returns quarter after quarter, year after year it becomes very difficult to maintain growth through product innovation alone...so wages & benefits get cut & the corps try to escape as much tax contribution to society because these huge mega corporations continue raising prices to satisfy above.3) When those multinationals raise prices, cut staff & wages, avoid taxes & export labor to slave wage labor countries & automation prices are still raised for the main consumers who over time are always pushed in downward wage/benefit situation. Investors & revolving CEO's are always elevated.4) The profits made on cheapened production via automation and slave wage labor is often reinvested inother areas such as real estate. Remember at the same time it is more & more difficult for workersto pay a huge percentage of their wage to actually provide themselves with housing, food etc.The top levels of the capitalism pay an infinitesimal portion of their money on food & housing in fact it is often paid for by the corporation who then uses it as a tax write off that isn't available to the public unless they make it to the mid high six figures.5) The highest levels also can afford to constantly lobby/bribe our politicians to minimize their societal contribution while also minimizing wages/benefits like 'right to work' states & slave wage labor.6) Further these corps are always looking for more money makers.....so we end up with obscenely priced medical care, 'convenience fees', private prisons that gouge prisoners, their families & the state.Medical insurance was essentially free until Kaiser Permanente got Prescott Bush boy Richard Nixon into office & turned medicine into a non-transparent pricing mafia. Same thing with Obamacare.Education same thing. Almost free tuition, reused textbooks for decades.... now top levels of administrations are constantly looking to raise their salaries by building shiny new stadiums, gyms & other campus glitter.Capitalism was promised lower prices & innovation. Most of the time we see good features cut out while prices always rise. It's a terrible system for society and incredibly inflationary unless you decide to view it through the governments idea/measure of inflation.Even if you wanted to start a company to be competitive with the big boys you almost always can't because they have created moats through politician bribery to keep you out of their markets.TDLR If the top levels are always raising their prices over time....everyone underneath them has to raise their prices to survive. The top levels have access to low interest loans to expand/survive, while the consumers/workers have no such access to do the same.
<|endoftext|>Doesn't the bible have something to say about usury? And the one time Jesus violently lost his temper...wasn't that about usury?

<|endoftext|>How do we get out of this mess without hurting all of the people who are just working a job?Businesses need to stop privatizing profits and socializing losses. And they need to stop dodging taxes.If these things don't happen there will be global anarchy before 2030.Usury is bad enough, but capitalism isn't exactly pristine on its own. Some parts work others don't.
<|endoftext|>Usury is alchemyI do something for you on my own volition, that will benefit you. You in turn give a portion of that benefit back to me, as an indication of the value that you derived from my time and energy. We have an almost functioning circuit of energy exchange, the exception being that we are supporting Life; as we both arguably derive more value from the exchange than if we had not done it, we *create* value. We (as participants in Life) overcome entropy. If money is supposed to serve as a kind of substitute for this energy, in order to provide a more easy means of such exchanges, it follows that the act of lending money at interest could only result in a net negative exchange. You cannot create something out of nothing, and to *believe* that such a thing is possible is to have faith in a falsehood. Usury is the means by which humanity is enslaved; I cannot repay an Orange loaned at interest, because I must eat. The only other things I would possess to give would be my time and attention, or my labor.The only things of *value* that we possess as human beings is our time and attention. The War (substitute whatever terminology you are most comfortable with) is an endless series of Life attempting to overcome entropy.
<|endoftext|>All major religions not only ban usury but interest as a whole. Interest needs to be removed from our society completely.
<|endoftext|>You were so close to figuring out the problems with capitalism, but you couldn't QUITE get there. Capitalism, on any larger scale, is innately parasitic.

<|endoftext|>Different kind of loans.What you're talking about in terms of Bank loans for the fed is an "overnight rate," meaning the bank is borrowing money and paying it back the next day. The loan is made to help with a liquidity problem.When an individual takes out a loan from a bank, they are generally doing so for a multi-year term.There might be a way for an individual with an LLC to take out a loan from the Fed ... you just have to pay it back in less than 24 hours.

<|endoftext|>So if carpenter Joseph put out U$ 0.01 to celebrate Jesus' birth at 5% interest rate and the Vatican accountant dug up the bank account in 2019, the catholic church would be worth P' = .01(1.05)  U$ 610 today. That's 60 [short scale] Duodecillion Dollars, or 60,000 [long scale] Sextillions!How much is U$ 60,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 in, let's say, gold?At the time I'm typing this, one kilogram of gold is traded at U$ 42,230, so we are talking about 1.410 kilograms of gold. Shit, we're still in the realm of sextillions... we have to think bigger.One sun mass is roughly 210 kilograms. Therefore, the catholic church now owns precisely((0.011.05)42,230)(210) = 715,391 spheres of pure gold, each with the mass of our central star.---What happened this time? A penny isn't _that_ much. And 5% interest rate, we were really modest now, not like that greedy sage; it's not like we doubled the number of grains for each square of our checker board, did we?!? Krishna, you sneaky, little...---Oooops. It seems we overlooked that our periodic compounding formula actually is an exponential function: f(x)=ab^x, where a is the initial principal sum, b is one plus our nominal annual interest rate per hundred, and x is the number of years the interest is applied!By exchaning 1 grain for 1 penny, we have changed nothing at all, and even a decrease or increase would merely shift the curve to the left or right. By decreasing b from 2 to 1.05, we have only changed the rate at which the sum doubles, stretching the curve along the x-axis, nothing else. The same effect  a nearly vertical curve  occurs, just a little later, postponing doom, not preventing it ([see these plots]( doubling time of course isln(2)0.05=13.863 years.It is clear that Krishnas chess board had 2019/13.9  145 squares this time...---The mindboggling absurdity stares you in the face. Unless you are [Richard Price]( moral philosopher, preacher, and economist, who actually thought it was a [jolly good idea]( to have your monetary policy built around this principle: Money bearing compound interest increases at first slowly. But, the rate of increase being continually accelerated, it becomes in some time so rapid, as to mock all the powers of the imagination.  One penny, put out at our Saviours birth to 5 per cent, compound interest, would, before this time, have increased to a greater sum, than would be contained in a hundred and fifty millions of earths, all solid gold. But if put out to simple interest, it would, in the same time, have amounted to no more than seven shillings and four pence half-penny.   ~ Richard Price, "[An Appeal to the Public on the subject of the National Debt]( London 1772, [p. 19]Think what you will of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, but they totally called Price out on his embarassing blunder in [Vol. III of Das Kapital]( (in [chapter 24]( to be precise). At least we owe him this wonderful, if self-defeating, thought experiment we call "Josephspfenning" (Joseph's penny) in my language. ---All this clearly isn't new knowledge. Compound interest posits eternal growth at exponential rate, and unlike all healthy, living things, it follows no saturation function, which inexorably turns it into a dangerous, cancerous thing  sooner or later. It is almost as if there is a reason that cautionary tales like the one from India exist, or that [Judaism]( [Christianity]( and [Islam]( if on nothing else, at least agree on the condemnation of the practice of [  , /usury/]( if it comes to dealings with the infidels of course...)---The criticism has made it into pop culture a long time ago, if you care to notice it.Andreas Eschbach's [One Trillion Dollars]( treats the hypothetical scenario in which a New York pizza driver unexpectedly inherits the wealth of an ancestor who deposited a small amount of money 500 years ago at 4% interest rate.Those of you who aren't [completely uncultured barbarians]( know that Michael Ende's immortal [Momo]( is also actually an essay on usury (his less known, less child-friendly, much deeper and shamanic [The Mirror In The Mirror]( and various interviews make clear that Ende (author of [The Neverending Story]( was a huge proponent of ageing money, or Freigeld/Freiwirtschaft/demurrage/"circulation tax" for these reasons.Most famous amongst you youngsters however may be Futurama S01E06, A Fishful Of Dollars, in which [Fry's 93 cents were turned into 4.3 Billion Dollars by a 2% interest rate while he was in his unvoluntary 1000-year cryo-sleep]( we know something is wrong with the fiat currencies emitted by BIS/IMF/World Bank controlled central banks, but most can't quite put a finger on it, and like all good conspiracy theorists we have until now blamed the state, the shadow government or the reptilian Annunaki banksters. But going forward, we know better. Exponential growth is simply unsustainable in the long run; natural growth follows a saturation function. A currency that inflates like this, ever accelerating, with no mathematical relation to the goods and services and the trades thereof which it is supposed to facilitate, must necessarily crash sooner or later, because we obviously don't have access to 700,000 spheres of solid gold the weight of our sun each; nor are we gods that can wait an eon or two until the descendants of a king who was bad at chess and math have paid his debt in the form of rice pudding offerings. The math is broken, plain and simple.If we're lucky, we get a crash and a currency reform; if we're luckier, we get the currency reform before the crash (German Mark, French Franc, Italian Lira = EURO); but these measures generally only postpone the inevitable, so if we're very unlucky, we get a bunch of Great Wars, but at least we can number them with Roman numerals, just like we do with our Hollywood movies.

<|endoftext|>That is correct. Banks do need to keep a little tiny amount in reserve, somewhere around 3-4% as I recall, but yes the rest is manufactured by putting lines on a ledger.The real rabbit hole is what happens next. You take out the mortgage and give the check to the seller of your house. They deposit the check in their bank. Then, their bank uses that check as 3-4% reserve for writing more mortgages for other people.

A mortgage company that only works in Bitcoin looks at my finances and is happy to lend me what I need.Why wouldn't the mortgage company charge me interest on my loan? How would using Bitcoin as my currency change anything at all related loans and interests rates? Wouldn't the Bitcoin based mortgage company still practice fractional reserve lending?I guess I don't see why switching to Bitcoin, or any crypto-currency would have any effect on "Usury, the Money Changers, and the Alchemy of High Finance".

The acquisitions eliminate jobs and innovation while raising prices for consumers. These acquisitions are financed, even arranged, by the large investment banks.

GE, Campbell Soup, Dell, Waste Management, Kroger, American Airlines, Hilton, Asurion, Cemex are just a few. Others were financed aiming to build monopolies with debt Netflix and Uber.
<|endoftext|>1-4) You forget that labor itself is a service. If other companies pay more, then your workers will quit and you won't be able to hire more unless you lay more. The answer to low wages is to increase the job market, and then higher wages will be needed to retain workers.5) This is a problem with government, not capitalism. Communism, socialism, and monarchies all suffer the same problem.6+) Each of these issues arose when government starting tinkering with a well functioning capitalist system. Kaiser Permanente got *government* to make changes that are destroying our health care systems. KP couldn't do it, only the government could do things like this.

It's quite long but that's because it covers EVERYthing. Very interesting if you're into that stuff.
<|endoftext|>Im fairly sure that Christianity and Islam not only ban usury, they ban interest completely whether it be high or not. What I read is that Judaism also bans interest but only among Jewish people, so they are allowed to deal interest to non-Jewish people.

<|endoftext|>You have it flipped around. When I buy something, I value it more than I value the money. The seller values my money more than whatever they sold to me.Both people walk away from a free market transaction feeling they made the better end f the deal. And, since value is subjective, both people are more valuable.How can it be exploitation when both sides walk away with more value?
<|endoftext|>That is a totally different issue. Overnight rates are generally used by banks settling accounts between themselves. The global standard for determining interest rates on these loans was called 'LIBOR' - the London Interbank Offered Rate. As it turns out, the banks involved in setting the LIBOR rate had scammed the entire system.  low-level fall guy went to prison)--In longer time frames, banks operate using a fractional reserve system - where they must be able to repay a 'fraction' of the loans they underwrite. Banks preserve this ability by buying up guaranteed assets like T-Bills. To simplify, a bank has a license to buy $1B in T-Bills, and then can offer $20B in loans. The 2008 crisis was caused because of a core problem - while T-bills are guaranteed, they aren't that profitable. So instead they figured out a way to bundle mortgages together, to create something that was *almost* as guaranteed to payout as a T-Bill. But what they'd really done was create a license to certify garbage as being gold.

<|endoftext|>Because bitcoin is deflationary. It becomes more rare over time. The interest rate the bank charges needs to be greater than the rise in value of the underlying currency.Else why not just hold bitcoin?Nobody with any sense will take out a loan of bitcoin for 10 years with a term that requires paying back *more * than you borrowed. Think about it. How has bitcoin changed in 10 years?If you took out a $50 loan in bitcoin 9 years ago, you would never be able to pay it back today.If you bought $50 in bitcoin 9 years ago and held it, you would be independently wealthy today.(Where will bitcoin be in another 9 or 10 years?)

<|endoftext|>Bitcoin does not become rare over time; as I understand it, the rate of \*new\* coin creation goes to zero, but the existing number of coins doesn't go down. Effectively, there is a cap on the max number of bitcoin in circulation.That said, I think you are correct that bitcoin is deflationary. However, does the value of the limited currency rise over time or does an economy using the limited currency just stagnate? If the situation is as you suggest: "Nobody with any sense will take out a loan of bitcoin", how do new businesses get funded? How do consumers purchase homes?Be careful thinking the rise in bitcoin price (versus the US dollar) over the last 9 years has anything to do with the real underlying value of bitcoin; it looks like nothing but a speculative currency bubble to me. It seems to me that the actual value of a bitcoin should be the size of the economy using bitcoin divided by the number of bitcoin. (That should be true for any fixed quantity currency.) What is the size of the "bitcoin economy" today? I have no idea. But if you can value it, you may find whether "bitcoin valuation" is correct, way too high, or way too low.Once bitcoin becomes the currency of the country, its value will be "correct". At that point, the only way the value will change is if the economy grows. And there is the rub. Can an economy based on a fixed quantity currency actually grow?
<|endoftext|>most SEA countries have a living standard equal to the West at a fraction of the price, and with a fraction of the debt to gdp levelRussia and China have respectively 11 and 18 % debt to gdp, but they're harder to get in
<|endoftext|> Bitcoin does not become rare over time; as I understand it, the rate of *new* coin creation goes to zero, but the existing number of coins doesn't go down. Effectively, there is a cap on the max number of bitcoin in circulation.The number of bitcoins in circulation is lost due to attrition. Lost wallets can never be recovered. People receive bitcoins on cell phones, the phone gets dropped in the ocean or lost. People throw their computers away not realizing the value of what was on it. People die and don't tell their children or lawyer where the private key is. Or they get dementia and forget the key (or where it is). All kinds of ways, but once the private key is lost, the coins are lost. However, does the value of the limited currency rise over time or does an economy using the limited currency just stagnate?Both. The value rises and the economy stagnates. If the situation is as you suggest: "Nobody with any sense will take out a loan of bitcoin", how do new businesses get funded? How do consumers purchase homes?They don't. Well, for the time being, you just need to hold bitcoin for a few years and then you can start your business or buy your home. But eventually bitcoin will be a global phenomena and the price will not go up so much, I confess I have no idea when this will be but we are still very, very early in the lifecycle of this technology. Ask people on the street whether they want $1 or 1 bitcoin, most will pick the dollar.In a deflationary economy, wages and prices are driven down because the money is becoming more valuable over time. It is preferable to save money rather than spend it. This means less businesses, less building, less corporations.Most people will say this is a bad thing. I say this is a good thing: because it will sharply curtail the overconsumption of nonrenewable resources which is causing global warming and mass extinctions. If we want a habitable plant for our future grandchildren, a deflationary economy is how to get there.We will have houses, mind you. But they will built out of renewable resources, and families will build them with their own labor. It seems to me that the actual value of a bitcoin should be the size of the economy using bitcoin divided by the number of bitcoinIs gold valuable? Is the value of gold determined this way? (I am aware that bitcoin is not gold, obviously, but bitcoin has its own features which do make it inherently valuable apart from the speculative rush, so the comparison is not inappropriate.) Once bitcoin becomes the currency of the country, its value will be "correct". At that point, the only way the value will change is if the economy grows. And there is the rub. Can an economy based on a fixed quantity currency actually grow?Flipped question: does an *inflationary* economy actually grow? The numbers get bigger, yes, but is there more value being created, or is it just numbers being printed?The value of an economy is not simply the value of the money used, but also the value of the good and services provided and created in that economy. A deflationary economy can grow, but you have to look at the whole picture and not just the total summation of the currency.
<|endoftext|>In order for there to be true capitalism, according to classical liberal principles, the issuing monetary organizations/authorities must at least be partially private, preferably as private as politically tolearble in a soi disant democratic society (the maximum level of de-governmentalization is of course the technically preferred option among genuine capitalists).

<|endoftext|>Your suggestions are risible at the national, let alone international level, as authorities of the caliber of Greenspan have definitively argued for decades. Needless to say I agree with Dr. Alan Greenspan, but far more importantly so does President Trump and the entirety of his economic team. Indeed, there simply is no other option this side of the world of fantasy and socialist science fiction. The reason is quie simple: majority rule is neither politically nor economically trustworthy, quite the opposite, it is a direct recipe, at the national stage undoubtedly, for mob-rule, such as is on display to disastrous effect in Venezuela presently (which, btw, is also the reason Jefferson could never have conceived of such a fantastical notion, let alone endorsed it!).
<|endoftext|>You agree with Greenspan? That's one of the most laughable statements ever uttered. The man ushered in a disgustingly terrible economic crash. He is incompetent and corrupt. A bastard.
<|endoftext|>You really need to bust out some history of economic thought textbooks and educate yourself a little bit on the fundamentals before you go off online mascarading like you have a serious opinion on the matter.

<|endoftext|>Not sure how these round tables work but I hate big pharma and here is why.A few years ago, I worked for a political communications company. We were working with a client to oppose a candidate running for a statewide office. His only experience had been working at a fancy law firm. He was running on an easy platform of protecting seniors from scams, looking out for kids, and fighting the opioid epidemic which had ravished his state hard. As we researched his law firm, we found that they had represented a major pharma company that produced opioids. I thought, this is great, we can kick out one of the three legs of his platform and in a tight race, that can really make a difference. I included it in the research report which is essentially a strength and weakness assessment. We submit the report to the client and schedule a briefing with them. The client reaches out to us to ask us to remove the representation of the pharma company from the report because they are a donor. Now what really pissed me off was that the client was an association that was associated with one political party. There is a similar association that represents this specific segment for the opposing party. When I looked into it, not only was the pharma company a donor to our client, but they are also a donor to the association connected to the other political party. So neither party or candidate would really be able to attack on this issue in a significant way because as a donor, they would shut down any attacks that even tangentially dragged them into the mud. This was the first time I realized that certain industries are above it all and the idea of two party rule is really just for our entertainment so we can pick a team to root for.
<|endoftext|>The modern opiate epidemic seems strangely familiar to the crack epidemic of the 1980's. As we all know, it is accepted FACT that the CIA was behind allowing crack to overtake US inner cities. This, coupled with bullshit mandatory minimum sentences for crack that were significantly higher than those for powder cocaine, resulted in our prisons filling the brim.Now we see the opiate epidemic scourging across the country, with a main focus being on New England and Appalachia. Incarceration does not seem to be the goal here - instead it seems to be extermination. The death rates from opiates are INSANE.Who is behind the current opiate epidemic? What is the end goal? Is it profit, or something more?Why did the federal government [ignore]( Federal scientist's warnings in 2006 of the upcoming opiate epidemic?
<|endoftext|>Anybody else think we should be including the dynamics of the false flag and state cover-up in this round table?  Have we learned anything since the Aurora theater shooting?
<|endoftext|>I agree I think it's a combination of specific conditions. Specific brains and drugs combined with certain psychiatric instututions or doctors who are aware and know how to push and lead people in the direction that is wanted when they are the most vulnerable. I have thought about this theory for awhile and I am not convinced that the medication itself is purely a factor but more so specific individuals pre disposed to have a likely violent outburst if put on the right medications
<|endoftext|>What also should be looked into is how these drugs affect people and suicide rates. My neighbor was on a psychotropic drug and committed suicide. It is not just violence against others but to themselves as well.
<|endoftext|>This is what contributes to school shootings, in no particular order:status at school, bullying, situation at home, diet, exercise, medication.Guns are just the tool they use after becoming sufficiently deranged.It's possible the government is also tipping these vulnerable individuals over the edge through MK-ULTRA or poisonings. I believe they are satanic and cause suffering for fun, but they also get the benefit of taking away our guns.I also believe government black site technology is 50 years ahead of the mainstream, roughly. So god only know what other tools they may have to manipulate the mind.
<|endoftext|>I took psychotropic drugs for schizophrenia starting when I was in middle school all the way to December of this year. It turned out I was misdiagnosed and wasn't suppose to be taking medicine at such a young age. The drugs I took was risperdal, seroquel, amitriptyline, and something else. If you have any questions about psychiatry industry and the effect of the drugs ask a way.

<|endoftext|>We all know that opiates are the feel good Rx for this generation. This may seem reckless but I believe that if many of these dumb, sick ass kids were using opioids or benzos instead of SSRIs there would be more people alive today. This is not in any way a defense of big pharma flooding certain southern states with Oxycontin. They knew what they were doing was reckless endangerment. However I've been a moderate user of opioids for over a dozen years, since childhood, because of health problems They definitely melt the mental problems away. A big issue now is that people who were on high dose opioid maintenance, aren't just turning to heroin that can be spiked with fentanyl to ease their physical and emotional pain. They are also buying pharmaceuticals off the street that are often counterfeited. High profile deaths involving counterfeit pharms include Prince and Lil Peep. In low-moderate doses benzos and opiates relieve mental pain without changing brain chemistry. Yes both are habit forming and addictive. I'm dependent on benzos not opioids because of having a long term prescription for benzos. MDMA, Ketamine, Ayahuasca, and Psilocybin all have shown promise as adjuncts to psychotherapy. CBD has promise. Basically everything but common antidepressants are more trustworthy in my eyes. I also use Kratom which is a SE Asian plant that stimulates both opioid receptors and is a CNS stimulant. It's in the coffee family of plants. The FDA/DEA want a federal ban on it, but Big Pharma also wants to patent the alkaloids in the plant so they can tweak the molecules to make new painkillers. Fucking leeches.

<|endoftext|>Anyone else thinks that theres a higher power causing these mass shootings? Like there powerful politicians with a lot of money paying people to commit these shooting so that laws changes and favors their political campaigns? Some must die for the greater good and all.
<|endoftext|>Hasn't almost every mass shooter been on some type of prescription pharmaceutical? Big Pharma doesn't want us to be healthy because then we wouldn't need drugs. The whole purpose and design of the medical system is to insure a monopoly for these mega-corps. Otherwise people would be allowed to grow cannabis freely in every state.

<|endoftext|>Its called disassociation, and its a state that can separate emotions from your identity. You are cool, calm and collected.
<|endoftext|>In relation to the opioid epidemic, Its easy to point the finger at Purdue as the largest opioid manufacturer.  But equally if not More-so to blame are the three large pharmaceutical distribution companies: McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health.  They are 7, 10, and 16 respectively on the Fortune 500 to give you an idea of how massive these companies are (for reference, Pfizer is the top pharmaceutical company on the list at 61).  These are the companies that had insight into which pharmacies were selling proportionately way too many opioid prescriptions and could have raised red flags but didnt because profits. Purdue just supplies demand - they dont track the drugs. These companies own the supply chain and DID/DO have the ability to see (e.g.) why a pharmacy in a town of 20,000 people is filling 1,000 prescriptions a month for OxyContin. But instead they let their own bottom line grow and did nothing.  Also a fun fact - YOU are probably a partial owner of these companies. What do I mean? I mean their largest shareholders are retirement fund/investment banks like Vanguard and State Street and Blackrock who manage tons of 401ks and pention funds.  If you want to make even the tiniest tiniest difference in the opioid epidemic, call your companys retirement plan provider and say Id like to invest in a fund where McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health are not part of the portfolio. It will probably be extremely difficult to find - when they ask why, say I hold those three companies largely responsible for the opioid crisis and as an issue thats important to me I dont want my money funding them.  Your money wont make any difference, but the more people at Fidelity or TransAmerica, or State Street who hear this the better. Maybe chatter will swirl the halls a little bit and theyll start to both look into alternative plan options and theyll do some research themselves and wake up a little bit.
<|endoftext|>For the sake of clarity, I think it would be nice to define the terms of each round table.What I mean here is, when we talk about mass shootings, what are we talking about?Cartel wars? Gang wars? Black Ops? Solo shooters? I wonder the same about psychotropics.I know this might sound pedantic, but once you know the trivium, you really can't stop applying it to everything. Grammar comes before logic.
<|endoftext|>Sooo ... this is the 60th comment on this page so far, and not one has mentioned vaccines. I wonder why that is.Did you know about the US government's vaccine court and associated program, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)?[
<|endoftext|>Psychotropic drugs dont cause a person to research and buy guns, armor, and ammo. They dont cause a person to combat train with weapons. They dont cause them to recon potential target areas to find places where they can maximize damage or attention. The notion that these mass shooters roll out of bed one day and decide to shoot up a mall is straight up foolish, as is blaming drugs or mental health.

<|endoftext|>I don't think the opiate epidemic is from the US government the fentanyl inpouring originated with the silk road. One vendor got shut down or stopped no ones sure and a guy selling fent from china popped up and then chinese scientists started making analogs. And fent was cheaper easier to make and easier to ship because its potency allowed smaller packages to be more profitable. Not to say that pharma and the opiod pain pills being turned for profit werent an issue leading to the rise of the fent. The government is complicit in that and the epidemic as a whole but not the massive deaths. Slash this year they seem to have got the number of deaths back down. But i dont think the FDA and big pharma envisioned fent they arent even making money off of taking over. In fact im positive there goal was to continue making money and the chinese fentanyl and analogs are really fucking them up.They dont make money off a dead addict.
<|endoftext|>The other problem no one seems to address is that there are doctors who keep prescribing these drugs to people whether they are addicted or not. The local doctors are middle men in a drug related enterprise. A lot of these doctors know it, they could care less, in fact most doctors have an arrangement with a major pharmaceutical company to prescribe only a particular companies drugs in exchange for a cut of the pie so to speak. And remember these companies have drugs for every type of ailment.
<|endoftext|>The death rates are so much higher because of mixing them with too much benzos(or other drugs that effect respiration) and because so much stuff has some level of fentanyl, or analogues of it. Most of the heroine youll find in the Northeast will fentanyl in it, and its becoming even more popular that 15, 20, or 30mg oxy/roxy are pressed pills that have fentanyl in them. Its pretty hard to die directly from just taking oxy or even heroine(although if youre IVing it then its a lot easier) unless you just go and take a ton without having any tolerance. With a tolerance, you have to really take a shit ton of JUST actual oxy/heroine to OD and die.
<|endoftext|>I do. Some of these shootings stink. They're leaving these manifestos that just happen to fuel the media frenzy. People report not only multiple shooters but men in black body armor. [Apparently this vid was taken at parkland]( and a teacher SAID she saw a man that looked like an armored officer doing the shooting when she looked outside her classroom.
<|endoftext|>What we learned is fence sitter, wannabe, lonely, hateful white dudes are watching the TV news. All they need is a 24 hour non stop mass media coverage of every single mass murder shooting to inspire them.
<|endoftext|>An angle that I don't see covered in a lot of these is how the FBI actually is complicit in a lot of these events by finding depressed, or sometimes even mentally unstable young people (generally young men) that they themselves work on radicalizing and providing weapons to (sometimes fake, sometimes real) as an entrapment scheme. I sort of suck at explaining these things so here's an article that shows what I'm talking about. There was another one I saw on here a few weeks ago where the feds preyed on someone that they knew was a schizophrenic that I'll try to find.[ Found the article: [
<|endoftext|>I can agree with you, especially the last part. As far as sedative drugs (used to put someone under), men often wake up more aggressive and women are more emotional.
<|endoftext|>How hard was it getting off of them and did you experience withdrawals in any way? What made you want to stop taking them and were worried about what would happen if you did?
<|endoftext|>Holy shit, that's a lot of drugs for a kid... Can you eleborate? I'm curious on a professional level as I am a recently graduated psychologist and convinced many kids are put on unnecessary medications... At what age where you diagnosed with schizophrenia and for how long? What is the diagnosis now? (if there is any...) Did you get all those medications through one psychiatrist or doctor? Did they test you or just followed the story your parents told them? Now that your off of it, how are you feeling?So lot's of questions here... Hope your doing better now!

<|endoftext|>I'd like to see your evidence that psychotropics don't alter minds...? It's well-established that high levels of seratonin is disinhibiting.
<|endoftext|>Yes. It's not about "believing" whether drugs can modify behavior to do extreme acts because that's a fact, but rather if they are intentionally giving people the drugs with the hopes of triggering them through psychological conditioning. There have already been many cases of kids doing violent acts such as a 16 year old that stabbed his friend to death while on SSRI's. [ The boy, who had no history of violence, had been taking Prozac for three months, during which his parents observed a marked deterioration in his behaviour and mood, which included acts of violence and self-harm where previously no such signs existed.   Over a 10 year period, up until 30 June 2011, more than 40 adverse events of self-harm and violence, including suicides, homicides and suicidal or homicidal ideation, for Fluoxetine were reported to the Australian Therapeutic Drugs Administration
<|endoftext|>Have you seen the michelle carter doc? They clearly make people crazy. If they can induce suicidal thoughts its not that far fetched to think they could cause homicidal ones.
<|endoftext|>Probably a large number of factors cause mass shootings, but yes, it is likely that these drugs are a component.I mean drugs altering behavior is not a hidden side effect in a lot cases, hence the 'suicidal thoughts' provision in like every single drug disclaimer.

<|endoftext|>Sandy Hook is the most blatant false flag imo. From teachers (and the principal) coming back to life, charities created a couple days before the event, the medias pictures/video of the event clearly taken in a different season than December, the school being shut down in 08 due to asbestos (not open since), the school being in clear disrepair in crime scene photos, Newtown getting a $50mil grant from the state to build a new school after it happened (tore down the old school), no blood/smears and no real crime scene pics, bullet holes obviously made by a cordless drill (didnt even bother vacuuming), and dozens more continuity errors in the report. Thats not even getting to the characters in the story. Im not even 100% sure Adam Lanza was actually a real person. Look up the free e-book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook by Jim Fetzer, goes through all the documented facts that we know (and some speculation) by a group of very smart people. Pretty wild shit.
<|endoftext|>You know at this point Im skeptical almost immediately when a major event happens. Theyre controlling the narrative, discussion, economy, military and to a degree even the freaking weather. They have enough control its easy to believe theyre the cause of a lot of the atrocities we see (or dont see). God I sound like a battered wife talking about their abusive husband.
<|endoftext|>Yea, I am a prime example of a kid put on medicine, because parents dont know how raise them. I tried telling my parents for years that the doctor misdiagnosed me, but they didn't want to listen.
<|endoftext|>I got off my medications cold turkey which you're not suppose to do... I definitely felt withdrawals it made me have a weird sick feeling, irratible, depressed, and constant non-stop thinking(racing thoughts?). It wasn't really difficult for me to get off the medication despite side effects. The reason I stopped taking the medication is that I realized the psychiatrist misdiagnosed me. So, once I turned 18 basically told my parents to fuck off and stopped taking it. My biggest fear was having a psychotic break by stopping the medication. Since, my shitty ass psychiatrist engrained that in my head.
<|endoftext|>I was diagnosed in 8th grade, so around 13 or 14? Which from my understanding is way too early to get diagnosed with schizophrenia. I was diagnosed for 5 years. They never tested me actually just followed my parents and I story. Which I still don't know how he thought it was schizophrenia. I tend to get suicidal thoughts when stresed out and my brains a bit slow. Actually, have a couple questions for you, if your parent is mentally slow will it pass down to the child? How is my brain affected for being on drugs so long at a young age? Like will I have any mental problems now going forwards? My real diagnosis was olfactory reference syndrome which I have gotten over.
<|endoftext|>Sure I agree but the timing is terrible, the Feds are bleeding right now. We need to pull this thread with all we have.
<|endoftext|>Youre talking about the guy who drinks a fifth and shoots himself in the head. I will repeat, there is no drug that causes anyone to carefully plan and train for a mass shooting. Hell, if there was one the military would have boatloads of the stuff.
<|endoftext|>It's the fact we lost the single family income during the Reagan era. If we could afford to have one parent at home spending quality time with our children instead of dropping them off at daycare working 60 hrs a week it would help. This was all by design. The daycares are subsidized by the government. I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with daycare but we don't really get a chance to really bond with our kids. The weekends are a frenzy of getting shit done we couldn't tackle during the week. These kids get all their information off a screen.
<|endoftext|>Who benefits from these shootings? The people who want to take your guns certainly do. Additionally, people who want to have an endless supply of crazies benefit from the vilification of drugs that have been clinically proven to fix crazy. Id start [there.](
<|endoftext|>You need to read Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism ! Fisher has an entire chapter devoted to this idea - that mental illness is a societal ill caused by the consequences of neoliberal capitalism, and that placing the onus on individuals is a way to perpetuate this system without blame. There are other philosophers who speak to this as well - check out Deleuze, for example.
<|endoftext|>Wasnt there a compound in el paso training kids for school shootings recently and the FBI demolished the place?
<|endoftext|>I was looking into this one for the first time this past week. What do believers of this theory make of the parents of these kids on video going off on Alex Jones, all angry at his comments, etc.? Like the wife of the "Let's Roll" guy on the plane during 9/11 (a story that seemed utterly false from day one), it's hard to imagine how they fake this stuff.
<|endoftext|>Yeah I was thinking of NM. I will echo your sandy hook take because I did read the book "Nobody Died At Sandy Hook" which has become hard to find - even amazon removed it from their platform. But the information is more than compelling for all the reasons you mentioned. Also Adam Lanza's mom and the blood on her bed magically disappeared in one of the pictures, AND they had a crime scene photo that showed the front door of the school hadnt been broken into yet. Also I checked out that sandy hook website on the wayback machine and [notice the activity coming to a halt in 2008]( Not only that, but you see that sliver in 2010, in that snapshot the website shows it hasnt been [updated since 2008]( (bottom of screen). Probably because the school was fuckin closed lol.
<|endoftext|>What evidence would you need to agree that it wasn't a false flag and actually happened the way everyone says it did? What would prove to you that it was a real event and not a hoax? I lived near Sandy Hook for ten years of my life and I'm just genuinely curious.
<|endoftext|>From the [*Connecticut Post*]( on May 31, 2019 is the the latest news about Paul Fox, Adam Lanzas psychiatrist:	Adam Lanzas psychiatrist is facing 18 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a teenaged female patient.The article goes on with a little more detail:State police detectives investigating the Sandy Hook tragedy later interviewed former patients of Fox and uncovered sexual allegations against the psychiatrist, according to court documents.A then 18-year-old Western Connecticut State University student, identified as Jane Doe in court records, had begun seeing Fox in 2011 for treatment of depression and an eating disorder, authorities said, and at some point, he began having sex with her.**The woman told investigators about the sexual relationship, saying she was drugged up and out of my mind on a cocktail of prescription drugs Fox prescribed, court documents state. The sexual encounters occurred at his Brookfield office and on a sailboat, he kept at Candlewood Lake, documents show.****Fox later surrendered his medical license and moved first to New Zealand and later Maine.**\*  \* **Fox moved to New Zealand first,** ***then*** **he surrendered his U.S. license** ***after*** **securing employment in NZ as a psychiatrist for the Waikato District Health Board in June 2012. He was de-registered by the New Zealand Medical Council in February 2014 after practicing for 19 months without ever disclosing any complaints or charges filed against him. During that time Fox treated Nicky Stevens, the son of a local politician in NZ named Dave Macpherson. Nicky died while under psychiatric care. It is unclear when he moved Maine, but he was arrested there at his home on April 20, 2016 and charged with three counts of second-degree sexual assault.**Moved is a funny way to say he fled the country! But what does this have to do with Lanza?A report issued by the Office of the Child Advocate in November 2014 said that Lanza had Asperger's syndrome and as a teenager suffered from depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, but concluded that they had "neither caused nor led to his murderous acts."Fox told detectives in a Dec. 17, 2012, telephone interview that **he had destroyed any records he had of his treatment of Lanza** but recalled last seeing him when Lanza was about 15. He said the teen was very rigid  resistant to engagement and recalled that he had aggression problems, police said.An assessment by the psychologist at Newtown High School refers to an evaluation Fox did of Lanza in September 2005, according to police reports.If Fox last saw Lanza in 2007, he destroyed those records two years too early according to the records retention laws of Connecticut (19A-14-44). He was supposed to retain all medical and billing (which hadn't been destroyed, but stored back in the U.S.) information for patients for seven years after the last date of treatment, but instead he had them destroyed prior to his departure for New Zealand in 2012.&nbsp;Edit: The paragraph in bold detailing a sequence if events regarding his move to New Zealand and back. Probably some grammar and punctuation fixed, too, but probably not all.
<|endoftext|>Never researched sandy hook too much but wow, I'll have to look into the book. I think Vegas was another one that was clearly blatant as well.
<|endoftext|>The book is hard to find due to a successful lawsuit to stop it being published/take it down online where they can. Interestingly enough, the Publisher of the book has been quoted as saying he now believes the event happened. As has specifically apologized to one of the family members called out in the book, as well as the others.   The books publisher, Dave Gahary of Moon Rock Books, also agreed to stop selling the book as of June 30 in a separate settlement. He said that after meeting Mr. Pozner in May and hearing his story for himself, he now believes him. **My face-to-face interactions with Mr. Pozner have led me to believe that Mr. Pozner is telling the truth about the death of his son**, Mr. Gahary said. I extend my most heartfelt and sincere apology to the Pozner family. source -  The author of the book also admitted to using false information in the book during the court case   **Fetzer actually argued in Court that the original reasons he called the death certificate a fake were untrue**, but then went on to claim that because many variations of the death certificate had been released (including with and without an embossed seal, with handwritten numbers at the top, or with a redaction of the social security number) that the certificates were fabricated. Handwritten differences and variations in the seal on the death certificate was apparently sufficient evidence for Fetzer to claim that Noah Pozner didn't exist.  Source -   Honestly, I have read a lot on this, from both sides. There are some majorly weird things about the case, and I don't know what to believe.
<|endoftext|>They arent even trying anymore because they know they dont need to-- people are so conditioned to believe the govt wouldnt commit these atrocities against their own people. Even with mountains of evidence, they refuse to believe
<|endoftext|>Mass media plays the largest role. They promote violence to generate fear, to introduce more surveillance, security and police.
<|endoftext|>Congratulations on your freedom and thank you for sharing that. You still see the same psychiatrist? Have you connected with any that try to avoid pharms?

<|endoftext|>Yeah I tend to lean more toward the growing disbelief in God as the main cause, which certainly ties in with what youre saying.
<|endoftext|>I don't think you are. I couldn't wish you the best if you didn't post. I couldn't tell you that I share the same frustrations just about different topics. That we're *not* alone in this feeling and that it's just these restless times with unresolved conflicts looming on the horizon. Change doesn't happen over night, it's the resolve to *hope* for a better future and working towards it and even you, here publicly declaring that you don't want to actually fight, but that you are frustrated is important. It allows us to find each other. It's honesty and truth and all that is good about people.cheers mate, hope you have a good one
<|endoftext|>Not sure about the 9/11 one you mentioned, but some of those parents have backgrounds in acting which leads people to think theyre crisis actors. Im not sure exactly what I personally think about them though, its a lot to take in.
<|endoftext|>Yes!! There is so much more were not even touching on here. Oh and the blatantly (and extremely shittily) photoshopped class pictures. Oh and how they found the gun he supposedly shot himself with in Adams trunk? Wayne Carvers bizarreness was a spectacle also. He didnt know what the fuck was going on.Im not entirely convinced about the supposed dead kids singing at the super bowl, but those kids look VERY similar to the photos of deceased children shown on the news. Ultimately I dont think its completely provable.
<|endoftext|>Good question! This might seem like a cop-out answer, but I'd like all the points the book brings up refuted. I saw a [blog post]( that attempts to refute some claims in the book. They do bring up fair points, but they're misrepresenting what was said in the book by its authors, and they're not touching on a ton of other physical and crime scene evidence. For me, I'd like to know why none of the children supposedly killed are listed in the Social Security Death Master File. It's like these kids never existed. Why does the the FBI (as of Sept. 24, 2014) report that no children died in Newtown in 2012? Why are the police saying that NONE of the 154 bullet fragments they recovered (154, more than 5 standard AR mags to kill less than 30 ppl) can be linked to the Bushmaster Adam had? What's with the continuity errors in the crime scene photos, not only at the school, but at Adam's house? What's with all the moving trucks at the abandoned school the day before moving things into the school? The photos from the school look like movers came in and just dropped boxes off randomly. It looks like the school hasn't been used in years, and definitely does not look like an environment kids would be learning in. Not to mention the point I brought up earlier about it being closed in 08 due to asbestos. Why crudely photoshop together class photos and show them on the news? They're seriously bad.Sorry if you don't like my response, but more DOESN'T make sense than DOES make sense, so that's why I believe it was a complete fabrication. I'm totally open to listen to other points of view of course.
<|endoftext|>Sounds like Paul Fox found some back up copies of Lanzas Files and was going to turn over some critical information regarding Lanza, but then someone stepped in and gave him a little 'pep talk' and slap on the wrist. Fox knew he got set up and I am willing to bet he found out by whom and headed for the hills.
<|endoftext|>[Got ya covered]( find it through Google anymore - it was the first hit on DDG for me though. You can download the PDF from there or read through the different chapters. IMO you can skip the prologue and just get to the guts of it.
<|endoftext|>Interesting! Never came across this and its something I need to consider. I know you might not be convinced either way, but if all the things youve read, whats your best guess as to what happened?
<|endoftext|>Its because "The Government" wouldn't do that. What is really hard for people to grasp is that there are more than enough criminals in the world to pull off any kind stunt. There are mafias, gangs, cartels, private militias, hitmen, banking fraudsters, etc. There is no short supply of corruptible goons among us.
<|endoftext|>I don't see any psychiatrist anymore after everything. Never really needed one in the first place I was just a dumbass middle schooler.
<|endoftext|>Yes. There could be thousands upon thousands of people out there who have done all the research and preparation required to have a great mass shooting and all they need is that one pill to set them off. Come on!
<|endoftext|>I consider the growing disbelief in God to be another symptom. The protestant churches have been taken from within while the parishioners slept. They provided the moral foundation for the great achievements of Western society. Throughout human history success has always been the most difficult condition to overcome. Now the enemy is at the door and still many remain asleep.
<|endoftext|>Its absolutely a lot to take in! I was tired when I wrote that, so I was vague, sorry. I had to look up the guys name -- Todd Beamer -- who supposedly overpowered the terrorists on Flight 93 along with a group of people, and he was heard on audio saying "Let's roll". People were saying "Let's roll" in reference to 9/11 back then. I remember seeing his wife interviewed on TV. I was 23 when 9/11 happened so I remember it well. I wasn't into conspiracies back then, but that whole story immediately rang so false to me. So the one plane that happens to be heading for the White House is the one that gets overpowered, by some hero with a catchphrase? No way. I figured it was shot down, but I didn't know what to make of the wife. The conspiracy theorist seeds were probably planting in my head all the way back then, haha.
<|endoftext|>Theres also another conspiracy (not saying I believe it, but I found it to be entertaining) that the children are trafficked which is way you see them in Sandy Hook and later on in the Super Bowl. Given that high ranking officials partake in human trafficking rings, its not *impossible*
<|endoftext|>I think the real conspiracy here is people hate paying for asbestos removal so they just commit a false flag like 9/11 & Sandy Hook/s
<|endoftext|>Got a link to a good examination of these photos and the inconsistencies and stuff? Ive never looked into this beyond a few years ago. Id' like to review it.
<|endoftext|>To answer your point about the Social Security Death Index, it seems like it's just an incomplete record. For the whole state of Connecticut, it only lists 9 deaths after 2010 for people born after 2000 (children), and the total number of deaths 2010 to 2014 is about 45,000 (compared with 146,903 according to the Connecticut government at [this link]( I can't find any deaths later than 2011--although FamilySearch won't let me sort by year, so I'm just scrolling through the pages. If you look at other states, it's similar: SSDI for Massachusetts lists 18 child mortalities since 2010, and about 83,000 total deaths, whereas [Massachusetts government]( lists closer to 265,000 deaths for the same time period. I think the records are updated infrequently and peter out after about 2011. Moreover, they probably don't always report deaths of children, because a) they are not earning income, paying taxes, or applying for jobs (so they might fly under the radar of social security), b) their parents might be unwilling to or uninterested in reporting their deaths, c) there may exist rules against recording the death of a minor, or d) other reasons I haven't thought of. Either way, the phenomenon you mentioned with the Social Security Death Index is not limited to Newtown or even the state of Connecticut.
<|endoftext|>It said teenage patient. That part stands out more to me than the destruction of records. If the guy is a creep he might be easily blackmailed. Not saying its evidence or anything, I just see boogy-men everywhere nowadays.
<|endoftext|>Yes but dude, the prologue is epic. It goes through other false flags including JFK and hammers in how we've been lied too since day 1. It's really good.
<|endoftext|>Oh man, I honestly don't know. I think there are 4 possibilities based on all my current knowledge and gut feeling (which means nothing, in the grand scheme of things). I'll order them below from what I believe to be the least likely explanation, to most likely.1. It was entirely orchestrated, from the ground up. No-one died, the school was empty and everything was fabricated. 2. A shooting happened, people died but the shooter wasn't Lanza. Multiple parts were orchestrated and fabricated by people unknown and Lanza copped the blame. 3. Lanza acted entirely on his own. He was just a messed up kid and this was a tragic event. 4. Lanza was the shooter, many people died, but multiple parts were orchestrated (and *some* parts fabricated) by people unknown. People died, but the event was 'forced' in a way. It was allowed to happen, and even scripted to happen to some extent.  2 and 3 are interchangeable in that list depending on the day and how thick my tin foil hat is at that moment in time. (it varies, depending on my mood and shit) hahaha.
<|endoftext|>I am as surprised, almost every time there is a mass shooting the uS, its some white dudes face appears in the suspect photos.Or is it just my own misguided biased, bigoted, racist, homophobic perspective.
<|endoftext|>I wonder if you've ever taken anti-depressant meds?Depression leaves many people very inactive.  They have no energy. Slow. Tired. Withdrawn. But the very dark thoughts can be constant. Certainly, imagining suicide and homicide during a depression is common, and the mental exercise of planning and execution can be a way to indulge the dark thoughts and push back the immobilizing boredom that also accompanies a severe depression.  Anti-depressants can 'energize' the depression. And can push a person into mania. Which is an overactive state. This is why there are warnings that suicide is a risk! The person, feeling manic, can become very determined in executing all those dark fantasies. Mania can provide almost a superhuman level of thinking and acting. Craziness that seems rational to the manic person. Withdrawal from psych meds can also cause changes in behavior. A return to dark fantasy even worse. Add an adolescent brain to all of the above..... recipe for tragedy.
<|endoftext|>Mania is a very common and known side effect of anti-depressant drugs. Mania can cause the person to act on the dark thoughts experienced while depressed. Mania is almost a 'high' to someone that has been slow, dark and tired in their depression.  Creative, active, complex thinking also accompanies mania. It's the dangerous phase of bi-polar. Depression is the inactive, sleepy, slow phase.
<|endoftext|>I bet if you looked up Chantix within this forum youd find yourself in a rabbit hole for sure, if you do - links to the most crazy shit wud be appreciated haha
<|endoftext|>Yeah it always kind of confused me how they could get such a clear call from up in the air. I've never gotten service in the sky. I've never heard of this guy though, thanks for the lead
<|endoftext|>Yeah but why would they be so careless to use the same kids? Ik the whole hide in plain sight thing but thats just stupid
<|endoftext|>Interesting, Id think thatd be something theyd stay on top of. Other states seem to. Thanks for bringing that up
<|endoftext|>wow - you're not kidding. I checked out a few different sites and it's been pulled. If you want to PM me I can hook you up with a copy.
<|endoftext|>[I uploaded my copy for you]( was a link I used to have that had existed for years, one week I shared it on reddit and within days it was gone from the archive website. I dont want to spoil the existing links so I just create temporary manual uploads from free sites that expire
<|endoftext|>Oh the irony. Youre gonna be real mad at yourself one day when you finally wake up. Thats *if* you wake up.
<|endoftext|>the most thoroughly debunked false flag claim that I am aware ofPlease share the media that debunked it so we can all wake up from our slumber and get on your level of sanity
<|endoftext|>The pill pushes them over the edge which causes them to research which is the best weapon to use in a mass murder, buy the weapon and a shitload of ancillary equipment, train with the gun and other equipment, scout a target, write a manifesto, and only then attack? What world do you live in?
<|endoftext|>One more thing I'll say, because I always bring this up when people mention the calls from the air: in the 90s and early 2000s, many planes had corded phones attached to the back of the headrests. Some don't remember them now, but they were there. You swiped a credit card and paid an exorbitant fee, and you could make a call from the air. Obviously they don't exist anymore. I'm such a conspiracy theorist now, that I wouldn't be surprised if those phones weren't on planes for a few years with the sole purpose of unfolding the future 9/11. Who knows.
<|endoftext|>I always try to call my friends from airplanes to test the theory. I consider the idea that people were making phone calls from flight 93 beyond belief.
<|endoftext|>I don't think it's a state thing, Social Security is a federal organization. They just sort their data by state. They also explicitly say that not every death is registered there. "You will not find everyone who died from about 1962 to March 2014, but it does list many deaths in that time frame."
<|endoftext|>Ahh ok. I think that's still something that one would lose a license for, but I guess not a statutory crime? Not sure.
<|endoftext|>Not one pill, but years of brain chemistry-altering medication, often from adolescence or even childhood.
<|endoftext|>Have you never encountered a person suffering a manic breakdown?  Very scary in what can be accomplished behing that enegry. Mania can certainly be fueled by psych meds.
<|endoftext|>If those calls were placed during cruising altitude i highly doubt they used cell technology. Instead the calls were muliplexed over a satellite link or some other RF link back to a terrestrial antenna that then interfaced with the public switched telephone network. Not sure, im going to look into it. Im almost 40 and i do remember seeing the phones on planes and i think i may have used on but not sure. Glad you brought this up. Interesting
<|endoftext|> everyone reading this appears to be the 3 acts of This American Life that cover Sandy Hook, Alex Jones and Lenny Pozner, the parent from Sandy Hook who produced a birth/death certificate.
<|endoftext|>You are sounds like a big Pharma defender. Some get paid. Don't waste your time. You should see them come out of the woodwork in the vaccine wars.
<|endoftext|>Temporary mania does not research, plan, purchase, and execute anything. That's why they treat it as a mental illness.
<|endoftext|>Airfone for $4/min! As far as cell phones back then, Dual and Tri-Mode phones could fall back on AMPS analog cellular service, which had longer range than CDMA or GSM. At least Verizon (for Onstar and many alarm systems) and T-Mobile kept analog service until 2008, despite bragging about being all digital.
<|endoftext|>You're not getting it and arguing against your image of what you think the poster is trying to do (downplay radicalization) whereas you're not willing to see that certain side effects of psychotropic drugs *can* (NOT *will*) lead to perceptions that allow these people to unhinge themselves.
<|endoftext|>Why do you keep insisting that a person suddenly makes plans about mass murder and it all happens all at once?  The fantasizing, planning and preparing could have been going on for a long time.... in the name of hobby, politics, boredom, ego, macho, whatever, the psych meds trigger mania that is like pouring gasoline on a fire.
<|endoftext|>I am not buying into the programming, which is what you are spouting. I have addressed what effect the drugs could logically have, yet none of the points I have made have been addressed at all. The drugs do not cause people to plan and perform tasks requiring a high degree of motivation and cognitive skill. That is simply absurd to postulate.
<|endoftext|>It is difficult to condition people to kill other people. The military has a hard time with this, and generally their soldiers kill people who are trying to kill them. A substantial proportion of soldiers won't fire at someone even when their own life is in danger. You are treating this notion that crazy people are these manic superhumans as axiomatic because you have been conditioned to believe that. There are no studies that show this to be true. There is no evidence that people commit mass murder because they go crazy. Not one day, not 100 days. Typically they kill for a cause that they have been heavily indoctrinated into. That level of indoctrination is typically what is called mind control.
<|endoftext|>You're being bullheaded.I have addressed what effect the drugs could logically have, yet none of the points I have made have been addressed at all.you did nothing of the sortThe drugs do not cause people to plan and perform tasks requiring a high degree of motivation and cognitive skill.No one is saying that. People are theorizing how "random" those same people you talk about are when psychotropic drugs are prescribed willy nilly in combination with the echo chambers of the darker, more hateful corners of the internet for example or even just if it's a steady diet of Fox News, which there was an article about not too long ago, how often they used the term invasion in reference to migrants. As a teenager I was supposed to take an anti depressant because I had some issues stemming from fucked up relations. I didn't like it but I just wanted people to leave me be so I said fuck it, let's try it. Now, I'm not saying drugs don't work, not at all. Just that my experience was a strong feeling of depersonalization, from which it would not be hard to extrapolate that if something gave me purpose in that time I might've attached myself to it, but I'm stubborn like you and would've rather been "depressed" (=be a fucking teenager that had no perspective or self agency) than feeling like I'm losing awareness of myself.
<|endoftext|>It's difficult to condition NORMAL people to kill other people. The military tries their best to keep young people with a history of psych meds and adolescent mental health issues out. Yeah, who exactly indoctrinated the Columbine killers, both who were prescribed psych meds.Who exactly indoctrinated Adam Lansa? Also a history of psych meds.Who exactly indoctrinated the El Paso shooter? You've been told Trump, but his drug addict psychologist Daddy had fuck-all to do with it?There is plenty of evidence that a very common denominator in the mass shooters is a history of mental illness and PSYCH MEDS.  Only since the HIPPA laws, we don't get to know about their medical history much anymore. Wonder why?
<|endoftext|>That depersonalization, as you call it, provides you with the insulation you need from your feelings to allow your mind to reintegrate. It is a drug induced version of what your brain should, and probably would have done naturally given the right conditions and enough time. It does not cause you to be motivated to do much of anything. In fact, most people on those drugs spend a lot of time sitting and staring. They certainly don't plan anything as complex as we have seen in many of the recent mass murders.
<|endoftext|>It is difficult to condition anyone to kill someone. It is one of the great liberal lies that if you give someone a gun they will automatically kill someone with it. Generally even if a mentally ill person does commit murder it is because they are extremely dysfunctional, and that is quite rare. Mental illness can, however, provide an opportunity for those organizations that use mind control. Apparently those with dissociative identity disorder are right at the top of the list when it comes to hypnosis. Those with PTSD are right up there too. The conditioning seems to be very traumatic. I believe the use of psych meds is due to the fact that those who are being conditioned feel like they are going crazy and naturally they seek psychiatric help. I have no idea if the meds make them more or less susceptible to the mind control -- my feeling is that it might make them less susceptible. I've been studying Eddie Routh, the person convicted of killing Chris Kyle, the famous Navy SEAL sniper. Routh, from all accounts seemed to get better from the psych meds. The marijuana seemed to hurt him more than anything.I found an interesting [potential tie]( between Routh and the El Paso shooter's dad. He's a New Age nut for sure. I think his dad was primarily responsible for the son's indoctrination. He must have been very confident of the control he had over the son. Usually they implant a self destruct command as part of the programming.
<|endoftext|>Manic people certainly don't sit and stare. Psych meds can induce mania. Common side-effect. Look it up.
<|endoftext|>In fact, most people on those drugs spend a lot of time sitting and staring.They are not braindead though, they still receive and process information and if say a sudden change in medication makes the emotions held at bay come rushing in and they were at a place of arguing about things like invasions and infestations, the sudden increase in strong feelings might make them feel justified in taking action and this or similar hypotheticals is what people want to explore. The recent tragedies aren't sophisticated, it's what the rest of the world is trying to tell the us, the abundance of highly efficient tools for killing will lead to misuse.
<|endoftext|>Yes, they are not "brain dead" and if they stop taking the drugs they are flooded with emotions that have been held at bay by the drugs. That flood of emotions can cause homicidal or more often suicidal thoughts. Those are a short term reaction and they do not form complex behaviors or motives. They often cause spur of the moment actions but have never been shown to drive cognitively complex plans of action.The recent shootings have shown characteristics of complex planning. The shooters are typically not people who use guns as part of their normal recreational activities.  Usually the fascination with guns is induced suddenly and obsessively. This is not a known reaction to any drug. They research and purchase the weapons legally. They research and purchase ancillary equipment such as high capacity magazines, body armor, and other equipment to make their shooting time more productive. Again, not a known side effect of any drug. They often reconnoiter their target and develop a plan of attack. None of these things is a known side effect of any drug, and they are actions so far from any known side effect that it is ridiculous to assume they would be that.
<|endoftext|>Seems you were right about the MJ:Obtained anonymous self-reported drug usage data and Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility scores from 282 college students. Frequent marihuana users (more than 10 times) showed greater susceptibility to hypnosis than nonusers. There were no differences in primary suggestibility between principled nonusers and nonusers or between single-time, occasional, and frequent users. Frequent smoking of marihuana was significantly associated with S's sex, academic major, religion, family income, previous trancelike experience, and the usage of other major drugs. Frequency of drug usage data were compared with other major surveys. Findings are discussed in terms of sensation seeking and previously reported personality characteristics of marihuana users. -- 
<|endoftext|>... or they are self inserting into the fantasies that others have thought, written out and shared with each other by passive, uncritical absorption. AND AGAIN AND IN FUCKING CAPS LOCK BECAUSE AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE YOU TO BE DELIBERATELY OBTUSE, NO ONE IS SAYING THE DRUGS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE**I only now thought of mentioning that you and the thread are talking about slightly similar but not the same things in regards to radicalization and stochastic terrorism(pls correct me with a more fitting term if there is one) induced by perception altering drugs. Would've probably been better than going full caps, sorry

<|endoftext|>Ok here me out... it just takes a moment,So, I remember watching a very interesting documentary on how we dispose of our nuclear waste and how we can warn future generations (so far down in time, that they may not even speak our language or any for that matter) not to dig or live or grow food in that area. The reasoning behind this is that the half-life on the waste takes so long to dissipate that the unknowing travelers/settlers would settle upon a tainted landscape that may not be visibly apparent.The documentary ([ goes on to show how we might visualize a message to those future generations by building horrific sculptures (of nasty angles and serrated/sharp pylons) or giant plaques or points of interest that did it's best to convey, "Hey, get the fuck out of here."Okay, with me so far? He's not the only one performing Archaeoastronomy to ancient megalithic sites, but Graham Hancock has does a great job correlating other's work. In his documentary ([ he shows ancient sites around the world aligned to stars as they were in 10,500 BC (nearly 12,500 years ago). The Pyramid was aligned to the belt of Orion (and the Sphinx aligned to stars as well during this date), Angkor Wat was aligned to Draco, I believe it was Teotihuacan was aligned to the Pleiades and so on.What if these ancient sites were their way of saying "Hey, look to the stars because shit hits the fan every once and a while, and it's the best gauge to tell you when it's coming?" What if they were doing what we are doing with our nuclear waste fields? Trying to give a message down the ages that is universal (literally and figuratively), a warning that informs us no matter what language we speak during our time?Ancient aligned sites are warnings to future generations of impeding cycles of cataclysm.The Golden/Great Year/Cycle ([ is known by many throughout time, said to consist of 25,920 years (72 years per degree of a circle/zodiac, x 360 = 25,920).  The cycle is punctuated by catastrophe at it's midway point and at the culmination.Just one of my big conclusions as of late.
<|endoftext|>The first thing that comes to mind is Plato's [Timaeus]( and the Egyptian priest's assertions that periodic conflagrations and other cyclical disasters keep causing the collapse of civilisation.

Regardless of the answer, you end up in a deep deep rabbit hole and further answers might render our knowledge of... pretty much everything scarily meaningless. Theres this joke where a guy who led an exemplary life, full of compassion and sacrifice, deeply religious. He dies, ends up in heaven and asks an archangel: what was the purpose of my life? And the archangel goes: - do you remember one time you were on the train between Geneva and Lausanne? And the man, eager to to hear the answer: yes! Of course I remember! Do you remember you went to the restaurant and a guy at the next table asked you to pass him some salt? - why, yes I remember!!. - Well, that was it.
<|endoftext|> Thomas Adam and Eve Story strongly recommended for this topic
<|endoftext|>It's called the electric universe theory and it explains much of the catastrophic nture of our planet. Sorry if it's been covered already but it should be stated in a thread like this. The youtube channel "thunderbolts project" covers current and historical data, happenings, suppression, ignorance and evidence surrounding a plasma-based universal theory that dispenses with the fairy dust of "dark matter and dark energy" and explains things from an electrical standpoint. And it is spot-on. An offshoot and peripheral group is called suspicious observers. Lead by a meteorological lawyer this group is working on climate change, severe weather associated with our star, catastrophism, space weather, published scientific papers and their idiotic attempt to support the mainstream astrophysics theories, climate forcing, the Suns role in the catastrophic 12,500 year cycle and education for surviving the coming catastrophe. Solid science, no bullshit, no tinfoil hat crap. Sorry I never posted here before hopefully this hasn't been covered before
<|endoftext|>The weakening magnetosphere is certainly interesting. Ive always wondered if, during this period of flux (with respect to our shield, as it were), that the added cosmic rays and radiation and whatnot might act as a means to spurring evolution, re: DNA all over the world having little mistakes knocked into it from being struck by rays that would otherwise be deflected by the magnetosphere.Maybe this flip has more to do with our evolution than we are taught, or that it is known. Or, perhaps it is know / speculated upon, and I just havent been paying much attention.On that note, yes, the sun is entering a solar minimum, and yes, it is also entering a grand minimum.Though, it is discussed. Because, knowledge that the sun is powering down to a lower state (minimum + grand minimum) is part of the current climate change models.Accounting for extra heat in Earths lower atmosphere, and not her upper atmosphere, *during* a solar grand minimum is a good chuck of the proof(s) that the current forcing we are experiencing on the climate system is from man, and our ongoing release of industrial-scale greenhouse gasses.Yay, 2019, data, scientists, scientific instruments galore!What a time to be alive, and to openly wonder, and to make curious conjecture of things.
<|endoftext|>Can anybody find something that links our planet's natural disasters with the state of the human collective consciousness? I remember reading it somewhere but cannot find it anymore where it says that if the collective consciousness is good, loving and selfless, then the climate of the planet they inhabit reflects that.

<|endoftext|>I'm glad this is a discussion! I recently discovered these concepts of magnetic reversal and solar minimum and I've been researching what I could. What I have found is there is scant information, it commonly seems haphazard or "crazy," and yet the guys committed to it really believe it and have good data to back it up. I've found youtube to be the most persistent community of these thinkers, whether it's Diamond at the Oppenheimer Ranch Report or Ice Age Farmer. Their idea is that - the solar wind has far more say over Earth's climate than the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. When the sun weakens, so too does the Earth's magnetic field and cosmic radiation is more able to effect lower levels of the atmosphere, particularly in regards to cloud formation, which increases with cosmic radiation. It is easy to confirm that the sun's output varies in 11 year cycles, but what is often not mentioned is that these up/down cycles vary in intensity on larger time frames, from highs to lows, and we are currently projected to be heading into a downward slope of solar output, which should increase cloud coverage/decrease temperature and lead to more snow falling than melting.I have NO idea if these ideas are true and I am really doing what I can do look into it all. Is the info being suppressed? If so, then why? I have to ask myself why the climate catastrophe narrative has gotten so loud despite nothing actually being done about it, while actual pollution of chemicals, poisons, and run-off slides under the radar? And these lines of thinking are exactly how you end up at this subreddit.
<|endoftext|>Just going to leave this recent journal from a very highly respected place.  Role of Geomagnetic Field Intensity in Late Quaternary Evolution of Humans and Large Mammals
<|endoftext|>what is interesting is a correlation between solar activity and volcanic. [ Another potential way in which solar minimum affects our terrestrial climate is through volcanic eruption. This [paper]( shows a strong association between eruption timing and the solar minimum, statistically significant to a confidence level of 96.7%. "No obvious mechanism yet, but if the relationship is affected by the solar wind it may be affected by our transition around the spiral arms of the galaxy and variations in cosmic rays from other events in the core or more locally such as supernova.Some extinction events are attributed to asteroid or comet impacts, however sufficiently large and violent volcanic erruptions can also release iridium and the traces of an impact strike could be misattributed.There appears to be evidence in support of both hypotheses in the Yucatan.In terms of Earth cycles, the big cycles appear to be initiated by Milankovitch cycles, but also the cosmic ray flux.An additional variable is volcanic and impact.Solar winds deposit a lot of energy around the ionosphere of Earth. Its enormous how much energy is there I recall it being estimated in the many thousands of GW.It can also affect wind patterns and press on the atmosphere propper.The sun bombards the Earth with neutrinos, these are hardly absorbed but from what I can gain from a literature search a large fraction change from one type of neutrino to another as they transit through Earth. Perhaps this effects nuclear reactions and isotope decay and thereby volcanic activity.I came up with that idea years ago so I was pleased to find this on a more recent search - [ that's then needed is to tie the rate of solar neutrinos to solar weather such as the solar wind -[ the controversy regarding low energy nuclear reactions and the debate around therate of isotope decay varying apparently in relation to Earths position in relation to the sun, this is disputed but interesting as it suggests that there is an external influence on radioactive decay.Cold fusion being increasingly seen as credible, could this be involved? Experiments have looked at fusion by-products like tritium at volcanically active sites, some hinted at evidence of fusion occuring but again, disputed, or has an innocent explanation."Thus, both tritium and 3He/4He ratios are low for subducting zone volcanoes, yet anomalously high for the hot spot volcano Kilauea and, evidently, Alcedo geyser. We suggest the following hypothesis, building on our earlier geo-fusion hypothesis "[ very (0.5km) deep ruins off the coast of Cuba also hint at sudden fall in altitude of parts of the crust, or immense antiquity.I also find it difficult to believe that latitudes as far north as Britain were tropical. which makes me wonder if the Earths pole actually moves quite considerably. A big change in the orientation of the inner part of the planet would create an opposite motion in the mantle and a change in the pole as well as the magnetic pole assuming that derives from the core flipping.
<|endoftext|>I think a lot of the catastrophe cycles have to do with the Yugas (seasons) of the Great Year -- the 25,920 year cycle of the Sun spiraling with its binary partner along its orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. Imagine the winter-spring-summer-autumn cycle but on a much grander scale. (Best I can tell, we're leaving "winter" and entering "spring".)Couple this with the idea that the Earth is growing. Growing in mass, drawn from the ether, and in volume. Turns out the Earth and most planets are very young, growing stars. So we're surface dwellers on the surface of a growing star. There are going to be disruptions, as it grows, that are hostile to life -- for example, the Great Flood as water first broke to the surface, en mass.If this concept is interesting to you, you may enjoy this playlist that walks through it in more detail:[The Growing Earth, Yuga Cycle, Sirius B Connection](
<|endoftext|>This is potentially of interest, especially in the solar influence of the Earth being far more involved than thought, sense of it.So, the Sun minima and maxima phases has apparently the ability to influence Earth's winds as well as ocean circulation, sea levels and climate.[ went looking for this graph and dug up some interesting things. Prof Nils-Axel Mrner claims that the solar activity is related to the rotation rate of the planet, see here [ thought this sounded preposterous but I was able to find other scientists link solar winds with Earth rotation rates see here [ demonstrate a connection between solar activity and changes in Earth day length on a 22 year cycle. They conclude that the solar wind is able to mediate a transfer of angular momentum from the sun to Earth. Solar winds appear to mediate a 22 year cycle in Earth's rotation rate and in Earths geomagnetism.Also of interest is that Prof Nils-Axel Mrner talks about in this link [ that the sun rotates around a centre of mass for the Solar System and due to this the Sun moves around the centre by a distance of more than the Sun itself, and that the planets are estimated to exert substantial effects on the suns internal structures, and its subsequent activity. Therefore, there could be effects of our weather due to conjunctions of planetary orbits, perhaps implying some basis to astrology.
<|endoftext|>Regardless of Human activity - the precise effect of which is not predictable in either direction or degree IN PRINCIPLE - (once you understand non linear systems and sensitive dependence on initial conditions - and that puts the lie to ''climate science'' immediately) - huge changes in climate are normal and disasters are ALWAYS potentially imminent. There are doubtless planetary, solar and cosmic factors unknown at this time and some of which may be unknowable. The whole thing is a scam from top to bottom. It relies on gigantic ignorance - which there always is.

Literally all life on earth is carbon-based. More carbon is emitted by a single volcanic eruption than all the cars on the earth emit in a year. Oil and natural gas are a byproduct of the earths natural processes. They are a renewable resource. The oceans algae and phytoplankton sequester carbon, and other life forms fall to the ocean floor and through the process of tidal forces, oceanic pressure and thermal vents, find their way to reservoirs. Its slower than the water cycle obviously but it will eventually return to balance. The earth is fine. Check out Thomas Gold , hes brilliant.

<|endoftext|>Magnetic Pole Shifts and Climate change?[ Links between changes in the Earth's magnetic field and climate change, have been proposed previously although the exact mechanism is disputed. These include: The Earth's magnetic field affects the energy transfer rates from the solar wind to the Earth's atmosphere which in turn affects the North Atlantic Oscillation. Movement of the poles changes the geographic distribution of galactic and solar cosmic rays, moving them to particularly climate sensitive areas. Changes in distribution of ultraviolet rays resulting from the movement of the magnetic field, may result in increases in the death rates of carbon sinking oceanic plant life such as phytoplankton. [ first serious proposals, that quantify this possible link, were given by Wollin et al. \[[1]( who pointed out that low geomagnetic intensities are generally associated with warm climate periods (similar to the current situation), and by Bucha \[[10]( who suggested that drifts of geomagnetic poles could have been responsible for displacements of a large low-pressure region of the Earths atmosphere associated with an increase of cyclonic activity and sudden climate changes \[[11]( the last few decades, other mechanisms that could explain the geomagnetic field-climate relation have been proposed (e.g. \[[3]( [4]( [6]( [8]( The most plausible at long-time scale is related to the rate of galactic cosmic rays coming to the Earths surface. This flux of galactic cosmic rays is modulated by the intensity of both Sun and the Earths magnetic fields that act as a protective shield."\-This means that there are THREE overlapping variables that can interact to different degrees just for the influence of cosmic rays on cloud cover. 1 - The Solar Wind - 2 Total Solar + Galactic Flux and 3 - Earths changing magnetic field.

The frequency at which the Earth's ionosphere resonates at (~7.5Hz) which is roughly the same frequency as brainwaves in the theta spectrum (~6-8Hz), aka brainwaves emitted when in a meditative state.

It's also been suggested that it's through this medium by which psychic/telepathic communication can be made possible, or at least easier, as it utilises the mechanic of sympathetic resonance - a phenomena well known in physics by which two oscillators which are vibrating at a similar enough frequency will naturally synchronise with one another.

<|endoftext|>I don't think the plates are physically moving, the shifting of the poles re-orients Earth to where Britain has a tropical climate.The grand solar minimum coinciding with volcanic eruption is interesting. I dont know much about neutrinos or ions but I know the basics about thermodynamics. It makes sense if magma is hot and the sun products heat, then Earth's crust acts as a sort of buffer. If the sun stops producing as much heat (or neutrinos or other plasma energy etc.) Then there would be a reaction to maintain equilibrium.Lastly, the pole shifts every 26,000 years or so. This coincides with the Golden Cycle mentioned as well as many of these cataclysms.

<|endoftext|>Huh, interesting. Lots of Astrotheology thrown into religious texts. As we just had our Winter Solstice, one can see the similarities in Jesus.

<|endoftext|>It takes 25,772 for the sun to go through a complete cycle and align with the center of the milky way galaxy, this is broken up into "ages" which uses the zodiac callander which takes 2150 years to pass through one age to another. We have monuments that are designed to line up on the summer and winter solstices, we have some that are inline with certain constellations...Imagine if there was something that entered into earth's orbit every few thousand years and caused a max extinction, ancient cultures knew of this and wanted to warn us so we could begin preparing ourselves and the way they warned us was by creating something that on a very specific time in the future would align with the sun and stars. Hopefully by passing down stories (Noah, Gilgamesh etc) we were aware it was coming and these monuments would act like big count down clocks so we knew when to expect it....I dunno.... something like this I think.
<|endoftext|>They also had eight sides. They were discovered by a pilot flying over the Great Pyramids on the Equinox or Solstice (can't remember) - during this time of year you can see the shadows play on the eight sides: [ Great Pyramids (not all pyramids) were clocks and gave orientation to those in aviation. From above, looking at the Pyramids you can tell what time of day it is, your cardinal direction (N, S, E, West etc) and much more. We didn't notice the eight sides of the pyramid until aviation. The Great Pyramids are also aligned to the stars in several ways; the three major pyramids are aligned to Orion's Belt. The Sphinx (half lion/half woman) points towards the constellations Virgo and Leo I believe. The air ducts or "star shafts" ( [ ) of the Pyramids are also believed to be aligned to Orion and other Star Systems (thus the name of the shafts). They say it was to ventilate the "mummy" chambers, but as we know, no mummies (or hieroglyphics aside from one bit of vandalism by Vyse) were ever discovered in the Great Pyramids (save 1, in a wooden coffin from millennia later, nowhere near any "burial chambers").

<|endoftext|>The magnetosphere is hypothesized to be generated by large iron deposit flows coming out of the core and flowing through, or to? the mantle.

Difficult to know the repercussions. Crustal movement certainly possible

<|endoftext|>re: human activity vs climate cycles article headline:Cultural evolution caused broad-scale historical declines of large mammals across China (dec 27 2019)summery:Extirpations of 5 megafauna taxa from much of China over the past 2 millennia were found to be closely linked to filtering effects driven by cultural evolution rather than climate change from article:Human activities are now playing a dominant role in driving changes in Earth's biodiversity and are responsible for the incipient sixth mass extinction, but the historical processes leading to this situation are poorly understood, often without emphasis on cultural evolution as a potential key process underlying anthropogenic impacts. A team of researchers from Aarhus University and Nanjing University has now shown that cultural evolution overshadowed climate change in driving historical broad-scale biodiversity dynamics.By mining the deep Chinese administrative records in relation to culturally important wild megafauna species as well as sociocultural development, the researchers identified the millennia-long spread of agricultural land and agricultural intensification, as well as the specific expansion of the Han culture, as the main cause of the extirpation of five megafauna species from much of China, with little or no direct importance of climate.Cultural evolution, not climate change, as the main driver"China's well-preserved written records for more than 2000 years provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct long-term dynamics of culture-nature interactions across large geographical extents,"

Hes not a Trump supporter but he has had meetings with the Alliance behind Trump and believes their overall agenda is a good one.

<|endoftext|>An electromagnetic field can only be generated with planets that have an active core (typically gravity is also included), but I could have worded that better. Its technically generated by the process of convection in earths core which is a process of GPE (gravitational potential energy) overcoming degeneracy pressure.
<|endoftext|>Thus, to strip it away would require the internal processes of the earth to stop working as they once did.
<|endoftext|>Oh, it is far too late for that. After reading, watching and listening to a ton of related materials, my horror and anxiety on the topic are peaking.
<|endoftext|>Thank you for putting it into words. I've been thinking about this in a similar way but could not explain it to others.
<|endoftext|>Nobody calls it 'Simulation Theory'.It's called the 'Simulation Argument'. It's a logical argument....There are 3 arguments.... Which one of the premises to the argument do you think is flawed?
<|endoftext|>I too believe Earth is growing, but that would imply lesser gravity in ancient times. And just from a mechanical engineering standpoint, that would imply that ancient flora and fauna could and would grow proportionately larger, given similar bone and fiber density and strength. Meganaura, for example, were pretty much giant dragonflies -- something like 5x the size of modern ones. A brontosaurus would collapse under its own weight in modern gravity. Compare the leg structure of a tyrannosaurus rex to a similarly sized modern elephant. (And no, denser oxygen does not account for the structural/engineering aspect of the scaling.) And there are many reports and pictures of huge humanoid skeletons, many times larger than modern man. So I believe the Earth was smaller, but the surface dwelling organism were larger. Further, I believe the Earth, moon, and planets are simply very young stars. They're the same thing as our Sun, just very early on in the growth process. (And vice versa -- the Sun used to be a planet and Earth, Jupiter, etc. were its moons.)So here's the punch line: We are surface-dwellers on the hard, crusty surface of a very young, growing star. The crust is, essentially, an organic Dyson sphere -- which means we are a Type 2 civilization on the Kardashev scale, although most of that energy is controlled and distributed by the oligarch class.So when people talk about exploring the stars, it's a bit of a joke -- we're on one already! I have no idea how long the surface will be habitable, but I suspect this dynamic is what the Big Game is all about: Humanity will be sacrificed by fire in order to get a select group of families off the planet... er, star... before it's too late.
<|endoftext|>Id think that since we cant figure out how they made some of the things, if theyre aligned with constellations then thats where they came from and they left a mark kinda saying we made this badass shit, stopped by then bounced after taking the women, theres where we came from if you want these bitches back.

<|endoftext|>The President typically doesn't have access to anything classified above the nuclear launch codes. There are some rumors that since the early 2000's President's have been briefed or given a soft-ball version of the UFO phenomenon. However, that requires one to take everything at face value.
<|endoftext|>So far, I've seen no evidence of the Earth's magnetic field "instantly reversing". It appears that the process takes thousands, or even tens of thousands of years. As we are seeing today, as the reversal nears, it looks like the poles start moving faster. In other words, the field begins to move faster near the end.Certainly, as you point out, significant changes in the movement of the liquid parts of the Earth's interior could potentially lead to crustal movement. The earlier poster seemed to be wondering whether the change in the magnetic field might cause crustal movement, which is what I responded to. Both crustal movement and magnetic field changes are potential results of changes in liquid flow, so magnetic field changes don't cause crustal movement.
<|endoftext|>What are you trying to say with this? This study wasn't designed to affirm or refute climate change. Its argument is that large mammals were killed off moreso by human intervention than a shift in climate. That's neither here nor there in the context of this thread.
<|endoftext|>What if this free energy is just being pulled from a giant electromagnetic deep underground that we are living on
<|endoftext|>If you dive deep enough down the rabbit hole, youll realize that this catastrophic cycle is most likely going to happen within our lifetime. Talk about anxiety and stress especially when 98% of people have no clue and look at you like youre an alien when you try to tell them.
<|endoftext|>Lots of people call it theory. Anyway my issue is with the word simulation I described what I thought pretty accurately in my original comment. But to be more precise the word simulation often is interpreted as "not real" and if reality is indeed created I imagine the reality that created this one has some different rules. Its just a little oversimplified I think but it is a good way to begin thinking about the nature of reality.

<|endoftext|>The earlier argument on geology is assuming that all external influences are accounted for in the model; they are not. The sun's influence is more than just radiant energy supplied to the upper atmosphere. From the way I understood it there were several not accounted for by the IPCC Reports. Not to mention the bias algorithms used in temperature modeling, they were caught gaming the numbers. I used to set my watch by accuweather forecasts. That all went to shit about the same time their ability to predict went with the gamed model. Funny how the European model is usually better than ours. Hmm. Maybe someone screwed with ours. Back to the sun, the IPCC is just now allowing one addtl factor into the NEXT report and from what I understand there are still three or four more not used but relevant. I love scientist who work from settled views or consensus logic. It's so riot. Sure we know it all.
<|endoftext|>re:the researchers identified the millennia-long spread of agricultural land and agricultural intensification, as well as the specific expansion of the Han culture, as the main cause of the extirpation of five megafauna species from much of China, with little or no direct importance of climate. Cultural evolution, not climate change, as the main driveI appreciate your effort to focus this topic discussion here to some sensible specifics, we need this.  I am honestly curious how you see this study fitting in.  Seems if you dont see how it does then maybe youre open to widening your perspective? You are a geologist?Take the OPs own description of the topic here... seems a clear desire to generate intelligent discussion on the ULTIMATE conspiracy of the climate change debate [ops caps, not mine]. I take this as invitation into the wider convo. I believe the user you responded to was also discussing the wider topic of interestre: Regardless of Human activity - the precise effect of which is not predictable in either direction or degree IN PRINCIPLE Question for you is ...are you only interested in discussing about a) chemtrails vs grand solar minimums (which is very narrow topic)? ...or are you able to have a discussion about b) human-made vs natural cycles (which is a much wider conversation)?I have given you some food for thought regarding this wider conversation. Take it or leave it, you are totally welcome to ignore this article and continue talking about chemtrails and solar minimums or whatever you like. The article address some very specific things about the wider conversation: that IN SPITE of certain well known natural cataclysmic cycles, there IS evidenced showing humans ARE historically the cause of mass destruction of the megafauna.I would suggest this is certainly relevant to the larger convo regarding the so-called ULTIMATE conspiracy about whether or not various examples well known natural cycles can provide enough evidence on their own to account for the issue of why climate change/science is a threat to life on planet earth. What this article has shown is in this case: it does not.What this means is... irregardless of any documented solar impact on climate change, the human factor IS shown to be a significant to the extirpation of animal life.
<|endoftext|>The Hopi Indians and a lot of religious legend from North and South America states we are in the 4th
<|endoftext|>Climate change is studied by geologists, and is almost unanimously agreed upon. The factors that you're referring to are already accounted for in the study of global warming.
<|endoftext|>The study provided is attempting to prove that human cultural evolution was primarily responsible for the changing distribution of a certain 5 megafauna taxa before the Industrial Era. It's not trying to prove or disprove manmade climate change, it's trying to say that humans had a bigger effect on species than natural changes in climate over the past 2000 years. So hopefully we're on the same page about that.
<|endoftext|>Yea, it was from a pretty good lecture, I can't remember which one. I'm not fully convinced on all of those but he's fascinating to listen to.
<|endoftext|>Hmm.I am confused by the terms you are using. Do you mean our universe is in its fourth iteration and will take 100-700 years to transition to the next?Because for me.... This is how I understand the fourth dimension  On mobile... Plus tired. Need sleep
<|endoftext|>I don't know if you believe what you are saying ie that geologists have a perfect understanding of sensitive dependence on initial conditions non-linear systems and unknown or unknowable cosmic solar resonance etc etc factors. anybody who is read about chaos theory knows that it is impossible to predict what the climate that will do since the inputs are not known with absolute accuracy.
<|endoftext|>Yeah. We need to be ok with understanding that 4th dimension, 5th, 6th cannot be represented visually without going quantum small because we see in the 3rd plane. The 4th dimension is a concept that we are all in. Where is your mind and thoughts, how do you think about concepts, communication etc... but no one else can see it so it doesnt technically exist. But we havent been this aware for so long, maybe the past 100 years in modern history, because its the end of the last cycle and start of next. Earth is changing in ways we cant really comprehend because we dont have enough access to the fourth dimension.Its kinda like the matrix and simulation theory but with quantum physics .Im also on acid typing this so I mean dont go too far in to it
<|endoftext|>That's true for smaller scale predictions, like a 10-day forecast. When you're predicting long-term patterns, infinitesimal chaotic disruptions are less significant. Large-scale climate predictions don't suffer as much from stochastic elements like weather forecasts do
<|endoftext|>Amazing. 5 seconds and I can be given the truth about anything. No need to think for myself, I'll just accept Google as fact!
<|endoftext|>So you are saying geologist know when this interglacial period is going to end and the ice age will resume?
<|endoftext|>I can accept there have been various catastrophes that have knocked humanity back to the Stone Age, I can also believe there might be a country known as Tartaria the was wiped off history. What I struggle with is the 400 year timeline that these cycles supposedly happen in.
<|endoftext|>Woot, mine got picked! Lets dive down the rabbit hole, shall we? Below you will find some comments of mine regarding various posts here, along with resources. This is not extensive and mainly intended as a primer into the topics. _______#Tartaria*   of old maps show that an Empire labeled Tartary existed in the East spanning from Russia all the way to China, and even included some parts of North America! A truly global Empire, and one which dwarfed all Empires of antiquity. We know that for a fact because of the historical evidence finally coming to light. The premise behind this theory is that this Empire was an advanced people with advance technology (Think Tesla technology), and were wiped out or culled to very, very low numbers world wide. Their technology hidden and buildings repurposed. Why did this happen, and who did it? No one really knows (theories abound, though!), same with Atlantis and Hyperborea.  ______#Cultural Layer*  premise for Cultural Layer is that something catastrophic in very recent history (late 1700s-1800s) happened which buried buildings from a recently lost advanced civilization (which many suspect Tartaria). Many old buildings seem to have been built oddly (albeit majestically - advanced technology involved), but when you excavate them, it shows how the *original* buildings look which makes far more sense (ie. Half buried windows, doors, etc etc).* [For example, here is an extensive list of photographic evidence of this world wide phenomenon.](  flood is one theory on **how** there is this "cultural layer" in nearly every city all over the world. What caused this mud flood is up for debate, and not many researchers into this topic really can agree. The theories range from an electric universe event to a 18-19th century nuclear winter of some sorts. What we do know for certain is that there is a natural phenomenon called liquefaction. However, we also know that this phenomenon can be triggered by man using frequency machines (Think Tesla technology).______#Foundlings & Orphan Trains*  in the world happened in the late/early 1800's, where hundreds of thousands of children were abandoned all over the world (often times forced by the state, if the mother was unmarried), and then shipped to all parts of the world? These children were called "Foundlings", and it was a world wide phenomenon. Once in the asylums, and hospitals... The children where then given made up names, and sent out from cities to rural areas. They either found foster parents, worked as farm hands, or grew up on their own. With a completely new identity, and no knowledge of their true heritage.________#Global Reset & How TPTB Could Get Away With ItHide all the records in the Vatican vaults, fabricate new "history", eliminate a huge percentage of adults (famine, war, or insane asylums), force women to hand over their children to the state and ship them all over the world (Foundlings), send them on orphan trains for forced labor and/or indoctrinate them in the public schooling. Within two generations, **a complete re-write of history could be achieved!**_______#ResourcesYoutube channels:* [newearth]( [CONSPIRACY-R-US]( [Martin Liedtke]( [Philipp Druzhinin]( [Life Kreationz]( /r/CulturalLayer* /r/Tartaria* /r/AlternativeHistoryWebsite:*  Fixed a link and formatting.
<|endoftext|>Phantom Time - is this when historical events happened at different times than when History says they happened?I cant remember where I read it but it said the dark ages didnt happen and 200 to 300 years has been added to our calendar.

<|endoftext|>Trying to recall the name of the American radio hobbyist that picked up transmissions near Area 51 and was driven insane under coercion by federal authorities.To clarify, he wasn't a UFO guy and thought that what he was picking up were Russian communications during the Cold War. He was foolish enough to alert the FBI, who kept regular tabs on him and basically turned him into a schizophrenic.
<|endoftext|>I can explain the timeline I think. Please forgive me for being blunt, I keep trying to write this but I end up trying to explain every detail and it gets way too long. I am not making any of this up, these are legit ancient teachings found in the dead sea scrolls, nag hammadi gnostic texts, biblical texts, and stories I have read. I will say if something is an opinion of mine. I know this sounds crazy but the spiritual history is key in understanding the timeline and factions so please just hear it out, even if it sounds unbelievable just remember entire religions are based on this, people believe it, and has affected all of history.This is hard, let's start at the fall of the angels. The god of creation in genesis is the devil and is not the Father Jesus teaches of. We are created in the image of the perfect father and this realm is only modeled after the incorruptible realm.Hmmm still so hard to explain.....maybe a list might work. From the beginning.....1. The Father of all that has no beginning or end, everything exists as part of it.2. The forethought of the father, the holy spirit/mother of all.3. The combination of the father and mothers light, the Son.4. The Father, Mother and Son are the trinity.5. 24 holy spirits of creation including Sophia/Wisdom.6. Sophia has an abomination of a son, the first ruler/creator god in genesis, we shall refer to him as Baal.7. Baal creates heaven and earth8. The Archons/Seraphim are his highest angels including Sabbaoth.9. Many angels and demons under them.10. Baal creates man in the fathers image.11. Baal is tricked by angels Sophia sent into passing his holy power to man to give him spirit.12. Baal dumbs down mankind to try to reclaim the holy power he lost.13. Man eats the fruit of knowledge and sobers up.14. Man is kicked out of the garden and populates the earth.What happened is when the devil lost his holy power of creation his son Sabbaoth was given holy power by sophia and put in charge. The original creator of the mortal realm learns of beings more powerful than him lile the Father and becomes jealous of his sons position as ruler. He gathers his loyal angels and rebels against Sabbaoth but looses and is cast down to the mortal realm on mount hermon.Sabbaoth is YHWH/Jahova/God of Israelites. In Jewish teachings YHWH is one of the 7 aspects of god. The devil created 7 seraphim each representing days of the week and him symbolizing the week. When Sabbaoth was given a promotion there were only 6 days left, his day became holy.This is our backstory, pretty much all religion is based on this. These are the gods of various cultures.So at this point in the timeline mankind went from dumbed down Neanderthals to modern man. The Fallen angels land on mount hermon and jumpstart mankind in their image.We all seen ancient aliens right? The fallen angels were the Annunaki. They taught man astrology, metallurgy, alchemy, and forbidden teachings. Mankind worshipped them as Gods.This is still pre flood in the time of Jared and Enoch. Giants, Titans, Animal headed hybrids, all manner of exotic humans inhabited the earth. I believe this is when many "Tartarian" buildings were created. The Gods ruled Egypt, Greece, India, and the world was mythic with dragons and monsters. Magic was more potent.Then we have the biblical flood, the sumerian deluge and everything got reset and buried in mud. Noah divides the earth amongst his sons Ham, Shem, and Japheth.Hams people got africa/egypt and Shem was supposed to get Asia but Hams son Canaan settled there and enslaved Shems people in Egypt.The Canaanites worship the leader of the fallen angels and the original creator of this realm as god and are against Sabbaoth/YHWH the god of Israelites.Those are the two major factions, Canaanites/Baal vs Israelites/YHWH. Canaanites became Phonecians, Phonecians became Venetians, Venetians became the Illuminatti/banksters and rule from the shadows to this day.So we have the land of Canaan where the middle east is today. "Tartaria" in my opinion was like a frontier to be crossed to reach the bearing straight and to America. I believe the Giants from the land of Canaan migrated east through Tartaria then crossed into America settling in the west half. The Giants cleaned up the ancient pre flood cities, expanded on them, and used those as a base for their Empire, they dominated America. The Native Americans might be the lost tribe of Dan. Their origin starts in Asia coming from underground. They migrated through Tartaria and into America but they went south into Mexico. The spanish dropped off settlers that married into the natives and became the Aztecs, a spanish speaking native american people. The native americans then traveled northeast and settled east of the mississippi around 1200 a.d. from my research.The natives avoided the west half of America as it was the giants land. There was flooding and outbreaks of syphilis amongst the giants and their empire crumbled. The last of the giants were killed off by native americans.The Native Americans inherited America and the great cities and were in perfect harmony with nature. After the giants were gone though the Phonecian/Canaanites exterminated the natives and took their inheritance.So the first generation before the flood built amazing cities that got buried in mud, then canaanite giants clean up the cities and rule america until around 1000ish ad and get flooded again, then canaanites arrive again a few hundred years later and clean up what they can from the mud.I think the founding fathers took America from the Canaanites and set us up with guns and stuff to protect ourselves but Freemasonry and the government were infiltrated early on and run things.The elite would claim to build a building then donate it to charity as a mental institution, library, or government buildings for write offs I would assume, then they demolish them a decade later or so. Look up the Rothschilds sueing vienna, this was in the news today......still fighting over Tartarian buildings. Check out the Carnegie libraries that were donated, so much Tartaria to study.They would clean up a city and hold a world exhibition to show off the city, technology, and attract settlers. Once immigrants settled they demolish the fair, ship in orphans, and they were none the wiser. Nobody knew the ancient origins of the cities they populated except the secret societies.Lets see if this will fit. This story comes from a book a soldier wrote hundreds of years ago. He was taken captive by the Comanches and they showed him the ruins of a great ancient city to prove their belief. The soldier ends up killing the chief to escape and tell his story."Innumerable moons ago, there was a race of white men, ten feet high, and far more rich and powerful than any white people now living, who inhabited a large range of country, extending from the rising to the setting sun. Their fortifications crowned the summits of the mountains, protecting their populous cities situated in the intervening valleys. They excelled every other nation which was flourished, either before or since, in all manner of cunning handicraftwere brave and warlikeruling over the land they had wrested from its ancient possessors with a high and haughty hand. Compared with them the palefaces of the present day were pygmies, in both art and arms.""The Rolling Thunder, in order to convince me of the correctness of a belief, universal throughout the Comanche nation, conducted me to the western side of this strange valley, where I saw, with infinite astonishment and surprise, the dilapidated ruins of a large town. In the midst of the falling walls of a great number of buildings, which, in some remote age, beyond doubt, had lined spacious streets, was what appeared to have been a church or cathedral. Its walls of cut stone, two feet thick, and in some places fifteen feet high, included a space measuring two hundred feet in length, and, perhaps, one hundred in width. The inner surface of the walls in many places was adorned with elaborate carved work, evidently the labor of a master hand, and at the eastern end was a massive stone platform which seemed to have been used as a stage or pulpit. In my surprise at beholding so unexpectedly these evidences of civilization in that wild region, I turned to the Rolling Thunder and asked if he could explain it.". . . At length, in the height of their power and glory, when they remembered justice and mercy no more and became proud and lifted up, the Great Spirit descended from above, sweeping them with fire and deluge from the face of the earth. Themounds we had seen on the tablelands were the remnants of their fortresses, and the crumbling ruins that surrounded us all that remained of a mighty city.  In like manner, continued the Rolling Thunder, the day will surely come when the present white race, which is driving the Indians before it, and despoiling them of their inheritance, and which, in the confidence of its strength, has become arrogant and boastful and forgotten God, will be swept from existence."Nobody believed him, we know now that this is an accurate description of what we are currently studying now though.This feels so incomplete but I am typing on a phone and this is kinda the gist of things. Hope is gives people some leads to research. Lots of great info and researchers in the links, I watch the og researchers and share what I know in chat/comments every chance I get.Nobody is connecting the native american dots yet though that I am researching, we need more people on this, it is so interesting!

<|endoftext|>The other day I was watching a BBC documentary called Italy's invisible cities. In one episode it focused on Naples not far from Pompei. In the Herculaneum Ruins area lies an auditorium buried about 20 meters underground! that's a heck of a long way down. This was once the ground where Roman people once walked on which is now entirely buried in volcanic ash and rock. It was only discovered because 300 years ago treasure hunters were helping dig a well for the town and they stumbled across perfectly preserved Roman statues. They continued to dig and discovered an entire complex. It was pure luck it was discovered as it was so deep that no-one would've known it existed otherwise.Granted finding evidence of civilization that far deep into the ground are few and far between around the world as it normally requires a large scale event to create such a deep covering such as major volcanic eruptions. In a normal scenario over a long timeline where gradual build up of soil covering over a known civilization such as the Romans usually doesn't go very deep. Please correct me if i'm wrong but I imagine 1-5 meters at most. All you need to do is watch a Time Team episode to see archaeological digs where they find Roman era pottery, buildings and mosaics just a couple of feet below the ground.Anyway my point is archaeologists often declare they've reached the bottom and there's nothing further below. Most of the time they would be correct but if Herculaneum is anything to go by we could be missing vast amounts of history because archaeologists chose not to dig any further. To be fair in their defense every archaeological dig around the world has budget, man power, safety and time constraints and due to that its not always possible to dig deeper.Herculaneum is proof that if you dig deep enough in certain areas of the world we could find evidence of civilization, maybe potentially far older ones waiting to be discovered. It's quite exciting to think about. Mount Vesuvius erupted several times over thousands of years, what if another 20 metres down covered by an even earlier eruption there is an older civilization? We will never know as we haven't dug that far.if you consider for one moment that even with the standard gradual soil build up over a far longer timeframe it could potentially mean far older civilizations are waiting to be discovered but unfortunately it is far too far down for us to get to. As I said before archaeological digs has budget, man power, safety and time constraints.I have this theory knocking around my head that if you want to find older civilizations we need to dig as far down as we can in our modern cities. People tend to stay in areas where infrastructure is established and over many thousands of years continuously build and grow the city on top of the older city. They do not just abandon the city. Granted there are many examples of entire cities completely abandoned due to climate change, war, disease and famine but i'm willing to bet that there are more cities that has survived all that and continue to thrive to this day than then are abandoned cities around the world. These abandoned cities are now buried under the ground in middle of nowhere. These are hard to find so I think it's better and easier to focus our efforts in digging in our modern cities instead.Simply put if there's a large gathering of people in one place chances are that the area has been continuously occupied for a very very long time and that's where you have a better chance of finding evidence of far older civilizations.

<|endoftext|>It's because there is real shit out there about cyclical ages of humanity but they want you to waste time with obvious glow nagger shiz like this. Graham Hancock and Randal Carlson's work is what they're trying to obfuscate but muddying the waters, at least in my opinion. The cycle knows no regular time but looking back, all records seem to indicate that a massive civilization-leveling mega tsunami/flood happened 12000 years ago.
<|endoftext|> What I struggle with is the 400 year timeline that these cycles supposedly happen in.1) what is the oldest book you have ever held in your own hands?2) When they convinced you that 'ancient egypt' is thousands of years old, what evidence did they give you?I'm on the record as stating that [ancient egpyt is in fact an amusement park]( walks around so convinced that we have all of this 'history' going back thousands of years.Who is double checking the sources?
<|endoftext|>there was someone on youtube called Mr Truth who made videos about this.His channel was removed a couple of days ago.Does anyone know why ?
<|endoftext|>Wonder how many civilizations got too advanced and empathetic then collapsed from third world refugees.
<|endoftext|>Firstly, I dont know much about this. This mudflood you talked about, it supposedly happened somewhere late 1800s, right? Have anyone found a fitting time frame? Does Carrington event fit in that time frame?
<|endoftext|>Definitely interested in learning more about Tartaria. Those two videos that you linked were trash in regards to actually talking about that topic but it re-introduced the idea to me so I am grateful for that. The first video probably only talks about Tartary for 2 or 3 minutes then goes on a rant about Hitler/Iran and then the second only talks about Tartary for about 30s to a minute.
<|endoftext|>Mudfloods are just a misinterpretation of a building that was constructed to generate fee electricity from the Ether. It's just ZeroPoint energy-- or what I like to call *Etheron Energy*. The buildings are constructed deep into the ground to take advantage of the negative polarity of the Earth for the generation of electricity. Albeit a flood might've actually happened. I assume, many have occurred in varying degrees. And Tartary/Tartaria are one batch of Israelites. They were taken away to the heavens by "gods" ostensibly. There have been several phases of this in multiple generations before what is another global reset. It's further evidence of the power of "God" -- if you want to believe that.
<|endoftext|> The premise for Cultural Layer is that something catastrophic in very recent history (late 1700s-1800s) happened which buried buildings from a recently lost advanced civilization (which many suspect Tartaria). Many old buildings seem to have been built oddly (albeit majestically - advanced technology involved), but when you excavate them, it shows how the original buildings look which makes far more sense (ie. Half buried windows, doors, etc etc). For example, here is an extensive list of photographic evidence of this world wide phenomenon.Oh boy, this is hilarious. It's as if people jump to the most absurd conclusions from photos without doing any subsequent research or ever being to a cellar in Europe.
<|endoftext|>so, do you guys have anything other than videos? can nobody present a comprehensive timeline of events?
<|endoftext|>I thought Phantom Time was where the Holy Roman Empire added 400 years to make themselves seem more important.
<|endoftext|>Except that, aren't there tree rings that point to the dark ages? It's been almost 20 years, but I watched something back then about it, and distinctly remember the tree rings. I think it was supposedly caused by extensive volcanic activity with ash blocking the sun for an extended period of time, and that showed up in the rings as stunted growth (rings very close together).
<|endoftext|>I wanna say richard doty in mirage men, but I don't think it is. I feel like I've seen a documentary about this.
<|endoftext|>. The god of creation in genesis is the devil and is not the Father Jesus teaches of. There's a part on the old testament where the same event is described in two different sections (I think it's to do with Job), one part it's described as God doing it, the other it's described as Satan doing it.If people think logically, what kind of supreme being would order his followers to love him or make sacrifices to him? It's all about blood oathes and sacrifices then Jesus comes and says all that needs to come to an end. To me it's pretty clear the old testament "Lord" is pretty evil
<|endoftext|>Nope, nope, nope. There are several truths mixed in but not the true story of the Kingdom of Man. The simple truth is we've been around this world several times and Midway some ""gods*" came and did some genetic experiments and we self-realized. And then another set of "*Gods" created us into different races after a massive reset. And we keep going around the world ... * YHWH is Judah* Phoenicians are Canaan (from the curse of Canaan)* Bavaria/Prussia, Tartaria are all Hamitic nations. They are the Israelites re-aligned with the Canaanites in the proverbial "Land of Canaan* that were strong. (Originally coming from old Phoenician cities like Lebanon & Jerusalem from where they expanded up from Thracia [Spartacus] into Europe. * Danites are the *DAN* nations (Denmark, Sweden, Norway [Yeah, this one's confusing-- I'll give you that] * The Illuminati come from the Phoenicians/Venetians * The original Garden of Eden is in Indonesia* Neptune is under the great barrier reefJust around and around this world several times.
<|endoftext|>So good! Wish I could upvote more. 1 question so far, any idea where the number 24 comes from in your point about the angels Sophia? Also where I can I find more information about threads like this? Thank youEdit: following this, what does it all mean going forward? Like this feels very close to truth that ive experienced from studying occult topics and psychedelics. Ok. But knowing this, does that change any thing? Right now, im living with the motto of "reduce suffering" however I can. Is anyone familiar with the Ascension glossary and the false white light trap? This all seems related..
<|endoftext|>Baal creates man in the fathers image. 11. Baal is tricked by angels Sophia sent into passing his holy power to man to give him spirit. 12. Baal dumbs down mankind to try to reclaim the holy power he lost. 13. Man eats the fruit of knowledge and sobers up. 14. Man is kicked out of the garden and populates the earth.Interesting! So in this version, whom plays the role of the serpent? Or is there even a serpent at all? Eats fruit and sobers up. The fruit of knowledge is sobering? How so?Are you familiar with stoned ape theory? I often wonder if the fruit of knowledge was a psychedelic of some sort. Mushrooms or marijuana perhaps.
<|endoftext|>I gotcha', fam: 
<|endoftext|>He states in his comment that what caused the mud flood is up to debate so no, he doesnt know and doesnt even give a few theories.Honestly, I tried a few times to find more information on this but from what Ive found, its something happened, we dont know what, but something happened. If anyone can lay out a few theories, Id greatly appreciate it to.
<|endoftext|>pre Noah's flood ? so they must be thousands of years old buildings .. how come they're still intact and in use ?
<|endoftext|>Why are the election results invisible?This was my mistake, thanks for bringing it to my attention! I always take the nomination threads out of "contest mode" when the voting is done. I thought I did here, but perhaps it didn't register properly or I simply forgot.I've taken it out of contest mode...you should see that nothing untoward occurred and indeed the chosen topic was the most upvoted suggestion.
<|endoftext|>People are aware that the tartars are a people right? They aren't some myth, they were a turkic tribe absorbed by Genghis Khan
<|endoftext|>I like Hancock, have fur decades, but he muddied the water a bit all on his own. I don't think we need psychic powers to explain ancient architecture
<|endoftext|>Check out "suspicous observers" cia classified youtube video for a similar discrediting of catastrophe theories
<|endoftext|>I live in England, we have buildings that have survived various eras, from Tudor house medieval wattle and daub cottages, castles, and Neolithic henges and monuments. I believe Ancient Egypt is older than archeologists claim, based on weather erosion but thats for another thread.
<|endoftext|>1. About 1000 years old. 2. Artefacts, buildings, writings from antiquity, stone carvings, the results of carbon dating. To name just a few.Have you ever been to Egypt? Who built all these buildings in your opinion?
<|endoftext|>LOL at the STUPID fucking video. Civilization has had time to build a city near the pyramids...like are you being serious with that video? An amusement park? Wtf. Just like ANY old monument/building....civilization has had TIME to build NEAR or on TOP of old everything...come on bro. You have to be trolling.
<|endoftext|>Well, there's a statue of a dark skinned Afro man in a square in Vienna. That is in Bavaria isn't it? Or does that not have anything to do with Switzerland?
<|endoftext|>Well Switzerland is up in the Alps. Logically, if there was a big mud flood at some point, it'd affect all the lower countries more than it would the higher ones.
<|endoftext|>All of them. Not one empire still exists today. "Civilization" is a euphemistic term. How empires fool peoples into joining, whether they want to or not.You wouldn't want to be 'un-civilized', would you?Review a book "Collapse" by Jared Diamond.
<|endoftext|>The new Madrid fault line earthquake fits America pretty well. Lines up with civil war, suggesting much of the damage attributed to the war may have actually been from earthquake liquifaction.1812.
<|endoftext|> It's as if people jump to the most absurd conclusions from photos without doing any subsequent research or ever being to a cellar in Europe.You talking to me, or yourself in the mirror?
<|endoftext|>Did you just jump to an absurd conclusion? Theres countless examples at /r/CulturalLayer Whats your best guess? Im thinking space dust
<|endoftext|>Exactly, "Baal" literally means Lord and somewhere it says the Father doesn't like to be called Lord. I see Job as the god of Israelites/Sabbaoth/YHWH/Jahova vs Baal/the jealous boastful creator god in genesis. More detailed info, the 7th heaven is where the war was and when the fallen angels were cast down. Sabbaoth in gnostic texts was raised up to the 8th heaven by sophia. He is surrounded by a great cloud of fire with hosts of cherubim and seraphim praising him, Jesus Christ at his side guiding him with the spirit of wisdom. Sound familiar? Sabbaoth/YHWH is the god in visions of Ezekiel, Enoch, and the prophets. He is guided by the Father, the Holy spirit, and the Son to save this cursed world and all of us, his mission was to use foresight to shape history and bring Christ to earth to save us. The name Jesus is originally Yeshua meaning to save and deliver. Greeks translated his name to yeh-zeus and then would be pronounced "hey-seus" until the letter J was invented then became Jesus. Ever hear a mexican pronounce Jesus? They say Hey-seus still even with the J from the latinization.It always rubbed me the wrong way that "God" would tell Abraham to sacrifice his own son......but I get it now, I really get it. The Canaanites have a devotion to their god that is above all, they sacrifice their first born to Baal......now that is devotion.YHWH needed the same level of commitment and devotion to give people his power but to sacrifice your first born? How could a good loving God/Father ask that of his children? YHWH asked Abraham to sacrifice his first born and he was going to. At the very last second he spared his son, he had proven his devotion to the Father and that was enough, the child didn't actually need to die and the Israelites showed the same devotion as the Canaanites showed to Baal and that was enough to make the covenant as the chosen people. They were given very strict laws and rituals to prove their devotion so they could eventually bring the Messiah, those laws are a thing of the past now though. Jesus said he has freed us from the curse of the book of laws and there is one commandment now, love your neighbor, even love your enemy. Jesus said the old way was to love your friends and hate your enemies but he changed that. No longer is it an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth, he says it is better to just turn the other cheek.Jesus said no longer are the chosen people the only ones who can go to heaven. Gentiles, greeks, slave, free, jew, anyone can have salvation through him. He bought and paid for every one of our souls with his death, anyone can get to the father through him for seeking forgiveness. Before jesus it was strict, sin and the devil gets your soul, be perfect and you get to heaven........pretty much impossible before Jesus. Jesus even gave salvation to the dead that died as sinners before he arrived. Jesus/Yeshua literally means to save and deliver. Amongst all the deception I always know Jesus speaks truth and to use his teachings to find it.
<|endoftext|>The serpent is the beast, pretty sure they were dragons as they use to have limbs and able to speak before being cursed. The beast seems to be neutral and very wise. The devil tries to use the beast to further his agenda but the father has perfect foresight and everything happens because of his will, in the long run Jesus says in the it was good for mans destiny.I have heard the stoned ape theory, it is very interesting because in Gnostic teachings the devil dumbs down man and man was like an animal until eating the fruit of knowledge and sobering up. The Aztecs have 5 ages and it is like the same story. One of the ages man becomes monkeys. It seems man started off enlightened but then got genetically modified to be a dumb Neanderthal. Eventually the dumbed down version of man finds enlightenment, sobers up, and become modern man.
<|endoftext|>I would really prefer something written instead of another video. Why is nobody able to just write down a proposed timeline of events?1. What happened?2. When did it happen?3. What caused it?4. How was it hidden from history?5. By whom?6. For what purpose?
<|endoftext|>I think the mudfloods happened at different times on the planet. Although all cultures seem to have memories of a Noah's Ark type massive flood with just a few survivors, we don't know if they are all talking about the same event in the same time frame.After pouring over old maps, I speculate that the North American mudflood was an on-going process that began in the West in the early 1600's and culminated in the New Madrid earthquake along the Mississippi in 1812.
<|endoftext|>For context, the submission won by one vote and with the lack of transparency it smells like election rigging

<|endoftext|> consider a Flearther.. but this model makes more sense... it explains how all rivers flow from north to south, the four corners of the globe, and it explains how Australias water drains in a different directionIs this the concave earth theory or that the one that's shown with the egg shape lol

<|endoftext|>Sorry I swapped phantom time and new chronology in my head, as the both use Tartaria as a real place and not a shorthand for "horse dudes live here"
<|endoftext|>This guy knows what the fuck is up. The cycle is not 400 years. It knows no time. We live in a cosmic shooting gallery and even a relative bb gun caliber can take everything we wish to protect and cherish. The last mega destruction came at the end of the last ice age, 12000 years ago.Graham hancock will someday be seen as the genius he is. Until then we'll have to sift through the endless morass of CIA/mossad bullshit from flat earth to muh tartar sauce and on and on and on.
<|endoftext|>Also from England. I've been inside Maeshowe in the Orkneys - it's an ancient burial chamber that was raided by the Vikings and has Runic writing all over the inside. Supposedly 5000 years old. there's the Standing Stones of Stennes - also supposed to be 5000 years old.  more remote, the more untouched these places are. I recommend visiting both if you can.
<|endoftext|>Stonehenge was utterly destroyed before 1900. What you see today is an artificial monument, thanks to work done from the 1900s to 1970 it was rebuilt under the guise of restoration. How much similar rebuilding and restoration work has occurred on those other buildings you're talking about?
<|endoftext|>Vienna is Austria and flat. Switzerland has 600 year old houses perfectly fine since then. It is supposed to be a global phenomenon.And then this 
<|endoftext|>This is probably right. Idve sid 1851, just because I haven't seen any evidence before that.Have you?
<|endoftext|> You talking to me, or yourself in the mirror?Look at the section I quoted, it's as if the person who compiled those photos has never done any subsequent research into raising of street levels in their lives and would rather jump to the most absurd reasoning of some kind of completely undocumented "mud flood."
<|endoftext|> Did you just jump to an absurd conclusion? Theres countless examples at /r/CulturalLayer Whats your best guess? Im thinking space dustMany cities have raised their street levels to avoid flooding and this process is well-documented.But again, this would require somebody to do their own secondary research to learn, rather than simply jumping to absurd conclusions.[St. Petersburg]( can find countless examples, but again, that requires doing some actual research, maybe even going on a European cellar tour, or visiting municipal archives, rather than just making stuff up.
<|endoftext|>If you do check it out, I'd be glad to know what you think. There is some mind-blowing evidence, in my humble opinion, and most of the people posting impress me with their intellect and attention to details.
<|endoftext|>Beautiful. Yes this makes a lot of sense.Slightly pivoting. Are you familiar with the Sumarian creation epic? Marduk killing Kingu and using his blood to create humans etc. Is Marduk Baal? Are they similar? Following that, is this creation story just the Sumarian's version of that story you pieced together in your first post? Sounds like Sumarians and Caananites maybe the same tribes so it would make sense that they have their own version of the story
<|endoftext|>Have you ever considered applying the spiritual ideas presented in the Law of One to the religious side of this?Outside of taking the religious texts so literally, this seems quite plausible.
<|endoftext|>The ten commandments don't seem like they are from the supreme creator, as what kind of creator would be so insecure as to have to order his followers to love him and not any other god(s). A real powerful God wouldn't care if you followed anybody else as they'd know eventually they would be found out and people would come back to him.If you search for things like "old testament Lord is evil" then some resources usually come up. I think the first one I saw was some Catholic site about the Fatima messages or something like that. That site broke down how "the Lord" and some uses of "Jesus" rather than "Jesus Christ" were based on Masonic teachings and were trying to confuse people. I didn't agree with everything I read and I'm not religious at all so have no dog in the fight, but it made a lot of sense. I'm sure at one point in the OT the "Lord" says something like "I'm a jealous and vengeful God". Would the highest power really be jealous?One last thing, have you read about the god who was apparently in opposition to Buddha? I believe their name is Mara or something like that? From the description of some of the events it sounds a lot like they could be describing Mara as being the OT Lord. I seem to recall that apparently Mara arrived before other life forms on Earth so assumed they were the god of Earth.I'm interested in where other religions intersect with each other as they seem to be the most likely "truths". Do you know much about that? My knowledge of these things s pretty superficial so just wondering if you or anyone else might know more? Thanks for your response anyway
<|endoftext|> Why is nobody able to just write down a proposed timeline of events?You serious, lol? *Did you even read my comment?*
<|endoftext|>yup! Votes are usually extremely close. I have some editorial sway because this entire Round Table project was idea and I'm the one who implements it.Sometimes when it's super close I let the voting go a day or so longer just to see if one edges the other out.In this case, the chosen topic was #1 the entire time, even after letting it up for 3 days.You might not like that I have that kind of editorial sway with respect to the Round Tables, but *someone* has to be in charge.
<|endoftext|>I was wondering about this myself just this morning. Did they have an World Fairs or Expositions in the late '19th' or early '20th' Centuries?
<|endoftext|>Besides Stonehenge there are loads of Neolithic monuments that havent been touched whatsoever all over the country. Usually in remote places, which is why they havent been disturbed. There has been restoration on many old buildings and most of these are now listed so they cant be modified.(any restoration must be in keeping with the original)However many other old buildings are just ruins now, with roofs and timber beams long gone, but with much of the masonry still in place.
<|endoftext|>There is a painting by John Constable which shows how it looked in the nineteenth century. Here is an article about the work later done on Stonehenge 
<|endoftext|>There's dozens of pubs that are centuries old, the oldest ones are nearly 1000 years old. 
<|endoftext|>It is a gospel which is being kept in the Bavarian State Library.It is dated and its history is well documented in the inventory lists from the abbey it was stored in before being acquired by the library. The lists still exist and they go back centuries.Can you please answer my question about Egypt?
<|endoftext|>I totally get "not believing everything you hear" but there comes a point where being skeptical is unhealthy and counterproductive. How can you just question "how do you know it's X amount of years old" when you know there is 1. Documented science that goes into dating organic material. 2. Numerous contextual clues on culture and environmental conditions that detail the historical significance. 3. Well kept history artifacts and record-keeping in between now and then that suggest the time period did exist. Whether you agree that these are legitimate sources of information is one thing, but until you provide a scientific counter-argument or valid reasons to question their integrity (e.g flaws in carbon dating, inconsistencies in record-keeping, etc), denying them outright or questioning them is fruitless and a waste of time. If you believe they could be fake or misleading, DO THE RESEARCH AND TELL US WHY.
<|endoftext|>Vienna is a nation of Bavaria. They have distorted the true history of Bavaria so you may not know. Both world wars were to erase the Bavarian self-image in vengeance for conquering Rome. If you speak low German you are likely Bavarian.
<|endoftext|>What? Are we talking about the propsed mudflood here, which occurred some time in the early-mid 1800s & primarily affected northern Eurasia/America, or the flood of bilblical descript, aka "the deluge," which is more likely attributed to the global floods which occured toward the latter part of the Younger Dryas period?
<|endoftext|>This is too much of an emotional statement in a sub where we are supposed to be discussing things. Empathy is a good quality, but it's not without its dangers. Altruism can be so extreme it becomes harmful. So let's have the discussion without a bit more of the scientific method in mind, and keep away from all the accusations of "hate".
<|endoftext|>Yes looks great so far. Ive just scratched the surface. I will have some time this weekend to dig in.
<|endoftext|>I learn new things every day and this is my first time hearing of the Law of One and I just googled it and read some......very interesting and I have many thoughts on this.If you youtube/google DMT and Machine elf you will find an interesting cult of people that do DMT to contact beings from another dimension they refer to as Machine Elves, Clockwork Elves, or Jesters. These are what other cultures call djinn, demons, aliens, extra dimensional beings, astral beings, and so on. If you research Aliester Crowley, Magick, the occult, and the dark side of satanic religions you will understand exactly what these entities are and what tricks they can pull in our dimension from theirs. Black Magicians follow many rituals, worship 24/7, and sacrifice to these beings to make contact and a pact. Aliester Crowley suggests doing as many drugs as possible to make contact with these beings.....those are the same things people do DMT to contact and call machine elves currently.I have heard reformed occult magicians expose the tricks. You need to understand Flat Land, tesseracts, and quantum uncertainty to understand the principals. These beings are in a higher dimension and can view our whole timeline at once. They know everything that ever has, and can possibly happen to us. They can use that information against us and thread the needle of fate to influence and manipulate the flow of time to meet their agenda.They know how to manipulate us. To some they will appear as a spirit guide, to others they appear as aliens if the person is likely to believe it. To some angels, demons, djinn, machine elves, they are master tricksters. They cannot directly control us but they can influence us. They speak in first person in you own thought voice in your mind. "I could steal that and get away with that", then immediately your spirit thinks "But I would never do that". In psychology it is known as the Id and what motivates random dark impulses.Everything exists in superposition as a possibility when it comes to quantum uncertainty and things like the double slit experiment and the Schrdingers cat paradox are examples. When not viewed by an observer anything is possible, that is why magicians cover the magic happening behind a curtain. Look up vintage magic posters of the greats, look at all the little demons. A lot of time on the magicians shoulder whispering into the magicians ear. Magic is 99% smoke and mirrors, but 1% is legit magic.Maybe someone knows the trick, but take David Blaine for example. Youtube him sticking a needle through his arm, they youtube how that trick is done. It involves rubber cement and pinching the skin together to make a little pocket to slide the needle through creating the illusion of going through the arm.....but then watch David Blaine do it again, goes right through the middle. Then I forget his name but just youtube guy sticking swords through himself for a vintage black and white film of a magician sticking swords through his body.....lots of them. The theory is he knew anatomy well enough to avoid vital organs then retrace the path of the scar tissue......possible, but really?I heard a story of a man in a satanic meeting with many high members of society. He talks about a doctor that made a pact with a familiar that helps him perform surgeries that should be near impossible by passing his instruments through delicate blood vessels and such without damaging them with the same principle as passing needles and swords through the body with no blood. He makes his fortune using magic for surgery rather than stage magic for fame and money.This is turning into quite the ramble and I still haven't even got to the point I am realizing, but this part was very important as a warning to the rest of this.Jesus says this world hates us and that the father of this world is the devil. He says we are sheep amongst wolves and we should be as cunning as the serpent yet innocent as the dove. He says beware the thief in the night and if we are aware of the danger we can be gone when the robber comes.It seems important to understand the ways of the enemy but it is like the One Ring......once people learn of the power they can aquire it corrupts them completely. There is a part in the bible about spiritual gifts and how psychic powers are pretty much real but there is a chapter in the book of John that says test the spirits, and that good spirits will always praise Jesus as the father in the flesh. If you have seen the son, you have seen the Father it says. An evil spirit will always deny Jesus and curse him. I have a family member lost to these demons and their tricks so I have seen some shit. He went from loving Jesus to thinking he was Christ to hating Jesus with all his heart because of the spirits.This brings me to The Law of One. I noticed these demons sprinkle lies into the truth to suit their agenda. When I read the first part of the law of one though it is in line with the gnostic teachings I study. The history of Egypt is ancient. In a book said to be written by Seth the egyptian god he talks of Egypt as once being a land of the Gods and everything was in line with the father. But he told of a time when egypt would become a desert and full of evil. Where there were temples will be tombs.I speculate that egypt was ruled by the Gods and everything was in harmony with the father but eventually the Fallen Angels came and corrupted mankind and Egypt. The biblical flood resets everything then Noah splits the earth three ways. Ham the cursed son who had Canaan and founded the Canaanites who worship Baal was given Africa with Egypt. I imagine Hams people learned some shit in that corrupted land of the Gods and where they learned of Baal and teachings of the Fallen Angels on Mount Hermon in Shems land Asia east of the Nile. In the timeline in my head learning of these forbidden teachings is why Canaans people took Shems land and enslaved them in Egypt. Mount Hermon in important to them right by Israel/Phonecia. If the Law of one is by Ra I am skeptical for sure if it truly is inspired by truth or is a trickster impersonating it. I am totally going to read them and try to find truth or any red flags, thanks for mentioning it. Truly knowing Jesus is important, if the "Son" is mentioned and aligns with the Jesus I know then that would be a good sign. Always test the spirits.Jesus describes the Father here in a secret gnostic text. Best text ever, Jesus just exposes everything. know this got a bit off topic but worshippers of Baal are our current "controllers" and who plundered the great Tartarian cities of the giants in America and rewrote history. To understand our hidden history we need to know what the enemy faction believes and even if it just mythology to everyone else...... they believe it and is their secret religion. You can predict their moves when you know how they operate. It is literally a major world religion practiced in absolute secrecy by the elite of the elite throughout history and shaped the ancient as well as modern world. Just research Aliester Crowley and notice how many elites follow his rituals and obsess with him, he brought the ancient occult back to the modern time......this world is insane.
<|endoftext|>Sure I read it. It's very vague and then there are links to videos. It is really strange that every time this is being discussed, *nobody* can state a timeline of events. All we get are vague statements and links to videos.I really just want to know what supposedly happened and where all the mud came from. Do you know?
<|endoftext|> this change anything though? In concave earth theory, is this map still accurate?For those that dont click links, its Hitler using a flat earth map lol googled concave earth and it always looks like an egg lolI think it's safe to say, imo, that the sun and moon are moving and the earth doesnt move... does that change anything in concave earth theory? I think it's quite obvious the sun moves lol
<|endoftext|> It is a gospel which is being kept in the Bavarian State Library.Are there any links to this on their website or something? Sounds very interesting. Have you ever been to Egypt? Who built all these buildings in your opinion?If I had to guess, I'd say it was the French.
<|endoftext|> there comes a point where being skeptical is unhealthy and counterproductive. You mean it is wrong to be skeptical of the news and government?
<|endoftext|>Could you remain on point?In German there is a distinction of bayerisch and bairisch, which apparently English does not.So what about Switzerland?
<|endoftext|>The 1800 one of course when I am talking about the 600 year old houses. Beams which are c-14 dated and stood there since they constructed it. And simple castles which stand on a place where they stood since forever. Then there should be geological breakages everywhere which aren't just there. I don't know how one can believe such a weird concept.
<|endoftext|>I had a run in with this same user just a few days ago.Block this dude and move onInterestingly enough, that's exactly what I did.
<|endoftext|>wow. you are obsessed with the posting behaviour of other people. like half your comments are complaining about other users. also, why do you post in subs for teenage girls. that is fucking creepy.
<|endoftext|>Many cities have raised their street levels to avoid flooding and this process is well-documented.But again, this would require somebody to do their own secondary research to learn, rather than simply jumping to absurd conclusions.[St. Petersburg]( can find countless examples, but again, that requires doing some actual research, maybe even going on a European cellar tour, or visiting municipal archives, rather than just making stuff up.
<|endoftext|>Check out the "Rome has no surviving sources" article on there. Really interesting. The electric car one (and all the technology ones) are interesting too
<|endoftext|> I just googled it and read some......very interesting and I have many thoughts on this.Its the most wild thing I've found out there! I'm at work, and this is long, but I'll have to read later and respond!  ahead and search for terms there. Start with Jesus even! Any other questions, let em fly, I'm quite versed in this.
<|endoftext|> I noticed these demons sprinkle lies into the truth to suit their agenda. When I read the first part of the law of one though it is in line with the gnostic teachings I study. I've yet to discuss gnostic teachings with anyone who understood the Law of One and didn't place it near the top in truth. Its a different kind of channel too, they followed rigorous procedures in their channeling. Ra would only answer questions, and would not break our right to free will. The only type of questions Ra would answer were related to spiritual ideals. When the questions were not, the connection between the channel and Ra would weaken. There are many answers given on our past history though. I speculate that egypt was ruled by the Gods and everything was in harmony with the father but eventually the Fallen Angels came and corrupted mankind and Egypt. The biblical flood resets everything then Noah splits the earth three ways.When you read it, there will be no talk of anything like this though. But I encourage you to read on! (or listen, the books are free in PDF, I had an app read them to me while I drove to work) The picture painted, is more or less that all of this talk is related to religion, and religion is based on truth but smeared into a control structure. It will say there is, never was, and never will be a "god". What there is, is consciousness. The same consciousness that is your spirit, is also the same consciousness that makes up every spirit. The only "god" is the Creator, and he is you. He/she manifested everything in existence, through all of the spirits intentions, as we are all creators. You've used dimension, where Ra uses Density. So, our purpose, at this time on earth anyways, is to ascend from 3rd density to 4th density. 4th, 5th and 6th density souls do exist on earth. Millions of them incarnated into 3rd density bodies. "Human" existence is meant to last ~75K years on earth. Ra says there will be 3 harvests before the Earth will itself, ascend to a 4th density planet....with or without all of us. We happen to be right at the cusp of 75k. The biblical floods? Those were ~25k and ~50k years ago....with many "minor" ones in addition(like 12.5k ago). It is said we humans live an average of ~13 lifetimes before we manage to ascend, and when that happens, we usually reincarnate back into 3rd density bodies to "help the others". Ra says egypt was ruled by the pharaohs, and that Ra came that time, in physical form, to teach the ways of the law of one. The rulers used that power only for the elite and corrupted it. Another came to the Mayans or Olmecs(?) too, hence the pyramids at both on opposite sides of the world.What you will read, is in essence what Jesus came to tell us before. That we are here to make a choice, a choice to be of service to others, or to be of service to self(STO and STS). If "polarized" to one side far enough, you get to ascend. This is where the idea of "evil" comes from. There is no such thing as evil though. To ascend negatively you need to spend 95%+ of your life's actions acting to serve yourself, and NOT others. To ascend positively, you need to spend 51%+ of your life's actions acting to serve others. Now to make matters seemingly worse, we get to chose what life we need to live, before we incarnate to have the greatest chance to allow ourselves to ascend. Those who are on the path to ascend negatively, will chose to incarnate in, say, the Rothschild family. Our higher selves actually agree to be parents/children, to help one another in the process of making the STO/STS choice. The "sad" part, is that the STS need to do horrid things, like sacrifice to be that far STS. The less "sad" part is that the entity being sacrificed, chose to, in an effort to grow spiritually, to learn lessons.The biggest conspiracy, in my mind, is the idea of a destination, an end point. Life is not about the destination, its about the journey. You don't take your accolades into the afterlife, nor your money or fame. You take your lessons learned along the way. And there is no end to your existence in some form! In the end we are all One and will all find our way back to the Creator, both positive and negative.
<|endoftext|>What is this? This version of Jesus is so strange from the bible version  read it and the introduction for context. Will need to understand the idea of Gnosis more. Like the whole section about filled vs unfilled, what. In Gnosticism is Jesus considered a savior in the traditional Christian way or is he more of enlightened being like Buddha? Do you have any more suggested resources for this topic?
<|endoftext|>amazing read They know everything that ever has, and can possibly happen to us.so our fates are pre-determined up to a certain point?
<|endoftext|> I really just want to know what supposedly happened and where all the mud came from. I literally laid out the entire general theory/premise in my comment. Not sure if you're being serious right now, or what.
<|endoftext|> version:  I had to guess, I'd say it was the FrenchWhat exactly makes you think so?
<|endoftext|>I dont feel like the return on building the pyramid would be possible off tourists until rly recently. Where would you get stone from? If I could be convinced it was from the recent past that would be the way to start
<|endoftext|>You mean you're going to misconstrue one thing he said so you can ignore everything else he said.Obviously he wasn't talking about the 'news and government'. Maybe try reading
<|endoftext|>Being skeptical just to be a contrarian is just as irresponsible as believing everything you hear. It means youre being reactive and letting someone else control your narrative. The news/govt is good at stating opinion as fact. Its up to us to recognize that, analyze the evidence provided, explore the points of the counter argument, and make as an informed decision as possible.
<|endoftext|>What about Burgundia?The *point* you obviously misses is Bavaria  Burgundia, Austria, Hungaria are all the same and related to/allied with Tartaria. Furthermore, what you think is Swiss, was actually built by Bavarians with technology that was the same as Tartaria -- Swiss are just living in it-- they didn't build it.
<|endoftext|>Interesting!! It seems like this Law of One is also touched upon in the Ascension Glossary.  you are well versed in the Law of One - do these transmissions seem related? I'm picking out a lot of similarities going back and forth between the two. I'm just wondering if we can weave a larger narrative amongst all this seemingly related information.
<|endoftext|>There are many teachings of Jesus post resurrection where he is much more open and less cryptic. Jesus said first we much understand the physical things before we can understand the spiritual things.In his teachings after his resurrection he pretty much tells the disciples to ask him anything and he will disclose everything, spiritual truths included.The book of pistis sophia is a great example. The disciples ask him questions then he explains it in great detail then asks his disciples where was it written in holy texts? The disciples then quote from a psalm or proverb and it is just a cryptic version of what he just explained in detail, it is really amazing. You will see "Sophia" a lot in older bibles as it was the greek word for wisdom. When you put the psalms into the context of what sophia did in the gnostic stories you find that they are all already encoded in the bible. The gnostic texts feel familiar because in a sense we already know them but not in the right context.Gnosis means to have the knowledge. Having the Gnosis doesn't make one wise though for that you need understanding. Logos is the truth and understanding knowledge in a logical way. I think first we need to gain knowledge on everything we can, then once one has the Gnosis they can apply Logos to it and reach the state of understanding and finally gaining wisdom of the subject. It takes a while before things start really making logical sense. I would read ancient books and not understand it at all, but then I would read something and think "oh wait, I read something related to this before!", then I would go back and reread texts and then it makes perfect sense since I gained more knowledge since reading it before. Now I read things and I instantly remember many puzzle pieces related to the subject. For instance I just learned of Cahokia the native american city bigger than london that got abandoned and flooded, the place with the mounds. I already know of the whole history but didn't know of that city, it connected sooooo many dots. That is the city the natives lived in when the great spirit warned them of a flood and they left it to settle higher ground. That is the flood that wiped out the giants and the natives say the giants cities are buried under the mounds. The mounds are build on multi level previous structures and they found giant bones buried in them. The multi level structures are collapsed buildings that got buried in the mounds like the natives claim. I love when there is physical evidance of "mythology"
<|endoftext|>In a sense yes but it is like threading the needle of fate from how I understand it. Just because something is possible doesn't guarantee that their ritual will be a success. Aliester Crowley's book "magick in theory and practice" describes magick like this:"(Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my knowledge. I therefore take "magical weapons", pen, ink, and paper; I write "incantations" --- these sentences --- in the "magical language" i.e. that which is understood by the people I wish to instruct; I call forth "spirits", such as printers, publishers, booksellers, and so forth, and constrain them to convey my message to those people. The composition and distribution of this book is thus an act of MAGICK by which I cause changes to take place in conformity with my Will<<By "Intentional" I mean "willed". But even unintentional acts so-seeming are not truly so. Thus, breathing is an act of the Will-to-Live.) II. "POSTULATE." ANY required Change may be effected by the application of the proper kind and degree of force in the proper manner through the proper medium to the proper object. (Illustration: I wish to prepare an ounce of Chloride of Gold. I must take the right kind of acid, nitro- hydrochloric and no other, in sufficient quantity and of adequate strength, and place it, in a vessel which will not break, leak, or corrode, in such a manner as will not produce undesirable results, with the necessary quantity of Gold: and so forth. Every Change has its own conditions. In the present state of our knowledge and power some changes are not possible in practice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance, or transform lead into tin, or create men from mushrooms. But it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature; and the conditions are covered by the above postulate.)"So imagine being an Angel and seeing every possibility that can happen, certain things are impossible and just can't be done, but if the possibility exists then there is a certain course of actions that must take place to achieve that goal and that is a magic ritual to make the casters will a reality.Modern magick goes all the way back to the Fallen angels of mount hermon and Baal, they brought man astrology and rituals to summon demons. Ham's people were the Egyptians but pre flood Egypt was ruled by "gods" and Hams people learned of the pre flood angels in egypt there from how I understand the timeline. Hams son Canaan took Shems land and based around mount hermon because it is sacred to the occult......it is pretty much mount doom in lord of the rings terms.Jerusalem was a Canaanite stronghold called Jebus before King David conquered it and is near mount hermon. When Solomon was king, as the story goes, he had to construct his temple without metal tools but that seemed impossible. Solomon goes up a mountain and meets with a demon to ask how to do that, the demon didn't want to tell Solomon so he used his magic signet ring to bind the demon to his will and force it to divulge his secret. The demon reluctantly tells him that there is a worm in a rainforest that eats stone and he must use them to cut the stone for the temple. Solomons seal was most likely a pentagram pointing up, but satanists cant the pentagram so it points down and resembles a goats head. That is why those symbols are always connected to magic and summoning demons. I know a christian that made a canted pentagram in his own blood just to mock me. He started having night terrors, sleep paralysis, and began being plagued by shadow people (never had them before and started immediately after the ritual). He started doing meth to stay away since he became too afraid to sleep which made it worse. It got so bad he finally just gave himself over to the shadow people and let them have his body. He calls that his birthday and after that he developed a hate for Jesus is now a full blown satanist. Yeah.....I have seen some crazy shit and I know demons exist.Solomon eventually summons 72 demons and learns all about their ways before forcing them to work on his temple. Solomon tried everything to be happy but learned with total wisdom that is just not possible. Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines (lol). He eventually falls for a Jebucian woman from former Jebus so she was a canaanite. The priest of Baal told him he must worship Moloch by crushing a few grasshoppers together to marry her. Solomon resists the temptation for a while but eventually he gives in and does the ritual and worships Baal. He says at that moment wisdom fled him and he became a fool.So the connection in mount hermon, egypt, then Jerusalem in terms of occult knowledge and demonic magic. Black magicians use Solomons rituals known as enochian magic (that I assume Solomon learned from Enoch's teachings as he knew the language of angels and how to summon them) to summon demons and learn forbidden information to help them with their rituals to make their will reality.Aliester Crowley used this magick to summon demons and relearn all the forgotten forbidden teachings. There is a defense though, Jesus. Magic won't work on anyone who has the protection of Jesus as he has authority over all demons. John Ramirez, an ex satanist specializing in santeria from Haiti (Haitians have canaanite roots) and he left the craft because the devil himself told him to give up when he tried to curse a christian saying that christians have protection from a higher power. When he learned of a higher power than the devil he gave himself over to Jesus and exposes satanic magic to atone. His testimony is amazing  is guided by the son Jesus who is part of the father and no matter how crafty the devil is, YHWH has perfect foresight and the devils plans always end up working against himself in the long game.Jesus says we are sheep amongst wolves and that we should be cunning as the serpent yet as innocent as a dove. He says to beware the thief in the night and if we know their plans we can pack our stuff and not be there when the thief arrives.I learned a ridiculous amount about the occult and magick in order to know how they work and to expose them, I want to mess up their rituals. I was scared to study the dark arts worrying that I might get corrupted by it. I promised god that I would never use magick even if I thought it was for a noble reason and to this day that holds true. Honestly I don't even feel tempted, I hate magick.Warning: I got arrogant and thought since I have Jesus's protection I would be immune to magick, I mocked demons. That is true but even though demons can't directly hurt me, they can possess others and try to hurt me through them. In a way I feel cursed since I know so much about the enemy and the knowledge I have is dangerous to their agenda so I have a target on my back. For example I have been doused in gasoline with my cat in my car by a satanist family member that tried to burn me alive over a delusion, but when he tried to ignite the lighter it got soaked in gas and would not spark so I escaped......miracle right? I had lived such a blessed and amazing life before this. The amount of random bad stuff that happened to me in the past 10 years is unreal though and I am playing against a stacked deck now, but I don't regret anything. If I can expose what I know and screw over canaanites than it is all worth it. Oddly I am a very positive an loving person still even after everything that has happened. I have faith that everything that has happened to me is for a reason and I wouldn't be the person I am today without all these trials, they just help me to become wise in the long run so I am at peace with my life.
<|endoftext|>oh ffs this is getting nowehere. There is a Switzerland **today** and there are buildings which are 600 years old without any gaps in their documentation; there are excavations of Roman leftovers just 1.5 to 3 meter under todays Basel right in the linked article; there are Celtic remains which are dated by c-14 before the Romans at the same place. What is your problem?And how does this  fit into that theory?
<|endoftext|> lol, all you got is "raised streets"? Always fumbling, aren't ya?That was the information relevant to the section I quoted. You asked for examples, I provided them.If you are unwilling to look at evidence presented, then I'm not really sure this discussion has any purpose ...
<|endoftext|> do these transmissions seem related?What 2 transmissions besides the Law of One? There have been countless channeling sessions by many many people.
<|endoftext|>so much knowledge in your posts.. i'll have to go back and reread all of them. thanks much for sharing
<|endoftext|>hi again, i was reading about the Brotherhood of the Snake the other day ( and am rereading your posts and would like to know more.. where do the following factor in this?- Ea/Enki (our true creator according to certain theories) and Enlil - sun worship- saturn worship
<|endoftext|> You asked for examples, I provided them.Those are not examples of the type of work shown in the above pictures. The St Petersburg page is just saying, its gets flooded by the river. The Chicago one is just saying that streets were lowered. No pictures showing it. That Prague page is just saying that there are cellars.
<|endoftext|> That was the information relevant to the section I quoted. You asked for examples, I provided them.I'm aware of revisionist history. If you are unwilling to look at evidence presentedYou're fumbling and projecting, like always. Come back when you have an original thought. Sound good?
<|endoftext|>IMO the mud had to come from above,like a mud rain from above the firmament. The liquefaction explanation doesn't do it for me because then the buildings are somehow remaining perfectly level while sinking in the ground. There are some images that look like the mud comes in more like a mud slide but that could just as easily be mud rain running from higher elevation to lower elevation. Another option I'm considering is some sort of weapon that would liquefy hills/mountains surrounding these targeted areas and the mud would flow down and bury the town that way.
<|endoftext|>I was really into sumerian mythology in the late 2000's so I know a bit and have thought on this a lot. I always try to cross reference legends from other religions and see how it connects with the gnostic truth and bible.When it comes to the sumerian gods they appear to be the Archons. In Gnostic texts Yaldabaoth was the first ruler and father of the gods. He had 12 sons referred to as archons (seraphim class angle I think) but 7 were special and represented days of the week and Yaldabaoth represented the week as a whole. Sabbaoth was one of the 7 archons but Sophia poured some of her light in him and he took over as ruler when Yaldabaoth rebelled became death, and his Angel's were cast down to Mount Hermon in Syria right next to Iraq.YHWH is one of the 7 aspects of the hebrew god and his day is holy and called the Sabbath. I believe Sabbaoth is YHWH and was one of the 7 archons based on the numbers and connections.How does this relate to sumerian gods? Enki was one of 7 sons of Anu (father of sumerian gods) and was one of the underworld judges. sounds pretty familiar to me, father of gods, seven offspring.Phoenicia is west of mount hermon, Canaan was north, sumer was east of it. Gnostics teach the fallen Angel's landed on mount hermon and they taught mankind forbidden teachings and advanced mankind. Sumerians believe gods came from heaven to earth and taught them everything they know, and just east of mount hermon, I believe this is all connected.The seven Gnostic archons are:The name of the first is Athoth, whom generations call the reaper.The second is Harmas, who is the jealous eye.The third is Kalila-Oumbri.The fourth is Yabel.The fifth is Adonaios, who is called Sabaoth.The sixth is Cain, whom generations of people call the sun.The seventh is Abel.The eighth is Abrisene.The ninth is Yobel. The tenth is Armoupieel.The eleventh is Melcheir-Adonein.The twelfth is Belias, who is over the depth of the underworld.Seven offspring of the father of gods, one rules over the underworld, and the other is worshipped and "the sun". Sounds a lot like the anunnaki to me. I think the Archons ended up as gods of the major religion and became the Sumerian Anunnaki since sumer is near mount Hermon where the fallen Angel's landed, I see Kalila and think Kali from the hindu religion. Whenever I hear of sun worship I think of the Archon called the sun.I always think of the canaanite god Baal when I think about Enlil since Enlil sent the flood to eliminate mankind and credited with bringing technology to mankind. Enki on the other hand saved mankind from the flood and wanted mankind to practice peace and birth control. I often wonder if Enki was Sabbaoth before Sophia poured her light on him and gave him the holy power but I just am not sure. I don't see anything about human sacrifice to enki so I don't relate him to canaanite worship or the occult.Before the flood things were different, there was the era with 8 kings that reigned from 18,000 to 42,000 years each, these are the "titan" mudfossils I think. During this era is when the fallen Angel's landed on mount hermon and the ancient world wide cities were first created. Sabbaoth would have been a normal archon in those days before he denounced his father and had Sophia's light poured on him. I think it is possible that there is a connection with YHWH/Sabbaoth and Enki but I haven't found enough evidence to be sure. It wasn't until after the flood and Ham/Canaans people learned of the fallen angels/anunnaki and worshipped them as gods again. Gnostic, zoroastrianism, and sumerian mythology is all very connected and geographically are right by mount hermon/syria/iraq.Also after reading about the brotherhood of the snake it is pretty much what the gnostics teach. It is amazing how many times I read something and think about the gnostic truth. Game of thrones has the 7 gods, the great other, and lord of light. G.R.R. Martin said they are inspired by the cathars and their religion which was the gnostic truth. I read the Silmarillion from Tolkien and it is the same story, the original story.
<|endoftext|>Yikes, sorry that you are unable to do secondary research for yourself. The links clearly outline why buildings/streets look like that, hopefully you take a closer look for yourself.
<|endoftext|> I'm aware of revisionist history.It's not revisionist, you can look at municipal archives yourself ... You're fumbling and projecting, like always. Come back when you have an original thought. Sound good?A bunch of photos with absurd claims aren't evidence. Not sure why you are resorting to personal attacks when confronted with evidence, really weird.
<|endoftext|>I agree that the fact that you're jumping to personal attacks to make yourself appear authoritative is childish. From my screen I'm pretty sure you're about 14 years old. If you believed in these theories on anything other than unsupported claims that sound cool to you, then you would consider the alternative evidence proposed and refute logically.Its a shame, I'd never heard of Tartaria and was excited to learn, but the person leading the conversation is so obviously not of a scientific or investigative mind that I'm also inclined to categorize all of this as another crackpot theory. Not only that, but your attitude makes your sources look like pure sophistry as well. Great job on destroying your cause.
<|endoftext|> The liquefaction explanation doesn't do it for me because then the buildings are somehow remaining perfectly level while sinking in the ground.Also if that much liquefaction happened, many of the buildings would be destroyed, half destroyed. The earth won't just move slowly like that.
<|endoftext|>Yes, I've been to that site before. Many people have linked terms though it. I was not aware it was considered a transmission, thought it was just a wiki of sorts. Is everything there just one persons channeling? If so I have not read through her work.
<|endoftext|>hmm i haven't made up my mind on gnosticism for now. the fact that it forms the spiritual foundation of unsavory cults and secret societies who are responsible for many atrocities, doesn't sit well with me. thanks for the otherwise fantastic read as always
<|endoftext|>Lol really? Science is essentially math, which can be verified by anyone. This is what I mean by you just wanting to be a contrarian. What do you believe then? I certainly think there is more to life than we are told by others and more to our existence than the human brain can understand, but there are clear truths that you are dismissing just because a majority of others believe them
<|endoftext|>Because there are many forms of shared human knowledge. "Science" is one story about how the world works. You don't have to have faith in a completely materialist universe to understand the application of Newtonian physics when a trebuchet is outside your castle walls. You just need to accept the consensus reality that a boulder is coming for your head or else. If you just want to sit there and say "bUT gRaVItTY iS JuST a tHeORy" because the crowd is telling you to move, don't act so persecuted when we make fun of you.
<|endoftext|> sorry that you are unable to do secondary research for yourself.More like the pages you show give no reason to dig any further. The pictures the other guy posted on the other hand.... The links clearly outline why buildings/streets look like thatNo, it clearly outlines why St Petersburg gets flooded, it clearly outlines that changes were made to Chicago as it populated.
<|endoftext|> From my screen I'm pretty sure you're about 14 years old.You apparently haven't been here often then.
<|endoftext|>Yea the formatting is kind of strange, as it's a glossary weaved together from transmissions that sound seemingly familiar with the Law of One process when I visited the site you linked. I was familiar with Law of One via this glossary but didnt realize others were receiving similar transmissions and that there was a whole website for Law of One.From the Ascension Glossary page:Lisa Renee experienced a spontaneous[Kundalini](event several years ago that catalyzed a[Starseed](Awakening to perceive multidimensional realities and communication with the Evolutionary forces of Light. Lisa Renee has been personally contacted and then prepared, trained and downloaded by Interdimensional beings (Extra-terrestrial and Ultra-terrestrial, not from this Universe) known as the[Krystal Star](and[Aurora](Guardians. Guided by Guardians, Lisa was biologically upgraded to be downloaded to comprehend the Science of Ascension through the[Law of One](and its dynamics upon the layers of energy fields. This understanding of Consciousness Technologies was experienced by her own personal evolution and began her transition into an Multidimensional Guide and God-Sovereign-Free (GSF) Steward during this Planets Ascension Cycle.

<|endoftext|> the application of Newtonian physicsPeople understood practical mechanics before Newton, you do realise this, right?
<|endoftext|>I literally told the person to dig further. You can go to municipal archives and find out why former street-level floors are now underground. You can go on tours to see how and why this took place.Have you done this? What did you find? Why do you disagree with centuries of municipal data, recorded information regarding street raising and tangible information regarding the increased street levels?Show *your* research.
<|endoftext|>how does your world model explain sunrises, seasons and the fact that northern constellations cannot be seen from the southern hemisphere?can you post a map of the world, please?
<|endoftext|> I was familiar with Law of One via this glossaryThe Law of One from the site I linked is a bit different than what is explained here. Its both a way of living, as Lisa puts it, and also the name given to the whole channeling effort to receive the Law of One from Ra, a 3+ year effort from 1981-1984.They actually recorded them on cassette tapes, and recently released the first batch of them on youtube: Lisa Renee has been personally contacted and then prepared, trained and downloaded by Interdimensional beings known as the Krystal Star and Aurora Guardians. Guided by Guardians, Lisa was biologically upgraded to be downloaded to comprehend the Science of Ascension through the Law of One and its dynamics upon the layers of energy fields.This whole description does concern me though. Biologically upgraded? The Law of One I know, truth would not come in that way. That would violate Free Will. But un-truths can come in that way, by those entities trying to lead us astray. A lot on her site is "history" related, galactic wars and such, but with a tone of fear mongering, as if we always have to be afraid of those things happening.  and the externalization of the Krystal Star presence (the Cosmic Christos Unity Consciousness) is beginning now to rehabilitate the organic Timelines for the GSF Ascension timeline made for preserving human sovereignty on the planet earth.From the Krystal Star page. This only even makes sense from a perspective outside of time. Time is time, when you exist within it. Outside of it, not so much. And this is completely different from the Ascension spoken in The Law of One. Our earth is ascending, there is no rehabilitation needed. As All is One, everything you see is conscious, has a soul, and ascends itself in due time. Fire/earth/water/air even. All plants, all animals, all humans....all planets. We are in the time that Earth is ascending. The Starseeds are here to help bring the planets vibration along. Once the earth has finished ascending to 4th density, there is no worry for "human sovereignty". We are all souls, and all souls are eternal, if we ourselves don't ascend to the next density here, we get to somewhere else. Those that do ascend to 4th density positive, will get to reincarnate here.
<|endoftext|>This is getting ridiculous. No one has to tell you that, it's something you observe every day. How do you think any technology works? Random guesses and super powers? I think it's time for you to enlighten everyone on the truth and why these basic concepts are lies.
<|endoftext|>Hence the most and if the same exact practice is the one disproving and self checking itself then its okay to be wrong sometimes.
<|endoftext|>Show your research. Problem of course being that they have not done any. Hilariously maybe 10 of the linked photos are buildings a few decades old with a very recent mudslide piled up next to them.
<|endoftext|> Why do you disagree with centuries of municipal dataI don't. I'm here to attempt to understand the theory presented in this thread, not to argue with those who don't believe it. All you have said is go research. No thanks, thats why I'm here, for the answers. If you don't have them, someone else will. Show your research.I just did. The pictures I saw hold more weight to something not being true than what you presented being the reasoning.
<|endoftext|>Appreciate the reply. So far Im enjoying this Ra channeling. Reading it bit here n there. Going to check out the YouTube link you mentioned. It's always great to take in more about these subjects.A lot on her site is "history" related, galactic wars and such, but with a tone of fear mongering, as if we always have to be afraid of those things happening. So about that. I found her website following a rabbit hole when researching the False White Light concept, which is kind of the core of what her fear mongering is about per say. On her site, she explains that there are these certain entities which enforce a kind of control grid on our planet. These archons, supposedly prey on our negative vibrations while we live on earth and when we die they try to trick us into reincarnation so that cycle continues to feed them. From my understanding, if one can understand love, compassion, forgiveness, etc. we may be able to bypass this false white light and ascend.Anyway her site mentions Law of One but as you say, it seems to have some contradictory info to your understanding of Law of One. Maybe Lisa's transmission is more tricky than truthy. Are you familiar with the False White Light concept?
<|endoftext|>Math is most certainly not science. Math doesn't explain anything, it only quantifies things. I find it especially ironic that you say that, considering our realm is one unified field. E=MC^2 but Einstein didn't bother to actually define energy, mass or speed.
<|endoftext|> I just did. The pictures I saw hold more weight to something not being true than what you presented being the reasoning.So some pictures which are easily explained by centuries of municipal data, visible evidence and extensive documentation somehow bear more weight in your mind than that data, evidence and documentation?Seems like you just want to believe whatever you want. You've already admitted that you aren't going to do any research, really weird for a user on this sub tbh.
<|endoftext|> Are you familiar with the False White Light concept?Just barely enough. I think its related to the idea of Loosh energy. But to me it doesn't make a lot of sense. Every baby that is born has a soul, they don't need to "trap" us to keep us coming back. There WILL be souls reincarnating on earth, without that effort. From what I understand, very few ascend, most of us will have to come back, or go elsewhere. Why would they want a more advanced soul to Loosh energy off of, rather than a less experienced soul who is more likely to feed into that Loosh energy? I kinda feel like the notion that this exists, is a misunderstanding of what is happening. For instance, there is this passage in the Law of One:51.1  Questioner: As we begin Book Three of The Law Of One there are a couple of questions, one of fairly non-transient importance and one which I consider to be a bit transient that I feel obligated to ask because of communication with others.The first is just clearing up final points about harvest for our friend [name]. And I was wondering if there is a supervision over the harvest and if so, why this supervision is necessary and how it works since an entitys harvestability is the violet ray? Is it necessary for entities to supervise the harvest, or is it automatic? Could you answer this, please?Ra: I am Ra. In time of harvest there are always harvesters. The fruit is formed as it will be, but there is some supervision necessary to ensure that this bounty is placed as it should be without the bruise or the blemish.There are those of three levels watching over harvest.The first level is planetary and that which may be called angelic. This type of guardian includes the mind/body/spirit complex totality or higher self of an entity and those inner plane entities which have been attracted to this entity through its inner seeking.The second class of those who ward this process are those of the Confederation who have the honor/duty of standing in the small places at the edge of the steps of light/love so that those entities being harvested will not, no matter how confused or unable to make contact with their higher self, stumble and fall away for any reason other than the strength of the light. These Confederation entities catch those who stumble and set them aright so that they may continue into the light.The third group watching over this process is that group you call the Guardians. This group is from the octave above our own and serves in this manner as light-bringers. These Guardians provide the precise emissions of light/love in exquisitely fastidious disseminations of discrimination so that the precise light/love vibration of each entity may be ascertained.Thus the harvest is automatic in that those harvested will respond according to that which is unchangeable during harvest. That is the violet-ray emanation. However, these helpers are around to ensure a proper harvesting so that each entity may have the fullest opportunity to express its violet-ray selfhood. From my understanding, if one can understand love, compassion, forgiveness, etc. we may be able to bypass this false white light and ascend.As far as this goes, you can ONLY ascend when you have shown an understanding of Love/compassion/forgiveness. We are here to grow spiritually, if we don't grow enough, we get to come back. And when we come back its a choice we make, we choose the life we feel will give us an opportunity to grow spiritually.
<|endoftext|>If it is unified, which I also believe it is, everything would be connected by math problems/algorithms defined by science. They go hand in hand, like physics. The point is that this guy refuses to justify his skepticism. I wish he would so those with an open mind could see his perspective.
<|endoftext|> So some pictures which are easily explained by centuries of municipal data...which I haven't seen... bear more weight in your mind than that data, evidence and documentation?Exactly. Seems like you just want to believe whatever you want.To believe something, I'd need to come to a conclusion. So far, I've just seen 2 sets of "data". 3 web pages from you, dozens of pics from Putin, and several forums, sites, and videos from the others here.

<|endoftext|>Look at the information on offer here. Its disgusting that the only sensible debate on 5G has to be done in a conspiracy forum. I am a member so I dont mean that in a derogatory way to this sub but it blows my mind that anywhere you try and being up the discussion for 5g you are instantly labelled a nut case. It speaks volumes that before its even fully rolled out any comment on 5G in big forums like The daily Mail comments section (which is massive) you get attacked. Should we not be allowed to discuss the concerns of thousands of ACTUAL scientists who vent worries and concerns which vary in nature. Nope 5G is not open for discussion, not mentioned and I hope you are all noticing the lampposts in your areas getting worked on? I live in a rural village in south east England and we have had workmen during the lock down working on lampposts. My understanding is you will see a big mast and then lots of little routers will be placed in lampposts in order to get their 5meter distance shit. This is all to pinpoint where we all are and what we are doing. Current tech only allows them to see between masts as a rough location to where you are once 5g is rolled out they can precisely tell where you are and probably know what your thinking. The fact the MSM, google etc are not open to discussion tells me everything I need to know. Google 5g is bad and all you get is Negative stories like conspiracy nuts burn down mast. Conspiracy theorists are dumb. I think most of us here know how Google (YouTube) work by now. When TPTB have shit to hide google is fully compliant. You tube was informative before Google took it over.
<|endoftext|>You know what I've been looking into things and getting heat from lots of conspiracy theory people because I usually can't see any scientific or statistical data to back up most of what they say.

<|endoftext|>Key conclusions from this paper based on a conglomeration of studies:Very important point first of all: US safety regulations are based ONLY on thermal effects. The following are all considered non thermal effects. -All the studies reviewed here were of Wi-Fi using the 2.4 GHz band, although there is also a 5 GHz band reserved for possible Wi-Fi use.-Telecommunications industry-linked individuals and groups have claimed that there are no and cannot possibly be any health impacts of Wi-Fi (Foster and Moulder, 2013; Berezow and Bloom, 2017). However with Wi-Fi exposures becoming more and more common and with many of our exposures being without our consent, there is much concern about possible Wi-Fi health effects. This paper is not focused on anecdotal reports but rather on 23 controlled, scientific studies of such health-related effects in animals, cells including human cells in culture and in human beings - This study put pairs of young mice into cages on the ground at two locations each with somewhat different exposures within an antenna park. The exposure levels at both sites were well within safety guidelines, so if the safety guidelines have any biological relevance, there should have been no apparent effects. It takes about 30 days for mice to go through gestation. At the higher level exposure, the pairs produced one litter of lower than normal size, and a second litter with lowered numbers of progeny; after that they were completely sterile or had extremely low fertility (Magras and Xenos, 1997). At the other site, the mating pairs produced four litters, with decreasing numbers of progeny over time followed by complete sterility. In both groups, the mating and possible subsequent gestatation for the fifth possible litter were performed under conditions of no EMF exposure, but the fertility effects were not reversed; therefore fertility effects may become irreversible, suggesting a similar pattern to the brain related effects of EMFs.-Repeated Wi-Fi studies show that Wi-Fi causes oxidative stress, sperm/testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG changes, apoptosis, cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload. Each of these effects are also caused by exposures to other microwave frequency EMFs, with each such effect being documented in from 10 to 16 reviews. Therefore, each of these seven EMF effects are established effects of Wi-Fi and of other microwave frequency EMFs.-Each of these 7 is very serious: Oxidative stress has causal roles in most chronic human diseases; cellular DNA damage can cause cancer, thus producing a partial explanation for EMF cancer causation; because such DNA damage occurs in sperm cells (Atasoy et al., 2013, Avendao et al., 2012, Akdag et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2014, Asghari et al., 2016), such damage is highly likely to produce mutations that impact future generations; calcium overload is highly likely to be the cause of each of these various other effects, as discussed below; apoptosis has central roles in neurodegenerative diseases; the neuropsychiatric effects are almost certainly caused by the impact of EMFs on brain structure which is extensively documented and, in my opinion, produces many impacts (Pall, 2016b). A recent meta-analysis shows major lowering of sperm counts and sperm quality in many countries around the world, with declines of over 50% in all advanced technology countries (Levine et al., 2017). The senior author of this study suggested that this effect alone may lead to human extinction.- The impacts of such EMFs on animal brains were reviewed in Tolgskaya and Gordon (1973) and discussed in Pall (2016b). Initially exposures over period of 12 months produced relatively modest changes in structure of the brain and the neurons and when exposures ceased, most of the structural changes disappeared  that is the changes were largely reversible. However more months of exposure produced much more severe impacts on brain and neuronal structure and these were irreversible (Tolgskaya and Gordon, 1973, Pall, 2016b).-We have therefore reason to think that such effects as brain damage to animal brains, neuropsychiatric effects in humans, reproductive dysfunction in mice and mutational effects, are each cumulative. Those same effects may be completely or largely irreversible.It is quite long, and quite scary IMO. Theyve known for a very long time how harmful this shit is. It also goes on to debunk a ton of studies that came to any conclusion about emfs not being harmful.  a great read is The Body Electric. A book by Robert O Becker.

The only thing I disagree on is your closed mindedness and absolute adoration for this new tech.

<|endoftext|>Damn, the reference they used was deleted: 
<|endoftext|>I saw a video just a week or so ago. I just youtubed 5g and bees. There was a video with two towers pretty close together. Either one or both towers was purposefully disguised to look like a tree. And that kinda tells me something is deceptive about this whole thing. Nobody asked for 5g. But another thing that caught my eye was the fact that there were dozens of bees lying dead in between the towers. Lots of them. The guy in the video even sees one in flight just nosedive. And then I remembered those news stories from at least a couple of years ago when bees, birds, fish, etc. kept dying in massive numbers but no one knew why. There may be a connection here. And I agree, you get rid of bees, we will not live much longer as a species. Bees are the only ones that can pollinate a great portion of the food we eat. Even the foods other animals eat. Humans can hand pollinate, but are nowhere near as accurate as bees.
<|endoftext|>Birds and whales, sonar and radar and telecommunications. Bees, colony collapse disorder. To answer your question: have not looked into it fully, but it definitely has an environmental impact on animals. Let me see if I can dig up that study I found the other day. Will reply again in a minute.
<|endoftext|>Can't say about 5G but there's this old documentary, beings of frequency which shows the adverse effects of radio towers on living things. Like how the cancer rates in the world has gone up drastically after building mobile towers all over the world. And how it has affected the basic frequency of earth (schumann resonance). Basically it talks about how much frequency affects living beings and how important frequency is. : link to scientific American blog detailing how 5G isn't safe 
<|endoftext|>Well, 5G uses the same UHF frequencies as normal analogue TV used for the best part of 60 years, so the data should be out there, somewhere
<|endoftext|>[Yes, this is a phenomenon that is backed up by Science.]( to be clear, guidelines on radiation limits have been in place since the 90s, have not been updated with subsequent rollouts of technology - and are ONLY to do with breaking ionic bonds (hence ionizing radiation) and damaging DNA; they make no mention whatsoever of the effects of electromagnetic fields beyond that.[This study]( only touches upon fields produced by electric pylons; it concludes that...acute exposure to ELF EMFs impacts upon the motor and cognitive abilities of bees and reduces feeding. We show, for the first time, that acute exposure to ELF EMFs causes a dose dependent reduction in olfactory learning. High levels of ELF EMFs, that can be experienced close to power lines, modify tethered flight by increasing wingbeat frequency. In addition, we show that exposure to low-level fields, at intensities found at ground levels below power lines, significantly reduces the number of successful foraging flights to a food source, and also leads to reduced feeding in bees. I am amazed that people still think that bees, a tiny creature that lives in the air and uses magnetic fields for guidance, wouldn't be adversely affected by large amounts of high frequency energy being fired through the air.

<|endoftext|>One of the things I think everyone has missed about this patent is one of the links that is cited as a reference for the patent which is the following  its from a company named Neurogress that is using neural link technology with the endgame of allowing a user, through the help of machine learning AI, to move robotics with the power of thought alone. In my estimation it looks like Microsoft is offering a cryptocurrency chip with the incentive of money to do arbitrary tasks in order to have a global Machine learning AI neural network to exponentiate a possible robotics program. But thats just my theory :)
<|endoftext|>"For example, a brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, such as viewing advertisement or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process." - from the Summary \[0005\], under Description.Very interesting, and concerning.

For me there was too loud about Flat Earth for example (i think this one is totaly ridiculus) and repeating "5G causing Coronavirus" when it started form something totaly diffrent. As I remember it was rather like "5G is possible to create health problems which may be close related to lungs problems which are seen on covid patients" And now everywhere in media: "5G creating coronavirus conspiracy" !

<|endoftext|>Loose take on the idea of sacred geometry purely as an amateur. The symbolism behind the triangle. A simple shape. 3 sides 3 angles, 3 intersecting lines all meeting to form a union. I've been doing a lot of reading and "digging" and above all the triangle is one of the most dominant shapes I've encountered above all. Ever look at the banner or r/pizza recently?

Fascinating stuff regardless. History is cool.
<|endoftext|>Reminds me of this drawing which is in the book The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life 
<|endoftext|>I would say that it relates to Sacred Geometry in that Sacred Geometry can be seen all around us.If Sacred Geometry is the map, this would talk about (as in around) the Keys.

I'll occasionally hand pollinate cuz I kinda enjoy it, but damn those bees get *after it*. And not just bees, other small insects too. They are buzzing from flower to flower **all day** and digging around in there spreading all the pollen. Humans cannot come close to matching their capacity
<|endoftext|>Those stealth towers are usually there because of an ordinance or by landowner request; cell companies would prefer cheaper, cookie cutter, standard sites then those things. An example would be a fake palm tree tower near a beach to not be an eyesore, or a fake pine tree cell site, to not be an eyesore, usually in or near a park. &#x200B;Birds do die more often near guyed tower sites, often from flying into the guy wire. This doesn't apply to non guyed structures. &#x200B;I am an installer in the industry.&#x200B;As to the bugs, wasps don't seem to have an issue, maybe they are more angry then usual, hard to tell with wasps. They are assholes in the best of times. Gnats often swarm near older, lower band antenna, though this is less and less common, as more and more antenna are multiple band jobs. &#x200B;I don't often see bees around tower sites, though I should point out that does not mean never.
<|endoftext|>Yeah for sure. I'm thinking this might be a better approach when talking to the naysayers. It's easier for something to think "well it doesn't affect *me* therefore it's fine, I don't notice anything from the current cell towers". I mean I think there are substantial effects that we just can't really feel, but it's hard to convince someone of that who disagrees. So mentioning bees and other animals that use the EM spectrum might be a good approach
<|endoftext|> It has been shown that low intensity microwave/lower frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) act in animals via activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in the plasma membrane, producing excessive intracellular calcium \[Ca\]i, with excessive \[Ca\]i leading to both pathophysiological and also in some cases therapeutic effects. The pathophysiological effects are produced largely through excessive \[Ca2+\]i signaling including excessive nitric oxide (NO), superoxide, peroxynitrite, free radical formation and consequent oxidative stress. The activation of the VGCCs is thought to be produced via EMF impact on the VGCC voltage sensor, with the physical properties of that voltage sensor predicting that it is extraordinarily sensitive to these EMFs. It is shown here that the action of EMFs in terrestrial, multicellular (embryophyte) plants is probably similar to the action in animals in most but not all respects, with calcium channel activation in the plasma membrane leading to excessive \[Ca\]i, leading in turn to most if not all of the biological effects. A number of studies in plants are briefly reviewed which are consistent with and supportive of such a mechanism. Plant channels most plausibly to be involved, are the so-called two pore channels (TPCs), which have a voltage sensor similar to those found in the animal VGCCs.
<|endoftext|>This is James Corbett's report on 5G, really worth watching: 
<|endoftext|>This is because the threat is external. There is no looking into it. Any looking into things will lead to a dead end, only because the scope of their corruption is so grand... we're standing in it and tell it apart from our lives, fiction, and non.
<|endoftext|>Top disruptions of technology against animals includes destroying their habitats and killing them for food.Not sure why we need to get into conspiracies about the cause of harmful impact on animals. Pretty sure they rank 5g pretty low on the "please stop killing us" scale.
<|endoftext|>The millimetre band is huge, don't get alarmed. It starts at 30 ghz, ends at 300 ghz, and in cellular is used as backhauls. Point to point high speed links. They do not or should not be facing you, the customer. It's literally like wireless fibre, except fibre is better. And the power levels used are pretty low, highly directional, and have huge losses outside of the main beam. And by the way, that batman spy tech was already demonstrated using only wifi, years ago.
<|endoftext|>How does that work? 5G requires transmitters every 100m. Analogue TV stations were like one in every town, if you were lucky. How could they share the same frequency and have such different ranges?Not criticising your statement as I have no idea if it's true, just curious to learn more info.
<|endoftext|>5g uses those for some low band use only. 600 and 700 mhz. More of the 5g bands are higher frequency, like 2300, 3600, 3500 mhz.
<|endoftext|>No it doesn't. [ [
<|endoftext|>Yeah the "ionizing radiation" argument is so narrow and pointless, it's idiotic to think that it's the only metric that's relevant when discussing negative effects
<|endoftext|>If I may, in Canada at least, the RF guidelines are updated or at least reviewed every 5 years or so. &#x200B;The guidelines do not deal with ionizing radiation in any way, only thermal effects. Ionizing radiation is in the tetrahertz, whereas cellular is in the gigahertz. Orders of magnitude different. Basically,the guidelines are in place to prevent the only consistently repeatable hazard posed by RF, that of thermal heating. Like heat stroke. (This isn't to say it is the only effect, just the only consistently, repeatable effect, to be clear) .&#x200B;Radiowaves will not ionize anything, no if's and's or but's. Ionizing radiation starts at ultraviolet, and goes up to gamma rays. &#x200B;ELF is a different bird from the UHF of cellular communications. ELF is from 3 to 30 htz, with wavelengths 100000 to 10000 kilometres. UHF is 300 mhz to 30 ghz with wavelengths range from one meter to one tenth of a meter. &#x200B;Also, more ELF we are exposed to are from high voltage power lines, which doesn't really have much to do with cellular, though because they carry such high power, they can cause issues. It's not unheard of for high voltage lines to induce current in things near-by. Always park perpendicular to power lines, not parallel. Helps limit the current you will pick up.&#x200B;Comparing ELF to UHF is as useful as comparing cellular or TV broadcast radiation with ionizing radiation. It isn't that they are not in the same ball park, it's that they are totally different cities. High powered ELF's will go around the world, but high powered TV broadcasts only go so many miles.
<|endoftext|>If you would like a link to more papers about EMF, here is a link to way too many for me to peruse.&#x200B;[
<|endoftext|>I work in ML and have done taken some BCI classes as recently as a year and a half ago, that link is probably not as interesting as youd guess, also its ridiculously thick with marketing stuff.Neurogress is developing neurocontrol software which solves this limitation.This is achieved through incorporating artificial intelligence into the process ofinterpreting a brain signal and converting it into action. Machine learning is how almost everything EEG has been working for at least the past 5 years, here's a meta analysis of ML for EEG from 2015  EEG signals don't really mean anything on their own so of course you're going to need some kind of ML to map between signals and visible actions. As of a year and a half ago this paper was the SOTA for EEG  and the results aren't really that impressive to a layman. Basically subjects were asked to raise their index or middle finger, this could guess which one was raised roughly 90% of the time. Note that muscle movement sends a way stronger EEG signal than any kind of 'thought', like orders of magnitude larger, I can't recall any EEG (noninvasive) paper that has been able to do anything on thought alone. ECOG stuff is a bit more interesting but pretty rare. The SOTA for a while has been deep learning, and the fact that they don't mention deep learning anywhere (marketing teams almost always throw that in if they can) makes me think they're using more basic stuff. I also haven't seen many people run deep networks in real time on devices with less compute than a phone (and even on a phone it's challenging) so it makes sense that if they're running on a necklace sized device they'd be giving a lot up. If they did find a way to run real time deep networks on devices with less compute than a phone itd be a pretty big breakthrough. All that said just dont expect too much from eeg wearables in the next ~10 years.Blockchain will bring several benefits to the project. First, to enhance machinelearning algorithms with the help of users neural activity. I have absolutely no idea what this even means, I've got a rough understanding of blockchain and a pretty good understanding of most current ML algorithms but I can't think of how any one of them would be improved via blockchain. Maybe they're considering using blockchain as a way of transferring training data? I can't see what the benefit would be over any other kind of encryption. 90+% time I've seen ML+blockchain together it's been from some marketing team that thought they needed more buzzwords to throw on slides, so I'm guessing it's that. I feel like I'm getting carried away on this, but either way the Microsoft stuff sounds like a fitbit that throws in blockchain to capitalize on crypto hype. The fact that they don't even mention EEG in the patent makes me doubt it's an EEG device, I'd bet they just reference amazon's patent since they're both wearables that use blockchain.

<|endoftext|>Yeah, the reason it's all over media is because it's effing hilarious to watch people honestly think that 5G is causing issues like COVID. It's like Chemtrails 2.0. But please, keep believing in it. In fact, I fully support you. If you want to embarrass yourself for the world's entertainment, you have my backing. You'll be right alongside the Flat-Earthers (which I find funny that THAT is your limit - whoa, I'll believe 5G is bad, but man, those Flat-Earthers are dumb lol). But since we're in a conspiracy sub, I'll throw out my own theory. I think that the 5G conspiracy theory was created by Big Dish so that people out in the boonies continue to use Dish as opposed to getting with the times. MF'ers are so damn gullible. Faux News could tell them that Obama has sent bio-engineered crow-people to fuck up their crops and eat bees, and that's why crops are doing poorly, and next we'd have 4.2 mil posts about how COVID is perpetuated by CORVIDS, which in turn are because 5G, and F\*CK I lost where I was at....WE'VE GONE TO DEEP!Anyways, keep being you, thank you for the entertainment.
<|endoftext|>In theory yes, and it does help steelman arguments - but the consequence is a good chunk of properly researched info gets drowned out by people pushing more mainstream narratives.

<|endoftext|>I wonder if it occurs to anyone that throwing the rather large number of vaccines into only 2 categories, Pro- and Anti-, completely tramples over the need to independently evaluate the data and science for each vaccine! People would never accept such simplicity concerning other pharmaceuticals, yet they do for vaccines? They would laugh over characterizations of pro and anti steroids, or antibiotics or those crazy anti Tylenol folk lol... It's ludicrous how anyone would find such simplicity acceptable in literate, educated populations.
<|endoftext|>yeah its to stop the masses from finding any sense on this sub. Theyre the ones that needs this sub the most. Theres just no way that this many people would waste their time just downvoting and shit talking everything they see here..
<|endoftext|>I've been looking into this the past couple days, glad to see it was brought up. The black cube can have alot of meanings because of its simplicity, so can a cross. But unlike other symbols is the power that a black cube has over the mind.You see a black box in the middle of your room, whats your first thought? Whats inside. The mystery, its curiosity incarnate. This black cube is the symbol of mystery.
<|endoftext|>As far as I am concerned the cross is meant to signify the unraveling of the cube or the freedom from the prison of time.
<|endoftext|>Saturm = SatanCould you elaborate? I thought he was the sun of the morning star.Whats the symbol of christianity? The Cross? How does a cube become that.
<|endoftext|>I think the idea of the ether was more as a stationary reference for the whole universe that everything else was in reference to. For example the sun would have some velocity relative to the ether that would be it's true velocity. Then Einstein came along and said nah there's no true reference except the speed of light. Unless you're talking about something else, but when those scientists spoke of an ether, often they were referring to this.
<|endoftext|>Also yes, but I guess it is not the most common of experiences. But the visual aspect is certainly on the same spectrum, as I understand it. There is a pretty good representation of the effect in this scene in the film ["Enter the void"](
<|endoftext|>Thanks bro, I have been called much worse for similar opinion so thanks for at least not calling me an outright cunt.I just think that something like this OP should be open to discussion somewhere other than various conspiracy platforms I dont know 5G is deadly but at the same time I do not know its entirely safe either. Instead of being told its all fine and not even worth a debate makes me suspicious.

<|endoftext|>Doesnt take away from anything he said in the video though.You dont need a degree to be an expert. This fallacy is whats gotten us into our current situation, not questioning what some elite scholar says, because theyre an elite scholar, therefore they are not human, and do not have any human tendencies like self preservation, etc.
<|endoftext|>I disagree, this isn't like an esoteric drug trial where a chemical may respond differently to the neural or endocrine pathways between mice and humans. The research is done at a cellular level. Cellular damage is cellular damage, it doesn't matter if you're an amoeba or a dog or an ape, cellular damage is to be avoided.
<|endoftext|>More interestingly I wonder why people who don't have any decent response to a given argument or statement point at something wholly unrelated instead in a way that so obviously moves the goal posts that it looks like it might step from the metaphorical to the literal at any moment.

<|endoftext|>Okay a document of 180 scientists from 35 countries claiming that 5G rollouts should be halted until further research. I read the first person's testimonial, where he claims EMF Radiation from already implemented technologies has already been proven to be harmful. The end of this testimonial shows a citation for this claim, but at the end of the document there are no citations. Is this perhaps why it was deleted as a reference?

And that may discredit other arguments against 5G:So I think Martin is hurting the movement because he is so active and travels all over the world with his message. Many or even most activists currently believe in his calcium theory .In a longer review of 28 studies, Arthur Firstenberg in a blog post refutes that a single research reference supports the idea of activating voltage-controlled calcium channels.Arthur Firstenberg also believes that the mathematics of physical properties exclude the possibility of Palls alleged mechanism.Quite a huge scandal[source](

But the bands TV used are low, have good building penetration, good range, but lower throughput. &#x200B;They will be building many smaller cells for 5g, as 5g in the higher frequencies don't have the same range, as well as... smaller cells will be able to support more traffic, because they will not be servicing as many people.
<|endoftext|>Just my 2 cents. I believe they want to use blockchain with this to normalize the population to network attached implant devices. Nobody will want to be implanted and tracked if there's no incentive, and a blockchain could be a way to incentivize this patent so that more people are willing to accept it.We already have smart phones that listen with targeted ads and Internet of Thing appliances like refridgerators, dishwashers, thermostats, etc being on a network. They want to take us to the next step, which is the Internet of Humans. Think of all the personally identifiable information they can gather with a network attached implant device. Immunization records, criminal records, social credit, etc could all be linked to your implant device. This will permit the Five Eyes in the Sky to have complete information dominance.

Now We will make you turn towards a direction of prayer that will please you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque in Meccawherever you are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture certainly know this to be the truth from their Lord. And Allah is never unaware of what they do."We believe the Kaaba as it currently stands was built by Prophet Abraham and his son Prophet Ishmael, peace be upon them both.The Kaaba itself is just a [brick building]( The cloth that covers it, called kiswah, both protects it from the elements and beautifies it. The cloth has come in [many different colors]( over time, including white, red and green, and is currently black with verses of the Qur'an embroidered all over it in gold thread.Edit: Also, Muslims believe that Jesus, peace be upon him, is the Messiah who will return to Earth to defeat the False Messiah/Antichrist near the end of time. We also believe that Jesus, peace be upon him, was NOT crucified on a cross, but rather raised up to Heaven alive, and that when he returns, he will "[break the cross]( thus putting an end to the false claim the Christians make that he was crucified to death.

<|endoftext|>Yeah it's that but I think of it more as the medium that light travels in. Like how sound waves need an atmospheric medium, or ocean waves need a fluid medium... light/EM waves need an aether medium.It appears the press/media did use Einstein (and the Michelson-Morley experiment) to "shut down" aether theory, which leads me to "conspiracy" type thinking, especially because Einstein has been put on a pedestal as the go-to name for "genius" and guys like Tesla are rarely mentioned. Also, many prominent scientists at the time (Tesla, Bohr, Philipp Lenard) **heavily** disagreed with EinsteinAlso I read somewhere that Einstein's model doesn't directly *disprove* the aether, it just doesn't *require* it. However something is still missing from the equation...Einstein says that light bends around extremely massive bodies, but it is not because light is affected by gravity. He says this happens because mass warps space-time. Isn't this "space-time" the aether? Space-time is the medium that electromagnetic energy (like light) travels inAnd we still can't explain dark matter or dark energy, we just know "something else exists"
<|endoftext|>Interesting. The heavy hitters I know have reported seeing code instead of people's natural auras lately. Kinda creepy thinking they are scrambling our dna.
<|endoftext|>I strongly disagree with you (and mostly everyone) here but as long as you admit you don't know rather than spreading pseudoscience it's fine for me.General scientific consensus is that 5g is safe, I think the problem is many of these conspiracies that people see shared on Facebook, spread by family members etc are so ridiculous that they start to annoy people, and disproving them becomes a task of rebutting too many points with someone who is overly passionate about some unproven claims, where they fail to understand each branch of science they delve into while the person rebutting knows better but cannot be an expert in everything - hence the anger.Many 5g criticisms have outright misunderstood how it works, or what the supposed danger is that it gets tiring to debunk every single then someone spouts.

<|endoftext|>Ah, but when we're testing with EMF we're applying doses externally not internally. Skin thickness and overall body mass certainly come into play here.
<|endoftext|>Because hes wrong.. WiFi routers are 2.4GHz and some can do 5.GHzThe EMF that are true 5g are 6GHz -300GHz, also known as millimeter wave..Pretty sure Verizon is using 28GHz at the moment in certain cities.. it sucks so bad at penetrating walls, that when they tested it nba arenas only ppl in certain sections got a signal..Then you have 60GHz which seems to be gaining traction.. O2 completely absorbs 60GHz waves... so they cant travel through air very well yet they affect the oxygen we breathe..

Not a single limit has been imposed on electromagnetic exposure itself, and barely any research has been done on the magnetic fields of our own human bodies. We do know that the body has a magnetic field that extends several metres out form our bodies. Personally I think this is the scientific explanation for intuition - that very real energy fields are interacting with each other and our cells are aware but our conscious bodies are not... but that's another point of discussion.I recommend watching a documentary "Resonance: Beings of Frequency" to begin to get a picture of the research into this mostly being ignored by the Scientific community.

Plant a mast anywhere and you can transmit around the world, frequencies 535-1065 KHz (there's also a phenomenon called skywave involved where waves bounce off the ionosphere).5G works in much, much higher frequency area nowhere near UHF.

It's a thing that makes me unable to argue with deeply certain religious folk: Spiritual understanding is a moving target, truth is subjective. The concreteness of the physical world is a construct of our own minds, our minds are a construct of some metaphysical mystery. It's odd to say out loud, but isn't it possible this was the first day you woke up and your entire past is a construct, not actual?From that strange angle, our personal spiritual understanding is constantly evolving, not a static truth.But yeah, very cool cultural insight and very much similar to christians aggressively yelling "Christ is coming!"
<|endoftext|>thus putting an end to the false claim the Christians make that he was crucified to death. I would work on taking umbrage with the fact that your "prophet" Mohammed was a pedophile that married a nine year old girl and go from there.
<|endoftext|>Yeah no its a good observation of Saturn. Ive just heard other theories, such as the sun represents lucifer, etc, hence the sun worshippers.
<|endoftext|>I'm (just started) reading a book, "Einstein and the Ether"...so Einstein abandoned the concept of the Ether for about 20 years... but then took it up again, weirdly, despite himself (it emerged from his sub-conscious!). Since he never wrote any maths about it, it isn't talked about much. He said that, semantically, the meaning of a word has never changed as much as the meaning of the word "ether", and there were many competing meanings and theories of the Ether. His own later interpretation of it differs greatly from the earlier one that he dismissed. How? I don't know yet, just started reading...But one more interesting thing, it wasn't just light that they believed light need a medium to carry it, but perhaps more concerning to them, they could not comprehend gravity acting in a void and so the Ether came to be the medium that "carried" both light and gravity.
<|endoftext|>The michaelsen Morley experiment was designed to measure the ether (along with a number of other experiments) using light. It was Einstein who figured out a potential explanation for why they don't measure one. I'm not saying it doesn't exist but it's not easily experimentally verifiable
<|endoftext|>I was having some really weird vivid dreams last week that involved code and like modifying it and observing how it altered the universe or some shit. It was really abstract and it's hard to put my finger on it, but yeah lol
<|endoftext|>The dangers are real. Beamforming technology and microwaves have the potential to be very hard on the human body even if NOT in the hands of someone with ulterior motives. Ignoring any of the most realistic conspiracy theories, the way the human body responds to microwaves, regardless of frequency, is NEVER positive and at some frequencies it can literally kill you. Having a high band antenna pelt you with microwaves isnt something that doesnt deserve a reasonable amount of concern, and the studies that have been done on this are not pseudoscience.
<|endoftext|>The way I pulled off telepathy is this. Took about 3g-4g of shrooms, then smoked some weed about 30 min later as the effects kicked in which amplified it a bit. Then I closed my eyes and looked at the darkness examining all the different shades of black, looking for patterns, especially eyes because when you figure out the eyes, it's easy to make out the rest of the faces. Eventually you start seeing faces, in full color and in 3d and most remarkably, you notice that they appear to be alive and conscious! You can see it in their eyes. Millions of them, all shapeshifting and morphing in from of me, competing for my attention, then I learned how to get one of them and bring it up for conversation by focusing on one and not letting it go. What I found is that they use a visual language. basically, what you see responds to what you think as you look at it so there's a feedback loop. They can even play you a movie! You think a question and then the faces disappear and you see a scene play out answering your question, then the faces/entities return. The darkness becomes a multi-dimenssional, infinite resolution HD TV connected to the universal internet of life. truly a mind boggling experience.Here's a video I did many years back to try to show how to see them: [ information is always there, you just can't see normally because you don't know it's there or what to look for. Hidden in plain sight.And here's the best representation of the sea of faces that I managed to draw:[ is a good guide from Terence Mckenna:Part1: [ [ [ [ is mastery of thinking.I should probably make a video describing my experiences, just a bit too shy lol
<|endoftext|>Yeah, but the flaw in your logic is putting medical professors on a pedestal to begin with. Assuming any or every doctor isnt a person with issues in their past, criminal charges, etc etceveryone has some dirt to be dug up. All that matters is whether or not someone has truth to what they are saying...thats the only bottom line.

<|endoftext|>DNA damage due to overheating of tissue (breaking of ionic bonds, hence "ion-ising radiation").DNA is held together by covalent and hydrogen bonds, not ionic bonds. Ionizing radiation is electromagnetic waves that have enough energy to knock electrons off atoms.Not a single limit has been imposed on electromagnetic exposure itselfIt has though. Ionizing radiation is electromagnetic radiation.barely any research has been done on the magnetic fields of our own human bodiesIt has and it hasn't. I think the problem is that we can't really test humans without breaching ethical codes. We have been studying people as they live with the radiation around them...
<|endoftext|>**NO** Whales can not and do not communicate with radio waves. It is a simple thing, radio waves are a type of light, in fact light is a radio wave, and light is absorbed by water easily (sound isn't) so this is impossible.

<|endoftext|>You know aspirin is just white willow bark right? And antibiotics were initially fungal cultures? I don't get the hating on homeopathy. I used to work for a herbal company and saw arthritic dogs run again, PSA scores drop, insomniacs find restful sleep again. There's nothing magical about plants' healing properties, they have very well-established pathways in which they act on our chemical and neurological systems.Meanwhile that Ibuprofen you take is doing just a little irreversible damage to your organs every time you take it. Benadryl is doing the same to your brain. Xanax also likely causes dementia and suppresses immune function. Commonly prescribed antibiotics do permanent heart damage, see erithromycin/cipro. It's the pharmaceutical companies who are the real criminals.
<|endoftext|>I recently caved in and got one for GPS. But it has no sim card. If I have to make a call I turn the wifi radio on my router and use a VOIP connection. Pretty easy.
<|endoftext|>No, not exactly. The 5G bands taht are using old TV spectrum are lower bands. 700 mhz and 600 mhz. 600 is a new addition with 5G, but more bands have been added to the higher end, then the lower end. 4g - 700, 850, 1900, 2100, 2600 (all in mhz)5g - 600, 700, 850, 1900, 2100, 2300, 2500, 2600, 3500 (all in mhz)From wikipediaThe Pan-American television frequencies are different for terrestrial and cable television systems. Terrestrial television channels are divided into two bands: the VHF band which comprises channels 2 through 13 and occupies frequencies between 54 through 216 MHz, and the UHF band, which comprises channels 14 through 51 and occupies frequencies between 470 and 700 MHz. These bands are different enough in frequency that they often require separate antennas to receive (although many antennas cover both VHF and UHF), and separate tuning controls on the television set. The VHF band is further divided into two frequency ranges: VHF low band (Band I) between 54 and 88 MHz, containing channels 2 through 6, and VHF high band (Band III) between 174 and 216 MHz, containing channels 7 through 13. The wide spacing between these frequency bands is responsible for the complicated design of rooftop TV antennas. The UHF band has higher noise and greater attenuation, so higher gain antennas are often required for UHF. 460mhz - 700 mhz was freed up by the switch to digital TV broadcasts. They are good in that they have greater ranger and greater ability to penetrate buildings then higher frequency signals, but do not have the same throughput as higher bands.
<|endoftext|>You did such a great job of elaborating on your point. Care to make one, or just continue with what your comment history shows is just a long line of snarky low-effort comments? Do you really feel what I've said is untrue? You dont think social media is massively manipulated by different groups? Because it's very hard to argue against that being the case so I'd love to hear it.
<|endoftext|>Number 1. Quick search around shows it's 23.4 degrees and 67000miles. Fudging the numbers to suit. Close but no donut. 2. Only a small fraction of Australia and North America can see it at the same time and only for a brief moment. This is because they are just inside 50% of the Earth's circumference and the moon is high enough/far enough away to be in sight of both. For one it's low in the east, the other it's low in the west. 3. That will be to do with the airlines and their business models. Some airlines go straight to Mexico, but clearly for Australia is more efficient to go to us and then passengers exchange from there. There are flights from New Zealand direct to Mexico, NZ is right by Australia. By your reasoning why don't those ones go to US first? It's like asking why buses don't go straight to where I want and I have to exchange over long distances. They go where it's efficient.4.That involves alot of maths. But the short version is, elevation, even just to your eyes, changes the maths as to what flat earthers calculate they should see. And then on top of that you have refraction caused by the air temperature over the lake which causes light to bend. Even then you are only see what is elevated at Chicago. The bottom of it is still below the horizon. 5. Because that statement itself is untrue. Only poeple very north or very south can see the same stars. For the rest they move. 6. Because it picks up more light and detail than your eyes can. To your eyes it's reached what is called the vanishing point, but is not yet over the horizon. If you keep watching with the zoom or binoculars, it will eventually drop below the actual horizon as expected.

<|endoftext|>Also, its easy to "show" corona infection through "testing"... The inventer of PCR apparently says its bullshit to find proof of infection. Hence the current "numbers". Great point though. What if Corona is the way to introduce this type of "infection". Supposedly it will last a long time..those who vax "wont get it", ie: the obedient population. Those who dont get vaxd will be susceptible to "infection". Again...theory..but..here we are.
<|endoftext|>Who knows better what I worship? Me, or you? revere - feel deep respect or admiration for (something)worship - show reverence and adoration for (a deity)Worship is an act of religious devotion directed towards a deity. The Kaaba is a building constructed as a place for worshipping [THE Deity]( While Muslims consider the Kaaba to be a sacred place that we deeply respect, our worship is directed toward the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth and all that is within it.To say that we are worshipping a mere rock, a creation of our Creator, is absurd, and stems from absolute ignorance regarding what Islam actually is."[Tawheed]( (Arabic:  tawd, meaning 'unification or oneness of God') is the indivisible oneness concept of monotheism in Islam. Tawheed is the religion's central and single most important concept, upon which a Muslim's entire faith rests. It unequivocally holds that God is One (Al-Aad) and Single (Al-Wid)."Tawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of faith. The first part of the shahada (the Islamic declaration of faith) is the declaration of belief in the oneness of God. To attribute divinity to anything or anyone else, is shirk  an unpardonable sin according to the Qur'an, if repentance is not sought afterwards. Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawheed."
<|endoftext|>"[...] truth is subjective.""***The truth is from your Lord***, so never be among the doubters."[The Qur'an, chapter 2, verse 213]( was [of] one religion [before their deviation]; then Allah sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners and sent down with them the Scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed. And none differed over the Scripture except those who were given it - after the clear proofs came to them - out of jealous animosity among themselves. And ***Allah guided those who believed to the truth concerning that over which they had differed, by His permission. And Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.***"[The Qur'an, chapter 2, verse 147]( - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence."He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel."Before, as guidance for the people. And He revealed the Qur'an. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution."Indeed, from Allah nothing is hidden in the earth nor in the heaven."It is He who forms you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. ***As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them].

The concept of objective truth and mankind's tendency to deviate from it because of their own desires is much-discussed in al-Qur'an ("the Recitation"). I would encourage everyone to give the entire thing a read. Anyone who truly considers themselves a truthseeker will find themselves pausing and reflecting and truly feeling humbled by the gems of knowledge found in this text. I was an Agnostic Atheist for about a decade before I read it, and once I did, I found that I absolutely could not ignore the obvious truthfulness of it. It informed me of the truth I had often sought, but had also at times despaired might not exist. For every existential question I ever posed, I discovered a clear-cut answer in the Qur'an. It would certainly not hurt one in the slightest to see what it says in full, in context, and to decide how one feels and thinks about it afterwards.[The Clear Qur'an]( is a, well, very clear and simple translation.The first one I ever read was the [Oxford World's Classics]( translation.The more ya know!
<|endoftext|>Why are you trying to attack OP? They were explaining their faith and did so in very eloquent way. No where did they say or even imply that if you're Christian, you should not believe Jesus was crucified - you have every right to believe that, or the opposite, or neither.
<|endoftext|>Pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.Aside from Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, all of the other women the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, married in his lifetime were either widows and divorced women. He was not exclusively or primarily attracted to women of any particular age.Also, Aisha was not a "prepubescent child", but rather a post-pubescent woman who consented to marriage. After menstruation has begun and pubic hair has begun to grow, a female is no longer a child. That is the crystal clear sign that a female has transitioned from childhood to adulthood.Had Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, expressed that she was not yet interested in getting married, no marriage would have taken place. But she agreed to the marriage, and spent the rest of her life after the death of her husband, the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, narrating to others the religious wisdom she had learned from him during their marriage.
<|endoftext|>Microwaves don't have enough energy to harm you outside of extremely high-intensity, and perhaps long-term sustained exposure to it, but the latter is not conclusive.Even then it ignores how most microwaves are actually deployed and used in practice. Microwaves are also non-ionising, that is it doesn't penetrate deep into tissues.A lower power transmissions such as cell towers, or something like 5g which can only travel short distances, hence the reason the roll-out is expensive as they need to lay more towers compared to something like 4g.

Ionizing radiation is electromagnetic waves that have enough energy to knock electrons off atoms.Thank you, I am still learning. I have gone back and corrected that.It has though. Ionizing radiation is electromagnetic radiation.Incorrect. Electromagnetic fields are not ionising radiation. Both occur as a consequence of waves being broadcast, but if you have looked at this in depth, you would know that EMF is generated by even electronic devices such as TVs and Computers. Here is a study that talks about it; it has been known for a long time that this is a health risk: [ you look, it references people working in front of CRT monitors for long periods of time, which obviously aren't transmitting wireless frequencies - but they are emitting electromagnetic fields. They are definitely not the same thing.FWIW I have personal experience of this, so despite what my earlier mistake about ionising radiation may suggest, I have definitely researched a lot into this, because I have personally felt the affects - and before I knew anything about it or knew what EMF sensitivity was.
<|endoftext|>NO literature on the effect of radio waves on whales then. Damn that sounded interesting. . .What if animals had extrasensory perception into light?

<|endoftext|>FYI homeopathy is NOT the same as herbalism, holistic medicine, TCM, Ayurveda, or complementary medicine.In case you are curious, Homeopathy is based on the principles of The Law of Similars and Law of Infinitesimals, where they dilute tiny amounts of a substance that would be toxic in large doses to allegedly jumpstart the body to cure the illness. Where as, Holistic Medicine is essentially a philosophy of treating the whole person (mind, body, spirit). Herbalism is how people have been treating illness for thousands of years, using plants and herbs for treatment. And Complementary Medicine is using Holistic, Herbal, or Alternative Medicines in conjunction with Conventional Modern Medicine.
<|endoftext|>/u/clemaneuverers, can you even confirm for certain that those towers are for 5G? As a person taking training in IT, I find it quite unusual that *two* 5G towers are located what seems like ten meters away from one another. And in trees? Like, the fuck?Additionally, unless the individual who shot this video collected the bee corpses and sent them into a lab for autopsy, it is impossible to know for sure the cause of their deaths. To quote the top comment below the video, "if there were resident colonies of bees on either of those towers or enclosures, the number of bees you're showing on the ground would be completely normal."I'm not saying that you're 100% wrong, just that this evidence is not strong enough for me to accept as scientifically meaningful. If you happen to have a paper on the effects of 5G RFs on bees from a credible source, I would love to read it.

<|endoftext|>While you are correct, it is typically a good idea to trust certain individuals who concur with each other to find answers. However, the truth in many cases, are what they are paid to come up with. Proof enough of this is in how scientific research is funded. The cold, harsh reality (nowadays especially) is that when subjected to the possibility of having funding revoked because your experiments proved whatever agenda the funder had, wrong, many times experiments will be custom tailored for a specific result. Scientists are often funded by lobbyists, or companies with conflicting interests in whatever field they are funding. Sadly science is just as corrupt as anything else lobby money and government money touches.Btwits good having a grounded discussion on not only reddit, but on this sub specifically. Its either an echo chamber, or when theres a disagreement, theres mud-slinging and name calling.

<|endoftext|>Ionizing radiation is either purely electromagnetic waves of a specific wavelength or neutrons freed from an atom's nucleus (which can be mathematically described as a propagating wave).I suggest you look up how we first learned that moving charges (electricity) yields a magnetic field and how moving magnets yields an electrical field.They are intrinsically inseparable...So when you say:Electromagnetic fields are not ionising radiationYou are simply showing everyone how little you understand.The only conspiracy here is the amount of misunderstanding people have about light.
<|endoftext|>Seeing infrared isn't too hard-the frequency of IF Waves is only a bit lower than Visible light, and visible light is based on us human eyes, so if we used visible light based on animals like dogs, we can see infrared too. Extrasensory perception of light is just an eye with extra steps.It probably will make sense for them to talk using light waves, the problem is that, light doesn't travel too good in water- you'll see you've ever been in a pool with led at the bottom. Producing IF is easy too, it is used in heat signatures and hunting, but talking on it will require things like Morse code. Imagine if you have to understand a sentence in which someone else uses a bulb.
<|endoftext|>But as I'm sure you know, 4G tech isn't remotely close to 5G. 5G is killing bees in mass. This should be concerning to you if you care about humanity and life on this planet. If you don't... the it's not.Here's a really, really good half hour video about the scientific fact that 5G technology is killing bees, which is a terrible indicator: "5G" encompasses a broad range of frequencies. Only some of the higher ones may be dangerous. This is a complex subject, but a very important one.

<|endoftext|>Look, originally you asked why they are on the internet if it is harmful. I provided an example of how I and others access the internet in fairly safe way. Then you moved the goal post to saying that we're economically supporting 5g by subscribing to an ISP, using Google etc. That is besides the original point (safe internet access). This is a tu quoque fallacy because my and other's behavior does not refute the truth of how to access the internet safely. It doesn't make us hypocrites either
<|endoftext|>The thing is, we know full well that bees use magnetism for navigation. To me it's pretty obvious that sending high powered electromagnetic waves through the air is going to be a pretty bad move.I recommend reading [this]( \- essentially it says there are biological effects on many forms of wildlife, but the studies are so poor that they cannot give definitive conclusions.I cite this because it's the largest meta-study of it's kind, funded by the EU, and even they couldn't find people who had actually bothered to study if electromagnetism was harming wildlife. That should be a pretty big red flag in itself. The burden of proof needs to be on the makers of the technology to prove it is safe BEFORE it is approved - and what we are finding is poorly done studies are being done AFTER the fact, many of which are showing effects but with most of the funding for studies coming form the telecoms industry itself, and a lot of money riding on the next wave of tech being introduced, the issue is deliberately being obfuscated.

<|endoftext|>I'm in the industry. It's all too common to see two towers very close nearby. If it's prime real estate, everyone wants to be on it, and the primest real estate in towers is height. And everyone want their gear at the top, not their competitors.&#x200B;Where I live, ordinances have been passed mandating tower sharing, but the cell companies often don't get along.&#x200B;There are many towers where I am at, with old, dead antenna taking up space. Their only purpose is to literally take up space, and deny it legally to their competitors.
<|endoftext|>Those are 4G towers, not true 5G. Go through the comments by tech workers in that video. The bees-dying thing is a known phenomenon.
<|endoftext|>True 5G, what Verizon is installing everywhere is 28GHz and 39GHz.. straight off there website.. those signals suck and they have to put access points everywhere.. they have the ability to mesh them somehow and increase range but its still pretty bad.. so to compliment it, Verizon has 5g technology running on 700MHz and otherblower frequencies because their range is way better...Look up Verizon and their roll out of true 5g into NBA stadiums.. a few access points band still onlyCertain sections got true 5g...And kinda odd some of the first corona virus patients were nBA players
<|endoftext|>I was being sarcastic, but in all fairness why are companies putting billions in a system that is abhorrently obsolete compared to 4g?I have gotten up to 193mbps Download near a mall in NJ, I have no application in the world that can possibly need more than that. It was on Verizon. Most of the time I get 90-140 but the point is, it's capable of at least 190+ which is more than anyone can use. I have tested it to get a 4g signal all the way out to 5 miles off of the Key West islands. I was far enough I couldn't even make out buildings on the shoreline but was still able to ping Google.com over strictly 4g frequency. Again, Verizon on an LG v30 (older) phoneNow compare that to 5g which can't even get past a tree or some concrete and can only work monodirectionally and requires an antenna pointed in each direction arguably costing more just for the hardware alone!What. The. Fuck. Is. The. Reason. For. This. Investment. No one has the answer.
<|endoftext|>I wouldn't say misleading, or intentionally misleading. There is a good chance that what was written was as true as they understood things.

It's a very sophisticated system, with various groups competing to control narratives online. Some more obvious than others. So IMO, ESPECIALLY in a contentious sub like this, it's important to be aware that these forces are out there, and that there's a good chance you've come across at least one of them a day - likely far more. Perhaps not folks you chat with directly (although likely), but also in the comments you see, in what gets upvoted to the top, etc. I've done work on the fringes of this indutry - it's a very real, very co-ordinated, and very well-funded industry. It doesn't take much looking to find that you can literally pay people to promote content, buy unique upvotes on Reddit, etc etc. People with money and power are absolutely doing this on a large scale.
<|endoftext|> that video.If you have further questions come back and discuss.Also you cant say things like "Just no, refraction would cause the image to flip" without providing evidence or examples of phenomena.Edit:Also there is more empirical truth to flat earth being a psy op to discredit the truth movement than there is empirical evidence of the earth being flat.
<|endoftext|>By saying "I would take umbrage with the fact that...", you were clearly disregarding everything OP had said. You personally can take offence, dislike etc any religion, but why reply something to do with pedophilia on a comment that was so informative, eloquent and neutral? Clearly the motivation is to discredit OP. The child The Prophet married was no younger than was the norm in those days - ALL across the middle east and the globe. You cannot divorce the matter from its historical context.
<|endoftext|>What's different about theirs than Christianity? How many times have we heard of a priest or 'youth pastor' doing naughty things with kids.It's fairly certain that Gandhi practiced some sort of weird sexual yoga with underage participating. So I think you're pretty much left with like what, Buddhism?The search for God's true messenger to man sure seems to bring them out doesn't it?
<|endoftext|>Well Christianity is run by pedophile's today, and for the past hundreds of years. Not really a high-ground situation here...
<|endoftext|>They were married when she was 9, but the marriage was consummated when she was 12. So actually it was a marriage between a 56-year-old and a 12-year-old.To be clear, all that you are actually doing is criticizing who Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, decided to marry and at what age she decided to marry, and you are trying to enforce your own belief/opinion/preference on all other people.Do what you want for yourself, and let other consenting post-pubescents do what they want. Think you can handle that?Edit: Also...you seem really into "Teen Mom". Lololololol.
<|endoftext|>You mean this one?[Verizon- what frequency is 5g]( where in that does it say what you just said....In fact it says 4g is 600mhz to 2.5ghz...
<|endoftext|>Yeah, water is near blackbody and lower frequencies are absorbed immediately, only higher energy wavelengths travel at all... radio is impractical underwater (sonar wins!)And yeah I visualize radio tower and wifi signals as simple blinking lights, just like morse code
<|endoftext|>5G is killing bees in mass.There is 0 solid evidence of this, as far i have seen, nor has this video changed anything in this regard. I'll expand on this point in a second.Here's a really, really good half hour video about the scientific fact that 5G technology is killing bees.If I were looking for reputable source on this topic, it would not be these two. Mr Shirt seems to think that 5G radiation is "a hundred times more powerful" than 4G (it isn't), and she compared a 5G antenna to being one step down from a ADS weapon (which is wrong on multiple levels and just proves her understanding of physics or tech isn't up to the job).The second reason these guys are misrepresenting the science is because they focus on the attention grabbing, clickbaity headlines instead of reading the actual scientific studies. (there is a huge problem with science reporting in the mainstream press, which is why you should always read the studies themselves rather than rely on a unqualified journalist or activist to tell you what's in them.)Case in point:*Source #2 headline:* **Its Official  Cell Phones are Killing Bees** *What the article actually says*: "Cell phones **may** be causing bees to become **lost and disoriented.**" (paraphrasing) Nowhere does it say the bees are harmed, let alone killed. It implies that it **could** be causing them to die indirectly (from confusion? It's not clear). **All three of the sources they refer to do exactly the same thing - in not a single one is there any evidence which proves that 5G kills bees!**[Here's a review of the famous 2011 bee study written by an actual scientist]( which clearly explains why the findings about the effects on bees so far are 1) not at all catastrophic and 2) not even proven scientifically.In summary, I'm all for protecting the environment and would like to see further studies done to ensure we are not inadvertently harming wildlife. **However**, we shouldn't be making strong claims about effects that are not supported by the actual research.
<|endoftext|>Sidenote: A class of pesticides made by Bayer were the cause of the disappearing bees in crops/orchards.
<|endoftext|>Just watched the video. Can't attest they are 5g, but there isn't much difference between 4gLTE and 1st gen 5g sites. By eye and by tech, they are broadly similar.
<|endoftext|>Not THAT close. This shit ain't Bluetooth, dude. It's 5G. They're planning on using satellites for this stuff. If they can't have two 5G towers 100 meters apart communicate, then there's no use looking for a conspiracy because Big Tech won't be able to roll 5G out nationwide anyways. How is 5G supposed to be beamed across large distances and compensate for both atmospheric interference and the fact that it operates on an inverse square law if it can't communicate in small, local areas?My theory is that one of those is a 5G tower, and the other is 4G or some other "legacy" tower.
<|endoftext|>The first part of your comment was entirely reasonable, and I thank you for it.The last sentence, however, is pure idiocy, for multiple reasons. 1. Coronavirus is a virus. It's literally a virus. You cannot get a viral infection from radiation. Period.2. The first coronavirus patients were citizens of Wuhan, not NBA players. The first American coronavirus patients were...also not NBA players. Rudy Gobert was the first NBA player to test positive for the virus, [on March 12]( The first US case was [detected on January 15th or so, nearly two months (57 days) before Gobert got it.]( for the 28GHz part...as I said in another comment, "If they can't have two 5G towers 100 meters apart communicate, then there's no use looking for a conspiracy because Big Tech won't be able to roll 5G out nationwide anyways."Additionally, I still can't accept the notion that radio waves, even if high frequency, can cause harm to biological entities without some form of scientific paper on the subject. If you happen to have one of those, I'd love to read it. :)
<|endoftext|>Yes I know. So how does someone doing that invalidate whatever Science is behind it? You can say it is a foolish thing to do, in a video about wireless tech killing bees, but that has literally ZERO correlation as to whether it is actually true or not. For that you must read the scientific literature.
<|endoftext|>It just so happens I work for Verizon. As far as the technical limitations of the 5G network, they have plans to not only put 5G repeaters on towers, but also on commercial buildings, and maybe even residential buildings. That would solve most of the issues with coverage. 4G wont just be turned off when 5G is rolled out. 4G will supplement our network, much like how our current 3G networks do. So when you arent receiving 1000+ MBPS youll still be getting 4G speeds. The reason for upgrading our network to over 10x the speed is AI, more than to download a movie to your phone in 2 seconds. Autonomous driving will improve, augmented reality systems will evolve and become more relevant, and your IOT at home will be much more than turning on lights and locking your doors for you. Your Siri and Google assistants will evolve into more contextually aware programs that will be able to understand you way better than current assistants. This technology will also inevitably be used for surveillance of people. Facial and body recognition software will be paired with government entities to identify threats. We should be more worried about these types of things because they will only lead to the world becoming more and more like China.
<|endoftext|>Why put cameras on all smartphone? Why put cameras on every computer ? If something doesn't make sense then it means that there is another purpose to it. Did you see that "zeusone" (the guy you replied to) just happen to work for verizon. Isn't that a potential conflict of interest? How can we trust anything he says? Anyway he is full of shit, there has been no studies that can conclusevely say that 5G is harmless AND there are studies that showed potential threat. The fact that Google is censoring this topic should be a RED FLAG. If something doesn't make sense to you, don't worry it sure makes sense to other people.
<|endoftext|>there actually are direct flights from oceania to south america, for example Air New Zealands auckland-buenos aires
<|endoftext|>Lol the amount of people living in SA and Australia would more than sufficient to have flight. Yet conclusion based on nothing but an assumption.All the european backpackers in these area would be enough to have flights.
<|endoftext|>You linked to home depot shit? Why? Im on my Phone, The work to provide sources is simply too much for the extend to how much I care about this conversation, but id gladly discuss it still and encourage you to look up these things yourself Within the movement many are trying to make it seem ridiculus, making disc earthers appear very dumb intentionally and then showing that to the masses. To me, people infiltrating the movement and making it seem like that only more support its real. They have lied to us about everything. Everything. All big scientists of our time are either Zionists or Freemasons - besides Tesla, which is why he is not mentioned much to the public. Especially before the Tesla cars.To quote Tesla:Earth is a realm, it is not a planet. It is not an object, therefore,it has no edge. Earth would be more easily defined as a systemenvironment. Earth is also a machine, it is a Tesla coil. The sun andmoon are powered wirelessly with the electromagnetic field (theAether). This field also suspends the celestial spheres withelecto-magnetic levitation. Electromag levitation disproves gravitybecause the only force you need to counter is the electromagneticforce, not gravity. The stars are attached to the FIRMAMENT.
<|endoftext|>Idobt care enough to do that. If you dont learn that only you can teach yourself you will stay a sheep all your life.
<|endoftext|>That is disgusting, I can no longer engage with you and won't. Next time don't use your alt, it's cowardice.I will always point this out; so no one is deceived by a religion created by a pedophile terrorist.
<|endoftext|>How many times have we heard of a priest or 'youth pastor' doing naughty things with kids.Huge difference as Christ never touched a small child. What random perverts choose to do with their own time is completely different than following a man who married a 9 year old child.
<|endoftext|>she was 9, but the marriage was consummated when she was 12. So actually it was a marriage between a 56-year-old and a 12-year-old. Sure she was. Nice mental gymnastics to justify your "prophet's" taste in little girls. And as to your edit my taste in trashy reality TV is far less laughable than serving a pedo prophet.Anyhoo this conversation is over as I take nothing you say seriously. And refrain from sending me anymore trash via chat. Thank you.
<|endoftext|>Wifi is much more complicated than that, it has 2 waves added (literally added) over each other to form a new wave called **Modulated wave**. 1 of the waves helps in travelling (which is simple and known perfectly; called as *carrier wave*. It has low frequency) and the second one holds data. Knowing the *carrier wave* (which is standard), data can be found by subtracting it from the **Modulated wave**
<|endoftext|>Man, most of this sub has no capacity for reason or logic/u/ILikeCharmanderOk and some downvoters are in here unable to comprehend that "medicinal plants" and "homeopathy" are not the same thingHomeopathy is where you take something and dilute it with water to the point where there's either one or zero molecules of it left, then have someone drink the glass of water. The only reason it ever works is because of the placebo effect.
<|endoftext|>Cautious. I don't believe WiFi is necessarily bad for you. But it might be, I have no need for it, am perfectly happy on more reliable wired connections. It's clear you've been indoctrinated by the unquestioning subservience of r/science and the like. Besides, how does what I do in my home bother you? I was asked what I do and I explained. How nosey and arrogant are you? I think we're done here - blocked.
<|endoftext|> hope the cross post is allowed.
<|endoftext|>Monsanto is deeply flawed.But also, just because the bees disappear doesn't mean that they no longer exist. There could surely be insect populations who have migrated or hidden in places we aren't currently surveying.It's incredibly arrogant and somewhat disingenuous to take 1600 square miles of data and extrapolate it to the other 196,894,000 square miles.*I looked in a single square inch of my house and didn't find my shoes, so my shoes must not be in my house.*
<|endoftext|>The problem is that anecdotal evidence like the video above is entirely meaningless if it can't convince the wider populace, much less a court of law, that 5G is a threat.In another comment, I suggested something along the lines of what you said just now, which is that one of those towers is 5G while the other is 4G. Now, I didn't even know what you just told me, about how some towers are left occupied but unused, and that adds an entirely new layer of doubt onto this.Thanks for sharing your expertise.
<|endoftext|>Dana Ashlie, a scientist and conspiracy researcher, lays out evidence that 60 megahertz technology in particular can be very damaging and can block the absorption of oxygen. 
<|endoftext|>Ok. I was just pointing out some interesting things. I agree it's a virus. As for the 28GHz part...as I said in another comment, "If they can't have two 5G towers 100 meters apart communicate, then there's no use looking for a conspiracy because Big Tech won't be able to roll 5G out nationwide anyways.They can.. That's exactly what they are doing. They mesh them in a grid and increase the output. And they also have a 4G tower built in for the long range people. They are rolling it out everywhere, this is the new technology. Yeah it wont be in the rural areas, but mid to major cities to mega cities. Yes it will eventually be there.I am not going to do the research for you, higher frequency all the time isnt good. The military has a weapon that operates at 90GHz used to disperse crowds.At 60GHz, the wave is completely absorbed by oxygen, that cant be good.Basically, it exacerbate the electrons and causes "Heat." That's it. We'll see, in the meantime, I'll look for some credible sources about mmWave. It's not good, I've read a few articles on it. Specifically the one on Wired, about 2 years back.. Wired made him retract the article, and someone else wrote a pro 5g article.Just look up 60Ghz, mmWave and you will see articles on it. I know they arent studies. But there currently are ZERO studies saying it's safe.
<|endoftext|>I'm an unaffiliated skeptic who has done quite a bit of reading on this subject, and so far there are only hints that cellular radiation (2G - 5G) could be harmful,and they're far from conclusive.
<|endoftext|>there are direct flights from south america to oceania dude, check auckland-buenos aires air new zealands flight
<|endoftext|>The only part that was said by Tesla is the last paragraph:Though free to think and act, we are held together like the stars in the firmament, with ties inseparable. These ties cannot be seen, but we can feel them, each of us is only part of a whole.Some unscrupulous flat-Earthers even simplified the paragraph, and then it got passed on as:The stars are attached to the firmament.The original quote by Tesla is from his article The Problem of Increasing Human Energy with Special References to the Harnessing of the Suns Energy, published by Century Magazine, June 1900.It was only a figure of speech, emphasizing human togetherness in the energy problem. And obviously, it doesnt refer to the figure of the Earth, or its motion.In the same article, Tesla even mentioned the word globe no less than 12:The "movement" you're referring to was started by COINTEL Pro.
<|endoftext|>Haha, you are trolling right? What would be the benefit of telling people the earth is round? All planets I. The solar system are a sphere.if the earth was flat then you should be able to see across the ocean, but its round and you cant. Explain how you have day and night..,
<|endoftext|>By this logic you have to go out and do all your own research and you can't use anybody else research to prove anything.
<|endoftext|>It is not the 'norm' in Islam. In fact, it can be hard to actually classify 'norms' in such a widely practiced religion as society contexts will affect religious practice.The Qur'an does explicitly say wives are to be "of age" and that women have the right to choose their own husbands. The "of age" bit is obviously the matter of contention as that's specific to times and places.Nonetheless, my main point was that Mirandasrevenge's comment was a really questionable one given OP's original comment, which I think we can all agree on.
<|endoftext|>I'm an American now living in Egypt, which is a Muslim-majority country, and the age of consent here is 18. The norm here for *most people* is that men and women start getting married after graduating college, and from what I've seen amongst all of my husband's family and friends, people here often get married to someone they met while they were in college, or someone they met in their first job straight out of college. This isn't really how things should be working in Islam, but it's what has become common these days. Because in Islam a man is obligated to provide his wife with shelter and all of her food and clothing, it often takes middle-class guys years to save up enough money to buy an apartment, unless their dad has enough money to pay for it for them. Because of this, you'll often see that a man gets engaged to a woman he met in college, and they remain engaged for years until he can buy the apartment.My husband has friends who are almost 30, have been engaged for several years to a woman around their age, and who are working themselves to the bone trying to save up enough to buy a place to live so they can finally get married. It's so sad that the economy and the materialistic demands of women (who really crave living a Western lifestyle) are making men in this country reach the age of 30 still unmarried virgins who are literally already going bald from work-related stress!A minority of people here do get married in their teens (and the government has been known to [crack down]( on those marriages if they catch wind of them happening), and those people who do so are typically poor people living in villages who have never and will never receive any kind of formal education, so they basically have no reason to wait until their mid-20s or 30s to get married; they're not occupied with exams, trying to get promoted at their office jobs, stacking cash for honeymoons to Bali or Cyprus or nice apartments and cars, etc. So when poor people in rural villages reach puberty, they typically just go ahead and try to get married, especially since, in Islam and Christianity, a person can only have a sexual relationship with someone they're married to, and who wants to wait until they're in their 20s or 30s to finally fulfill their sexual desires???
<|endoftext|>Except when the current powerholders of a religion are largely pedos, that's not exactly better than what was rather commonplace at the time. How any Christian can disparage Islam on the basis of historical child abuse boggles my mind - impressive mental gymanstics!
<|endoftext|>Ok I see the confusion. That doesn't go into much detail. Try other articles. However it does say this..."5Gs spectrum in-part includes the radio frequencies of28 and 39 GHz: they are higher frequencies than the bands below 6 GHz that were used in 4G and earlier generations of cellular."And then further down it's says "5G MAY also utilize ultra-high frequency radio waves between 300 MHz and 3 GHz."Note the "may also". As in it can also use lower ranges. Because those are 4g ranges. However if you look at the articles explaining it properly, you'll see it's full range. Such as this one, from the same poeple. 
<|endoftext|>oh shit its phase angle is adjusted?edit: nvm im reading it now... its more like frequency modulation, but yeah I wouldn't expect animals to do this with their organsMaybe I can still reduce this to a blinking light in my mind? Haha
<|endoftext|>That's a good article. Pretty much sums up why we have so much speculation and wild theorycrafting going on - more tests need to be done to assuage people's fears about possible effects.However, this is a telling paragraph, imo:Many critics of the dominant EMF research bodies and its historical ties to industry compare the situation with the way tobacco manufacturers were able to maintain doubt about whether smoking was dangerous. **I dont like that comparison, because there, the harmful effects are clear, whereas with EMF we are still guessing how big or small the problem is**, says Louis Slesin.Now I'm no scientific expert, but it does seem to me that, given how significantly cellular technology has become part of our daily lives over the last few decades, we should be able to see clear evidence of adverse effects by now. Seeing as we don't, perhaps that suggests that if they do exist at all then they are relatively minor.
<|endoftext|>Lol you're interrupting their Science Good, Modern Human Good circlejerk. Dunno why they insist on throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Well, I suspect big pharma indoctrination has a lot to do with it. God forbid people smoke or eat cannabis for pain, or drink garlic tea for infection as Greek soldiers did after battle. I'm not against a good antibiotic when necessary but a lot of those are bad for the heart, docs won't usually even bother to tell you. Erithromycin, Cipro, that shit does damage. Nature has remedies aplenty, not as strong or effective usually, but also vastly lower on the body load side of things. And sometimes modern medicine has no solution, like with Covid. It's a shame docs aren't telling people about things they can try, hot baths, Vit C, garlic, ginkgo biloba, it won't cure you but it'll help, instead of "welp wait for a vaccine."

<|endoftext|>So I can only see the [abstract]( of the full study because you need to pay to get the full study, but somebody in the comments of the post said that they involve ["lots of insect traps set up in tons of places."]( The abstract seems to suggest this is the case ("166 long-term surveys of insect assemblages across 1676 sites to investigate trends in insect abundances over time").I don't know how reliable that method of studying is.../u/Saito1337, can you tell us about your experience a little more? Also maybe give your two cents?
<|endoftext|>I never said they no longer exist. I said Colony Collapse Disorder was related to a class of nicotine-based pesticides made by Bayer. So I'm not sure I understand your comment. These pesticides were banned for that specific reason in certain areas and the bees came back. I studied this extensively about 8 years ago.
<|endoftext|>That some towers are left with unused antenna is simply to block another privider from wanting that space on the tower. These towers are subject to far more loading then in days past, as we are installing the radio on the tower, and at ~30-50 pounds a radio, with 16-24 radios per site per carrier, that is a lot more weight on the tower then they were designed for. In places where tower sharing is mandated, each tower owner claims the prime locations for themselves, often hitting 100% + rated capacity on the tower. So along comes a competitor. They want access to tower space too. Except the prime locations are taken up, the carriers often leave only 3g antennae in place, but not connected, to deny them use of that area, then require the competitor to reinforce the already overloaded tower. Carriers don't fuck just the consumer. They fuck each other too.
<|endoftext|>I said a scientific paper. Not a banned YouTube video.You know, like, a paper. Look, I'm taking a neutral stance here in terms of the biological damage caused by 5G. I'm not going to accept either side's position without a scientific paper on the subject.FYI, I started out this conversation totally confident that 5G is harmless, but now I'm worried, genuinely, about its health effects. You're not screaming at a brick wall. I'm listening.
<|endoftext|>Rubbish. You only attacked the OP based on using a phone because you had nothing to say on the science. "it's garbage" isn't a valid opinion. You probably have no idea how electromagnetic fields affect the body, and think the only damage that you can do is by heating of the tissue, breaking the ionic bonds to damage DNA (ionizing radiation). There are many studies posted on this roundtable that flatly contradict that notion.You are probably not even aware that the brain responds to electromagnetic energy, so much that Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (or rTMS for short) is a [medically approved treatment for depression]( think you have no idea that electromagnetic sensitivity is a real condition, [and has been known about for a very long time]( \- though not talked about as it would threaten billions of dollars in many different technologies that emit large amounts of such energy.
<|endoftext|>[ results of our analysis show that acute exposure to ELF EMFs impacts upon the motor and cognitive abilities of bees and reduces feeding. We show, for the first time, that acute exposure to ELF EMFs causes a dose dependent reduction in olfactory learning. High levels of ELF EMFs, that can be experienced close to power lines, modify tethered flight by increasing wingbeat frequency. In addition, we show that exposure to low-level fields, at intensities found at ground levels below power lines, significantly reduces the number of successful foraging flights to a food source, and also leads to reduced feeding in bees.
<|endoftext|>I travel professionally too quite a lot, but I wont refer to some Ad Verecundiam fallacy.Look at your globe model. Makes no sense why they wouldnt fly directly from AUS to SA. No. And your argument of business model is weak to me and based on an assumption.Sure, not as many flights would go between those points in contrast to directly to the US.But there would definately be flights. How would a radar work on a globe?How would dolphins and whales be able to communicate if the sound waves would face curvature? Or are you saying those frequencies bends with the curve?
<|endoftext|>You could be correct, ill look up a source for it once I have time. Doesnt change my viewpoint of the question though.
<|endoftext|>"why" is a red herring. To hide God. Your solar system doesnt exist. Its not because of curvature, that use to be my main argument too. Zoom in with a camera next time that observation happens you will be able to see it again. Its just what it looks like from the human mind.The FE model explains all your question but you apparently arent capable of learning by yourself.NASA is a propaganda machine.
<|endoftext|>As you clearly use strawmen arguments and don't believe in staying on point I won't bother rebutting your non points.
<|endoftext|>ROFLMAO......I wish I could give you gold for that but I dont believe in paying billionaires for worthless shit so have my upvote instead.
<|endoftext|>If you know about Black Body radiation and Phase angle, it is just a small step up for you, just Google wave interference.
<|endoftext|> we should be able to see clear evidence of adverse effects by now.Unfortunately it's not that simpleAs I understand it, adverse effects from EMF radiation don't follow the same dose/effect pattern we see in normal toxicology.The amount of variables is so huge that organizations like ICNIRP have pretty much given up and only research things that are more easily documented and understood.
<|endoftext|>Nothing natural is going to cure COVID. You sound the the idiots on TV going on about silver supplements
<|endoftext|>Easier to link this. In there are the various methods, including pictures of various traps. We never did any of the hand counting (then again that seems deeply time consuming and we were being used as free labor to set up static traps...lol) but it's got great pictures of lots of trap types too. I'm going to assume that the study we are talking about used a mixed methodology and lots and lots of fun statistical projections. (caveat here is I'm no expert, my science degree is Genetics, not ecology, and our study methodology doesn't have much overlap unless it's a wildlife population genetics study which could be interesting)

<|endoftext|>Here is a compemdium of several dozen, mostly focused on DNA and cellular damage on everything from 3G up to 5G as well as proximity to cell phone towers.  don't expect you to go through all of them, I haven't yet myself. But I'd be curious to hear your thoughts if you have time to check some of the papers out.I respect your open minded approach. As a non scientist, I cannot speak for the voracity of the papers, which is why I would love to hear other scientifically- and open-minded individual's thoughts on these, as two brains are surely better than one = )Cheers,Char
<|endoftext|>This is true, but this is the norm in *those countries* which are primarily/ exclusively Islamic. It is not Islam itself which endorses such practices.
<|endoftext|> Nikah mut'ahThis is a practice in Twelver Shia Islam. Approximately 85% of the world's Muslims are Sunni and 15% are Shia Muslims, with most of those Shias belonging to the so-called Twelver tradition.Sunni Muslims refer to Shia as Rafidathose who reject. They have, in many ways, deviated greatly from the true teachings of Islam.In Sunni Islam, temporary marriages are prohibited because the "basic principle concerning marriage is that it should be ongoing and permanent". Read [this]( and [this]( as a start for more information regarding this matter.With that said, the temporary marriages the Shia engage in for sexual pleasure still appear, from my reading on the topic, to have many of the requirements of regular marriages in Islam, in that the woman has to give her consent, and her wali ("guardian", usually her father or brother) has to give her away in marriage. So...it is a marriage both parties agreed upon. What makes it unlawful is that the marriage was entered into with the intention of terminating it a short time thereafter.I would be interested in seeing your sources on temporary marriages being the "primary reason for trafficked CHILDREN in 'Islamic states'". Are you saying pre-pubescent girls are being forced by their fathers to marry old men for a few days and have sex with them in exchange for money that is then confiscated by their dad? Seeeeems like that's what you're suggesting. Source?
<|endoftext|>Yeah its all three wtf[ basically keep adding density in every way they can, balancing against cost of hardware
<|endoftext|>Course it won't. But neither do we have a conventional cure. We may as well do something to help. it's well known that garlic is an antiseptic agent and is also effective for altitude sickness in lieu of coca leaves. Raising body temp via baths is known to assist in fighting infections. Vit C is likely to help. Should us sick people just wait indefinitely until maybe a vaccine is produced? Since you began the ad hominem, you sound like a closed-minded imbecile indoctrinated by big pharma. Aspirin is just white willow bark. Penicillin is just fungus. There are plenty of plants with medicinal properties. They won't be as strong or effective as an antibiotic, if you have a bacterial infection... But this is a novel virus with no approved drugs, so I'd recommend getting your arrogant head out your ass. Good day.
<|endoftext|>Hope you and u/yb4zombeez don't mind if I jump in here, but I'd like to offer a little insight on this topic.First off, be very cautious when getting information from the EH Trust. It's run by Devra Davis, who has been making bold, sometimes unsupported claims about the negative effects of cellular radiation for years. As a result, this website frequently overstates the severity of the biological effects and it can leave you with a very warped view of what the research actually shows.As a counter-point to the very alarming tone of the EH Trust, I've found a much more even-handed blog written by a prominent biochemist who has advised numerous government bodies about the biological effects of RF.He has a ton of good information on there, but I suggest you read [this blog post in particular]( as it puts all the scary terms like "oxidative stress", "DNA damage" in perspective, and explains his view on how concerned we really should be about this stuff. (Be sure to read the latter half as it's where a lot of the key information is.)As a tl;dr - his view is that there is evidence to suggest potential adverse health effects, but no hard proof yet. More research is needed.
<|endoftext|>The topic to begin with was support for FE, but sure. The radars are an interesting point though. Also, The case of flights between AUS - SA is simply an interesting support for FE model. I think most people would agree to that. Is it definite proof of FE? No, but an interesting take on it. We're all on the same team here, I dont care about being right but I care about truth.

<|endoftext|>Idk it might take some meditation (sleep).But they seem to be claiming that they can be multiplied, filtered and decoupled?
<|endoftext|>[ Ima go sleep lol
<|endoftext|>Qantas does a flight to Santiago, Chili. These flights are like 14 hours and rare as most flights that long go to major hubs like London, Dubai, LAX, NYC etc. This is more efficient and commercially viable. Sorry but nothing to do with flat earth. There just isn't a huge demand for 14hr flights to South America from Australia. 
<|endoftext|>I finally understood it, it's pretty great. They doubled the data sent with minimal cost/equipment increase. The rest, however, is done on every kind of wave, even 2g waves. The waves can't reach us from the hundreds of miles (or something, idk) so repeaters are installed at intermediate locations to increase the strength of the waves **Multiplying**. (They are called something else) **filtering** is from background radiation and **Demodulation** is done by Modem. (Its full form is MOdulator DEModulator, your modem sends waves too.)
<|endoftext|>I made a post around a year ago about DUMBS and Phil Schneider. I'm sure there's literally mountains more information than what he has to say, but nonetheless, this is my contribution for those that are interested.
<|endoftext|>This cross post about [Cern and the Rainbow Bridge]( is pretty amazing.
<|endoftext|>Mt. Cheyenne is one of the largest and most secure D.U.M.B.s in the world probably. There is an entire underground system of transportation from DEN (Denver international airport). It is responsible for high value government individuals to bunker in case of world disaster or nuclear threat (I.e. President flies to DEN, transported securely underground to Mt. Cheyenne).
<|endoftext|>i'm partial to the line of thought that goes like this:  during the Cold War, the Rand corporation developed a system for boring perfectly smooth tunnels underground, with the intention of making a network of high speed magnetic levitation trains. ([  This system of maglev trains was made to connect a series of deep underground bases. We know of a few- the ones underneath Mt. Cheyenne (mentioned in another post in this thread), supposedly Dulce, San Diego/Coronado naval base, and on the East coast there are apparently networks of bunkers in the DMV area meant for continuity of government in the case of a national emergency- but apparently there are many.  What goes on in these bases? Speculation ranges from aliens, to genetic manipulation, to black project research, but I think continuity of government, classified military operations/technology and possibly storage of sensitive technology and weaponry are pretty safe to say have something to do with whatever's going on down there.  We know that Russia and China have these bases- so it's pretty safe to say that the US does too. And it's possible that the major metropolitan areas of the US as well as major military bases are connected by these maglev trains.
<|endoftext|>Growing up playing half life made me fall in love with black mesa and all these underground bases and I have read all the material that is available about anything underground, books, articles and stories. It really is a shame this topic isn't being discused more thoroughly on the subreddit and it's also a shame we will never know what is going on down there.
<|endoftext|>It's not quite DUMBS but multiple remote viewers have identified underground bases inside mountains - one in Alaska, one in Australia, one in Zimbabwe, and one in the Pyrenees. There's a PDF on the CIA website about it
<|endoftext|>Beale AFB near Yuba City in California has underground bunkers that are currently being built. There is 24/7 truckloads of dirt leaving the base all the time, night and day.
<|endoftext|>Nobody's mentioned Pine Gap, the biggest black ops site in Australia. it's also the site of many ufo sightings and other strange business. Supposedly it's a center for the Five Eyes project, cooperation between American and British/Commonwealth intelligence agencies and a place with a large underground component including a very long boreshaft containing a large antenna which emits extremely low frequency waves. For what purpose? Who knows
<|endoftext|>Its either Schneider or no Schneider.The size and scope of todays boring machines And the mountainous caverns we know ofThe old NORAD siteThe Dulce base.
<|endoftext|>From a logical perspective, there has to be DUMBS. Aerial aircrafts, drones and satellites are hovering around the earth at all times taking pictures and using ground penetrating radar to see stuff. We have to have a more protected way to hide experimental technology, to secure sites and other similar stuff. Whether there are 90 mile tunnels connecting different bases, I have no clue. It seems like a lot of work to bore tunnels underground, but its within the realm of possibility.

<|endoftext|>Serious question does anyone else have the Reddit phone app close on you while reading conspiracy theorist material ? I have had this happen a few times usually while reading something about the elites and other planes of existence and when I go to finish reading the article its no where to be found . It cant be because the article was presenting false information because Ive seen some pretty outlandish things on conspiracy subs that remain for forever . Has anyone else had this happen to them ?
<|endoftext|>I think Stockton, CA has DUMBs because when I lived there I would hear these strange loud booms at night all the time.
<|endoftext|>Operation Highjump? [

Would the MSM not be able to reach thier propaganda hands out to cradle every hungry mind and bring it in to suckle on the governments supple bossum? Does the cern and 5g have something to do with the way alien spacecrafts use elecromatic waves and amplify them . The water to air crafts the military released seem to be much like the aliens spacecrafts. Or was cern really a way to open a portal to another dimension and in turn threw our world into a constant state of flux of dimensions . Does nikola tesla vision of turning everyone into gods have anything to do with it ... I wonder

<|endoftext|>I used to be all about whistleblowers from the government about aliens and dumbs and stargates etc but they never had any proof of their claims. I lump them in with the fringe quantum physicists and new age channelers who make large claims with very little (or none at all) proof. I'd love there to be space faring aliens from the 4th D and galactic federations and underground bases with allies from other worlds but I just can't get on board. Nothing I could build a foundation on at least.
<|endoftext|>There are some things that are misleading in this post. Most of the stuff said by astrophysicist today is based on unproven theories and not on observation. Most of the models they craft do not match with the observation at all. It's something that we need to remember. Also, black holes are a very popular subject and many people build extremly entertaining theories but it doesn't mean they are all true. In fact, since most theories around black holes do contradict other theories, some of them MUST BE WRONG. I believe that most (but not all) of what we are hearing today about black holes, worm holes, time travel and the like are either : - disinformation - pure fantasies You might not believe me. But there has been a big mistake in our interpretation of "black holes", it came from an incomprehension of Schwarzschild equations (written in 1906), some very talented people (including Hilbert) misinterpreted the variable named "R" for a radius when it was just a coordinate. This lead many people to believe that "a black hole must have a center". This error was only discovered recently by a well known french scientist. This is the paper :  Basicly what he says is this : - When a neutron star "collapse", the pression at the center becomes infinity long before the star becomes a black hole. This is a problem. - The model of the black holes "where space and time inverse themselves" is completely bulshit and is as nonsensical as having negative distances (or in that case having imaginary values for coordinates). In that case, the equations tells us that the neutron star ceases to have a center (for a brief period of time) and that some of its matter (the one at the center) is expulsed into our dual universe. - That dual universe flows back in time, has negative particles, and its energy is negative. You could theoritically go from one universe to the other. However you CAN'T use this to travel in time, because whenever you would want to go back to the second universe, you would not reach the second universe before you would go back to "the current time of the universe". (This is a bit incorrect as there is no "current universal time for the universe" but it gives an idea why it's not possible to go back in time). Here is a visual representation of "the inversion of mass phenomenon" :  The star pulls the cloth down, and when it reaches a critical mass, the cloth tears and let some mass go through it and into our dual universe. During this process, the mass is inverted and so is the time. Since the star lost some mass, the cloth reforms to it's previous state. No black hole has ever been made in the process.

<|endoftext|>This is really weird, but in almost all the murals in DEN, they include some sort of rainbow bridge. This is especially weird since it is in fairly close proximity to Mt. Cheyenne. This shit is starting to weird me out
<|endoftext|>I have to say, the talk of "a mirror universe... where the laws of physics run opposite to ours", "a world where everything works backward", and most of all "dig a tunnel into another reality" sounds a whole lot like the show Stranger Things.

<|endoftext|>Welcome! Round Tables are meant as an antidote to the ADD-ridden nature of reddit and social media in general.It's really difficult to have an in depth discussion on "controversial" or otherwise speculative topics in the world of 24-hour news cycles and the constant barrage of fake news and fake outrage being spewed by the Mockingbird Media.As a result, the "round table" discussion on /r/conspiracy is meant to be a stickied thread that is pinned above the fluff, allowing for increased visibility on otherwise marginalized or neglected topics.Specifically, the Round Table focuses on "high octane" speculation and other areas that might not get as much play, especially in the current hyper-politicized environment that is now bleeding into the realm of conspiracy.

<|endoftext|>Https://www.stealthskater.com is a great research resource.Also this YT Channel 'It's Redacted':  occult/esoteric and secret societies exist because we live in a multi-dimensional 'reality'.

<|endoftext|>Hmm I'm not sure I understand properly what you are saying. On the "one way membrane", actually you can go in both "directions". However in our universe it does happen naturaly (collapsing of a neutron star), but it doesn't happen naturally in the other universe (the constants are not the same and there wouldn't be any neutron star). However it could potentially be artificially created. Well this model combines a lot of ideas, it's not extremely hard to understand most of its concepts but it would be very long to explain everything. So what are the proofs that this model might be correct? There is no hard proof but we can check if the model is coherent with the observation. Right now this model is able to explain :  - what is darkmatter and dark energy (basicly just anti matter of negative mass) - the absence of observable antimatter (it's in our dual universe and only interact with ours through gravity). - the presence of a great repeller (it's an amass of anti matter of negative mass) - the homogenous cosmic background (explained by a faster celerity of light at the early stages of the universe) - the structure in spirals of some galaxies (it's confined by antimatter) - many other stuff You know that black holes defies basic laws of physics? As once the star collapsed into the black there is a loss of information... unless it's not lost, but happens to be in another accessible universe.
<|endoftext|>Matter isnt going anywhere. Most of everything is like 99% space. When matter goes into a black hole all the space between atoms gets compressed.
<|endoftext|>Just imagine that our universe is floor number two and that the other universe is floor number one. In our universe the time arrow is positive meaning that our floor is always going up in altitude. While floor number one has a negative arrow of time, meaning that it's going down. Our universes are going further and further apart. Now you can create a temporary stair to go from one universe to the other, in this process the arrow of time is reversed (and so is the mass and the energy). However you will not reach the second universe untill you reach floor 1. So basically you can't go back in time.
<|endoftext|>Crazy to know that we cant know. It could really be nothing unethical, no super dubiose shit to whatever .. we dont talk about.I somewhat hesitate wanting to believe the latter though knowing that we are human beings for what we are, emotional and emphatic.

<|endoftext|>Everything is exactly opposite in the other universe. By being in the second universe you are going backwards (compared to us) in time by default. if you come from the second universe to our universe you are going to the future. If then you return to your originating universe after the fact, you would have gone back in your universes time. Otherwise you will just come back to the same time but younger. Either way, whether your body, or your surroundings changed, something went back in time.Our past is the second universes future, our future is their past. So yea time travel is possible if that universe actually exists and we can get into it.

Because you obviously dont- 200 years of police murders isnt a stage youre even permitted to cry foul on. So you can take that weak argument to a weaker member. Apparently this sub is in bigger trouble than I implied! The anger is real & we are not backing down. Take that to the stage.Not the first round table, no- YES the first pinned roundtable Ive seen in a year. I know what *specifically meant to focus on high octane speculation* means- thats what I was referring to , remember? Youre an admin you know very well the admin fiasco of a month ago. So lets not pretend Reddit isnt censored, k. Youre doing that as we speak.
<|endoftext|> I ask, again, where is the proof for the existence of a tangible parallel universe?I gave you five observations. How many do you want ? Maybe read the fucking articles instead of being condescending? There are 12 different observations that are better explained by this model than the current concurrent lambda cdm model. Now need I say that the "string theory" is a bunch of bulshit tied together that doesn't predict anything? No. Just no. "Negative Mass" is itself an oxymoron. Mass implies the existence of Matter, regardless of polar charge, configuration, or composition. To assert that there can be a negative value volume of ANY type of Mass would then immediately bring the concept of "Anti-Mass" into existence, which would utterly destroy all known scientific models, theorems, and hypothesii. Yes we might need to revisit some old theories. In a kinetics perspective, "Negative Mass" would simply mean the object or mass in question would simply accelerate itself with no initial input, driving force, or other interaction with anything else, which itself, is a violation of thermodynamics and entropy. That is fucking dumb. Electrons and protons have opposite charge values and there is no violation of thermodynamics and entropy. You are just spouting bullshit. Also if you fucking read the website you would have seen that he states that in his model :   Particles with mass of same signs mutually attract through Newton's law.   Particles with mass of opposite signs mutually repel through "anti-Newton's law"."But hey, there is no evidence that matter could be repulsed by an amass of unknown origin". WRONG : that  . Mass is both a property of a physical body and a measure of its resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. An object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies. An innate negative value to such a thing would mean it is possible to destroy ENERGY, as ENERGY is also with mass. Read the fucking website. They also explain how an energy can be negative. There are many videos explaining it. I'm not going to explain to you what is already explained here. In what way do photons possess sentience, sapience, and the ability to reason, in order to even attain a state of celerity? One does not use the word "celerity" as a modifier for anything except thought processes in the modern day, we do not use "celerity" to refer to kinetic motion. The Speed of Light is the ultimate hard limit that the Universe possesses, and although sci-fi in general keeps trying and trying to explain, postulate, and promote potential Faster Than Light velocities and means to attain them, it is a pipe dream, and that's why it's FICTION. The speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercase c, for "constant" or the Latin celeritas (meaning "swiftness, celerity"). That's in wikipedia. Do go on. I want to see where this nonsense ultimately leads to. I have all the time in the world to wait for you to try and defend this poorly thought out "model." Oh since you have the time can you please explain me what correct predictions were made by the "string theory model"? I also have all the time. You are like a little entitled kid spouting "TEACH ME THIS MODEL" and "THIS MODEL IS BULLSHIT" at the same time. If you have time to read and answer these questions, you have the time to read the fucking websites. You are not a kid and you can fucking teach yourself. Or if you don't want to, you can leave, because right now you have no clue of what you are talking about. If you want to LEARN what this model is about there is a 20 hour long video series on this subject. There are also a few dozens of peer reviewed articles that were linked if you prefer a more scientific format. But yeah you will have to take some time and make some efforts, because there are many revolutionary ideas in this model and some are very hard to understand. If the model was easy to detract by any scientist, the scientific papers would have never been accepted. Now if you have "all the time in a world" to debunk this model, I invite you to write a scientific paper and publish it.
<|endoftext|>There are negatively charged particles so the fact that a particle can have a negative mass shouldn't bother you. Everything is written in that website, so I'm not going to paraphrase everything that is already written. Especially since you have already made up your mind on this subject despite clearly not understanding anything about it.

<|endoftext|>Ok well you have fun discussing aliens & CERN on a pinned roundtable, while the country is rioting. Lol
<|endoftext|>Okay, [does this look routine to you? ]( Its the **first time** the police are out here fucking up kids & grandmas, black & white- like its 1957 so how about have a seat / Im fighting in defense of your little idiot neck too- and youre welcome. Red and black necks- you think this is about race? Its literally what you saw in Hong Kong 6 months ago & thought , wow Chinas a dick for that. These are war crimes- you think this is an Obama era kumbaya? Think again. See its real simple/ the police werent permitted to retaliate at protests for 8 years during the O Admin. They didnt engage period-, barely spoke to people in protest. & now theyre fucking us up- end of story. As someone supporting BLM for 10 years Im not going out to protest & losing a fucking eye. Yall go ahead, gen Z & thats your neck. Start protecting yourselves- we never said we needed people so peaceful theyre happy to lay down & die. Dead people are peaceful too.

<|endoftext|>Though I agree more with the other person in terms of remaining open minded and ascertaining new theories, I most certainly agree with you that many people on this sub are horrible spokesmen for the unorthodox beliefs they have (and I'm saying this as someone with some very unorthodox beliefs - I am actually a metaphysical idealist and believe the Universe is a mental construct - for some great academic stuff on that I would like to direct you to www.bernardokastrup.com ).Either way, being unnecessarily aggressive in a debate is most certainly not the way to win someone over and indeed not the way out of current academic orthodoxy. So I encourage you to remain open minded and check alternative scientific theories *in spite* of some of the people that seem to represent and espouse them.Much love.
<|endoftext|>It's more like you have 2 very slow trains leaving from the same city but each going in a different direction (the starting city is the big bang). Each train is one universe. (There is no double of you in the other universe). Now you can leave the train, take an airplane and catch the other train (that's the inversion of mass/energy/time process), however you can't make the trains go back (meaning you can't go back in time). And you can't actually use the airplane to do anything but catch the other train. This can seem dull, however there are other properties that are interesting in this "dual" universe, the speed of light could be up to 10 times faster in that universe while distances could be divided by a factor of a hundred. This would mean that interstellar travel could be possible in the future. Other than that that, that universe wouldn't be "that interesting", life wouldn't originate naturally in this universe.
<|endoftext|>The reality we inhabit is the coalescence of the multiverse. Imagine lots of different vibrations in an empty void. As in the void itself is vibrating at different frequencies and places. Some of these frequencies will begin to effect each other and create standing waves. We are those waves. Attempting to hop into the less dense fields of vibration is akin to a thought experiment. Traveling in an out these (IMHO) is no more difficult and no more productive than just that, a thought experiment. Sure you can get there, but what's the point. You can only have an effect on the real mass here in this space and time.
<|endoftext|>Thank you , & everyone here for participating. Why, I may be more popular here than CERN & aliens combined. Imagine that. Lol. My work here is done,  But Ill gladly respond to every one to two syllable insult yall can muster up! Im dumb, fat, a cunt & an idiot. Thats it my feelings are hurt-  Almost like you wish you could say n...ni.. but Im white so naturally, only cunt will do. 
<|endoftext|>When the fuck did I say it was routine? I said it was inorganic. Manufactured. A psy op. Also, I honestly do not understand what or where you're throwing energy at in that paragraph. It seems, scattered?
<|endoftext|>If we allow the police force to be militarized or under federal control , you can expect things will get worse , not better . Dont sign away your last chance for something you dont understand.
<|endoftext|>Literally untrue. Weve filmed the black hole at the center of our galaxy.I mean you can be pedantic and say its not possible to film one but you can by observing its effects on its surroundings.
<|endoftext|>Hahah the policee & ya mom for raising a child who uses phrases like monstrous cunt. Youd only hope to find one of those
<|endoftext|>OH we know you dont understand- So, you should probably just talk about CERN- you know, something you could possibly ever comprehend. & the reason youve sat at the roundtableThis gigantic PSYOP will get you killed. Lol so whats it matter? But colliding atoms- totally more your speed.
<|endoftext|>79days old comment dude. Blacks holes can't exist, it contradicts every law of physics. So unless you have some model that doesnt contradict : entropy, infinite pressure at the center (before the black holes even appear), time changing to space inside the black hole (this is the most stupid one and easy to show the mistake). Now if we assume black holes can exist. There is no proof that the mass at the center of the galaxy is actually a black hole. It could simply be some dark objects (like many neutron stars). But hey, everyone likes black holes so let's continue talking about black holes.
<|endoftext|>The first sentence or two was fine. The reason I didnt understand the rest is because it is what appears to be a strange series of thoughts mashed together in an unclear and obscure fashion. Your inability to convey messages properly has no impact on my intellect or ability to comprehend other nonrelated subjects.I did not say the situation has no substance. I never once said it did not matter lol what I did say is that this is an inorganic, manufactured movement to distract the public from the COVID bullshit prior to as well as distract from what's occurring and is about to come. Your shitty passive-aggressive sarcasm paints you brighter and brighter as a monstrous cunt. Please, continue
<|endoftext|>I was replying to another reply and replied to you , but to answer your question .. I guess I am now , unintentionally.
<|endoftext|>I think theyre pretty intuitive. The space time symmetry breaking doesnt seem too strange considering the strange behaviors of quantum objects.Youre right that the supermassive hole at the center of our galaxy could be some kinds of strange exotic super dense star but that is supported by much less science as far as I can tell.Black holes, despite their novelty, seem to be fairly well understood (to the extent we can understand them with our current models of reality)Sorry I replied. I didnt realize this was such a sensitive topic for you.
<|endoftext|>This seems less of a refusal of black holes and more redefining the trajectory of matter lost to them. Thanks for the link.Isnt this pretty fringe though? Theres a remarkably robust body of work supporting the existence of black holes. It would seem to be the consensus.
<|endoftext|>Oh god, anything but the pseudo intellectual. Haha. Ahem- Valiant effort in the execution of particular phrases which are supposed to indicate youre of substantial intelligence. All while unawares your tactics only prove successful in debates among real imbeciles. Fancy language for congrats, you lost.
<|endoftext|>BTW- Have you been to publicfreakout as of late? Sort of like Reddits temporary go-to for all the brutality videos. Because for the past week, I can only comment once every 10 minutes. Or Im doing that too much - 10 minutes while everyone rips me a new one. Haha- its my most heavily censored Reddit moment, ever. Who knew the admins could manipulate bugs like that? In an organic situation, youd have to comment 15-20 times , in a short period, to get that message.
<|endoftext|>Quantum physics are the opposite of black holes. Quantum physics describes perfectly what it tries to describe. It's just that our brain feels that some results should be different, but equations don't lie and experiments prove that they are correct. On the other hand, we have some ideas with black holes, no experiment was ever made, nothing that was ever predicted ocured (the collision of supposed black holes didn't do what they were thought to do) and our black hole models contradicts our other models. Space and time inversion is just the result of incorrect ideas/calculus and lost in translation concepts. You can read the article that I linked you. Maybe I can find a video that explains it better.
<|endoftext|> It's explained in the first 20mins. However I don't know if you will be able to digest it without looking at the previous videos. (it's in french but there are english subtitles that you can turn on).
<|endoftext|>It astounds me that simply by using proper and more effective vocabulary you've dubbed me a "pseudo-intellectual". That has to be one of the most stupid assumptions, based off virtually nothing, that I've witnessed as of late. The fact that you instantly jump ship from the initial topic of debate (BLM and its lack of organic spark) to attacking me, and rather poorly, in a weak attempt at degrading me as a person instead of my point of argument speaks volumes. It very clearly illuminates your lack of intelligence, ironically just after your substance-less assumptions about my own.Keep on gabbing away though, Champ. You'll win one, some day.
<|endoftext|>I think it's because I flip between the app and the website sometimes, and I'm still fairly new so I mess up more often than I'd like to, since they put the place to type under the place to reply..
<|endoftext|>I've gotten it before as well , but from only commenting once . I also got a shit ton of likes and nothing but hate in the comments of a post . I dont understand how it got so screwed up on reddit . The shills and trolls never sleep .
<|endoftext|>Organic intellectuals convey that in their thoughts. Not their vocabulary- your more effective writing reads like a Dickens novel. I hope you dont do this often- all Im saying- no paragraphs required. Less is more, Charles. Yeah BLM lacks an organic start- loool. Ill win someday & Ill send you a postcard. Fair?
<|endoftext|>That is entirely incorrect. Language and vocabulary used to be very formal and proper. Over time, the majority became lazy and cut corners. I happen to choose to speak with more range and variety because we have a wealth of vocabulary to draw on for a reason. We have words like sad, melancholic, depressed, morose, etc., all words defining a relative emotion but the depths and implications of which can differ drastically. Your inability to think and convey through limited vocabulary attests solely to your lack thereof. You can try to rationalize with yourself the whole "ur dumb im smart" scenario as much as you want, friend. It'll get you no closer to the intelligence you so desperately want me to believe you possess.
<|endoftext|>Why, because I added "ery" to cunt? Lmao right.Why do you keep bringing up CERN? I havent once mentioned it, as it doesn't pertain to this conversation lol again, this is what I mean about you jumping ship to random and often superficial arguments. Learn to debate, dude.
<|endoftext|>Oh FFS- why would I need to argue with you when youve proved my original point? LolLearn what debate youre in, dude! This roundtable post youre **commenting on right now!!** was an attempt to distract from wtf is going on. I pointed it out- and you cunty cunts argued with me for hours- instead of discussing aliens & CERN- as per the pinned post. SO really you havent known what youre even debating with me about this entire thread. Yet youve effectively illustrated my point- no one wants to talk about CERN right now.
<|endoftext|>Again, entirely incorrect. Your basis for everything seems to rest weakly upon your shortsighted assumptions. I opened the post on a whim and saw your shenanigans on first take. My intent here was never specifically to read or discuss/debate CERN. That is simply another one of your silly little assumptions. Do you react to all things in life solely founded upon conjecture and blind inference?
<|endoftext|>Yet again, you avoid my points of debate and continue to circle around to superficial and redirectory statements. Yep, definitely leaves you as the victor in this fine conversation 
<|endoftext|>Youve made zero points- could you bullet them for me, they mustve escaped me somewhere in your third manifesto.  are you afraid Ill go troll public freakout brutality posts & leave this nothing debate?  Im sensing some despair.

<|endoftext|>This will get ignored:  is like, the Simpsons season 2, holy fucking shit.
<|endoftext|>Theres a lot to unpack here. The pineal gland, AKA the Third Eye, produces and regulates serotonin levels. Its responsible for regulating your sleeping pattern, and its secretions *inhibit* the development of sexual reproduction glands. Thats important. Basically, it means that you can speed up the development of sexual reproductive organs through suppressing secretions of the pineal gland. Were talking about a elite global pedo-ring here. Over time, the pineal gland calcifies. This limits secretions, and thus limits production of melatonin and serotonin. It also speeds up the process of sexual gland development. Calcification also makes it more difficult to regulate sleeping patterns. De-calcification can be achieved through Iodine supplements, but thats been largely removed from the standard human diet. Iodine deficiency is linked to intellectual and developmental disabilities, effecting more than 2 billion worldwide. We primarily rely on iodized salt to prevent iodine deficiency - but Im beginning to doubt that its enough. Notice how mental/psychological disorders have made a much larger presence in society over the last 20 years? Not to mention, theres been a huge push to normalize LGBT culture *for children.* That sounds like the work of an elite global pedophile ring to me. Anyway, moving on, an un-calcified pineal gland is **only** going to be in the brains of **young children.** Im no doctor, but I would imagine that theres a significant difference in the secretions of a calcified and un-calcified gland.
<|endoftext|>Adrenochrome is a byproduct of adrenaline (the flight version to be specific) which is extracted from the children they kidnapped. The fucked up thing is that they do horrible things to the children and scare using methods such as rape and other torturing methods, and once the adrenochrome is produced they slit their throats (in result killing them) so they can in term inject it into them. And to put it into retrospect this shit is more powerful than the purest form of meth and coke combined. This makes them feel incredibly powerful and invincible, and in a way it does give them a lot of energy which is why they live long lives. However, when too much of it is ingested they also ingest the thyroid substance in the adrenochrome, called thyrotoxicosis. A sign of this is when they develop a black eye. This is why in some pictures you can see the elite, politicians, celebrities, royals, and other luciferians have black eyes. Even OBAMA does it, its really fucked up. Its ridiculous that people dont want to admit satanism is still around and has widespread practise but want to know when there favourite soulless pop stars release there new song? What a society we live in, America is the worst offender of this and i'm saying that as a person that lives in the UK.

<|endoftext|>The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.Allegations started coming out in 1996, the FBI knew, the founder of Reddit knew about them in 2011. Everyone knew. Why was nothing done? Perhaps the FBI knows they won't win, they'll be fired. Those who knew but couldn't do anything, didn't do anything because they're rightfully scared, or they have something to hide themselves. These people will kill you and your families. They will dig up so much dirt on you and make you look like such a shitty person that nobody will listen to you. You'll never be hired again. Blacklisted.Consider the track record and known programs ran by the CIA, PSYOPS, MKULTRA, MONARCH. Why stop? JFK assassination, bay of pigs, "war on drugs", false flag attacks like 9/11 to invade the middle East. Etc. They fight dirty. Very dirty.Some people can be very efficiently brainwashed and controlled, systematic abuse of all kinds for as long as it takes. Until this person dissassociates, the mind shuts itself off as a survival mechanism. During this time the mind is split, the portion thats you is hidden away. What's left is blank, programmable. The mind is made whole again and whatever they put in there is with you for life and off you go, never being able to remember, never being able to forget. You'll do what they want, devoid of emotion, morals, fear for self. Pushing their agenda. That's how he killed himself.My theory is Epstein and Maxwell were victims of this programming, Then they get another great idea. How do you control people if you can't get to their heads? You get videos of them fucking kids, getting peed on by Russian prostitutes, involved with drugs. Etc. If you can get dirt on people in power like Prince Philip, Trump, Clinton's, Bush's. The Pope. You control them, and thus you control whatever they control. This was the objective of PSYOPS. This was their mission.Where does adrenochrome fit? They either take it themselves or use it for brainwashing.

<|endoftext|>There is a fairly easy to hear subliminal audio message in the movie Dr. Sleep - time stamp 1:40:21. "Adrenochrome" is clearly audible as one of the villians screams and dies.

<|endoftext|>As a bit of lateral thinking, certainly not to excuse the abhorrent use of the oligarch class, I've been pondering the role that adrenochrome might serve in the natural world.

<|endoftext|>Gotta ask you why Epstein took the 5th when asked if he'd ever seen Trump with an underage girl. If the answer is " NO" , its quite simple to say so. If the answer is " Yes" and you don't want to say so & risk perjury you take the 5th.
<|endoftext|>I saw a post on main page about an Irish citizen being pissed at US citizens for traveling to his country because of "Coronavirus." Does anyone else not see the problems here? When every country is demanding every citizen stay within their own boarders and no one gets to come out of their home or communicate face to face with each other. This is all so fucked up. We are cranking global hostility to a level it has not seen in some time.

<|endoftext|>You mention someone trying it and recording their experience, ~a week ago a user on r/adrenochrome purchased a vjal and intends to use it and make a post on how it affected him. Here is the original post: automod got angry at me
<|endoftext|>This is an impressive wide ranging and deep ground work of many roads leading to AC damn good work.In Pursuit of Truth has done some great work on EpiPens in schools and poss. links to AC:*"The Bite Pt. I"* Bite Pt. II"* related:*"Up2Snuff - In Pursuit of Truth Presents - 3.17.20"* Evergreen II Pt. series about CPS services in Michigan and the children who go missing there. Too often. *"Detroit Evergreen - In Pursuit of Truth Presents - 1.6.20"* Evergreen II - In Pursuit of Truth Presents - 1.13.20"* can look at alibaba listings for synthetic AC. Some supposedly even claim to be from "organic sources": Truthers Adrenochrome mini doco playlist:*"Adrenochrome The Elites Super Drug | Follow The White Rabbit"* lots of early "schizophrenia treatment research" carried out by doctors that overlap with MK Ultra, Huxley, UK secret services, Tavistock, William Sargeant, US Ivy League unis etc...namely Humphrey Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Smythies et al:*"The Adrenochrome Hypothesis and Psychiatry"* Effect of Adrenochrome and Adrenolutin On the Behavior of Animals and the Psychology of Man"* Hoffer's 60 Years of Research and Discovery of the Orthomolecular Approach to Psychiatry"* as Hard Science: The Adrenochrome Hypothesis for the Biogenesis of Schizophrenia"* sure you take your niacinamide folks.Supposedly also the preference? predominance of trafficked black African children is due to the intensity of the AC able to be harvested from them. You have to look this sick topic up yourselves. Start with "walnut sauce".These sick perverts have been doing this for a long time. They weaponized psychiatry decades ago looking for "therapeutic aids and treatments for human suffering" but really have obviously been tormenting, torturing and continuing on that pagan, black magic sacrificial ritual observance, blood libel, Molech/Baal/Golden Calf/Saturn/Black Cube sacrifice since time immemorial simply cloaking it in purported "scientific respectability" and clinical language.Check out Jasun Horsely's YT channel and book "The Vice of Kings".Check out one of Jay Dyer's recent interviews with Chris Thrall on YT. They go into child sacrifice and AC after a while. It's a damn good contemporary CT culture breakdown and update on the general lay of the land as to how different elitist creep agendas and power structures interlock and how AC might fit in there.Good thread, lets get at it, dig dig dig, share, share, share.
<|endoftext|>Just wow. You have my condolences friend, it is soul destroying to have to know these things are real and no one believes you. In my work we deal with literally hundreds of child sexual abuse survivors. It is not something I even mention because normal people are not ready to psychologically assimilate this information. If you ever want to stop a dinner party conversation in its tracks, you mention this stuff. I am so impressed with your research and your dedication so many thanks to you brave truth warrior. One day maybe things will change. I can only hope that day comes sooner rather than later.
<|endoftext|>When you say adrenochrome is for blood coagulation, I'm immediately reminded of all the royalty that had hemophilia from years of inbreeding. Even many of the royals believed that drinking blood from healthy individuals would help their hemophilia, thus lending credence to the fables of vampires around the time of Vlad the Impaler. Also, stories of the Dutchess of Balthoy.
<|endoftext|>There is also the case of Peter Scully. Right there on the internet: These people are sick.
<|endoftext|> The Catholic Church is an army of pedophiles and pedophile enablers 100,000 strong.Remember how Italy supposedly allowed all those immigrant families from Africa to enter their country under the remit of "humanitarian aid"?!What happened to those families & their children?!Post WWII The Vatican/Catholic church was the biggest smuggler of people on the planet. into the history of  Monsignor Luigi Maglione. As early as 1942 he was developing a people smuggling ring between the holy city and contacts in Argentina. Those "Ratlines" never stopped. That same infrastructure is still in place. Except now it is being used to traffic small children. OSS/CIA/MI6 are awash in children's blood going back decades.Disrupt those modern day Ratlines and you disrupt the access to children.
<|endoftext|> adrenochrome seems to be for people with blood coagulation problemsMakes me wonder if the COVID-19 blood clotting issues would be better or worse for someone on AC, or has used it.
<|endoftext|>If you're killing babies you might as well drink their blood, youve already crossed the threshold. I think the adrenochrome aspect is just a bonus for these sickos. And as a practicing occultist, yes disassociates are used ritualistically. Going beyond the self and the ego into a more raw and animalistic state. As you've mentioned though it can be synthesized quite easily, so I don't think that's the goal, like I said just sick, sick bonus points.
<|endoftext|>#StopKillingKidsHelp start a movement.
<|endoftext|>Is there a difference in anyway between consuming a synthesized version of it as opposed to getting it organically? Other than the ritual of torturing and murdering a child? I can't imagine it's not as "thrilling" or "spiritual" to just take a modified Epi-pen, as opposed to the actual ritual.
<|endoftext|>It might have to do with creating dissociative identity disorder in an intentional, ritualistic way. Controlled Dissociation seems to be part of a process that destroys most people (do they get eaten?) but some make it through the process and have multiple personalities... manchurian candidates for Satan, basically. But that is a whole other conversation.I just a comment about this in this thread :[ several people that have been through the exact said same thing. Some appeared to be recruits of some kind. Others talked a lot about cannibalism to various degrees. I have also noticed that over the last year or so, meat has turned up in restaurants and super markets that does not have proper flavour, (such as chicken or beef that tasted like pork) and which induced "cannibal shakes"when I tried to eat it. They and myself were also subjected to gang stalking and weird cryptic threats, given in arranged encounters with members of the group. Their ideological ties seem to be all over the fucking place, which leads me to believe that they are running several operations out of religious, ideological, and criminal front groups, many of which are not aware of the other.
<|endoftext|> Cannibalism is realI just ran across this 4ch thread today (NSFL): Pic of what appears to be a human -- beheaded, roasted, and served as one would a turkey.
<|endoftext|>I just got shook when I saw the article from Buffalo NY....this is all so intense but feels so scary and true
<|endoftext|>I'm not a conspiracy nut (I mostly read this stuff for fun - you lose me halfway through once you started writing about pizza-gate nonsense) but a decent chunk of this comment has merit. I did some digging around the cannibal topic and I can confirm that there is a lot of spooky stuff out there.

<|endoftext|>Children's blood as a medicine has been a concept for like, all of human history.Off the top of my head I know there was a myth that Jews drank babies blood during the holocaust. Also witches would kill children and use their blood for potions.It probably because childrens blood is like, the least fucking holy thing you could think of because children are pure and innocent.
<|endoftext|>Flouride does the same thing, not saying your wrong. But it's certainly easier to acquire. Perhaps it's too toxic.
<|endoftext|>Is it just a biproduct of their rituals, discovered while worshipping? There seems to be belief in spiritual or mental planes that intertwine with the physical one. Are the rituals to please a belief held in the other side? What do they call this place? Always seems like theres something going over my head on the cultist ideal. Are they worshipping eachother or some divine belief?
<|endoftext|>Married a Brit and I feel that UK citizens are just as clueless, If not more, than most Americans. It dosnt take for someone to be British/American to want to open their eyes to this shit. Most people just don't care or don't want to even imagine it's true..better to pretend
<|endoftext|>Literally none of this is true, for fucks sake even if adrenochrome had those properties you can make it out of fucking epipens so why would they kill random kids for it? You think anyone could be smart enough to hide such a massive conspiracy yet dumb enough not to do a quick Google search?
<|endoftext|>Wait, how does the black eye play into this? Have seen photos but dont understand how a chemical would cause bruising around just an eye.

<|endoftext|>Justin Beiber fans are actually more versed on the little hints in this video than most so check out some of the fan-analyses on YouTube. Basically it's all out of character for him and the video itself has many red flags in it which point to child abuse and tasteless sex abusers. The people in the video seem to refer to Jenny McCarthy who did this to him on stage:And John Podesta with the round glasses, and his old manager in the back at the end who said he looked 'beautiful like a girl'. Notice the kids in the video are used as entertainment for the elite, and at the end the red dress belonging to the underage girl is left by the table, insinuating she has been abused during the party, with Podesta still eating at the end of the video.
<|endoftext|>Ya know. Given that Hunter S Thompson did know some shit.. I'll give this theory a VERY druggy 5 points.
<|endoftext|>I've only seen the scene where he takes the droplets and starts making weird noises. What happens after that if anything?
<|endoftext|>That's because Hunter Thompson chose the name for legal purposes. He said he made it up, but that was also for legal purposes.There is an actual 'adrenochrome' it refers to, otherwise it would become just another nickname for whatever he was referring to. Thompson used it as a catch all for when people combined drugs and destructive and/or illegal behavior. In "Fear and Loathing" his lawyer's "adrenochrome binge" is when he wrecks a hotel room and screws an underage girl.The real adrenochrome is a chemical related to the neurotransmitter epinephrine and has 'no abuse potential' which is a main DEA criteria for whether a substance is illegal or not.Most of what is being talked about now about adrenochrome is complete disinformation. It's a waste of time meant to distract people. Consider what that means in this context. If you spend your time looking up adrenochrome related stuff, you'll never cause any trouble for them.Whereas if you start investigating specific people of national stature or in your own community, you might put together something that looks pretty bad from a collection of publicly available images and it could actually result in a real investigation having to take place. And then a real coverup has to take place or people actually go to jail etc.
<|endoftext|>Piggeries are hell on earth. Back when I was a linesman we had to do maintenance to some power lines that ran through the pig farm. The screams of the pigs were haunting. No normal person can work there and have a good time like ol mate pedoesta.
<|endoftext|>I am from this town and Ive never seen a pig farm in Toms River. I was born and raised there. Toms River is known for boating and access to the boardwalk in Seaside. Its not a cheap place to live and any acreage is likely protected land. I frequently visit there and I cant even imagine where these pigs might be. Please show me.Edit to add: The Long Tom River is in Oregon, not New Jersey. Toms River was once called Goose Creek.Edit 2:  I absolutely love a good conspiracy, but 25 years of my life were spent on the Barnegat Bay and there is nothing but expensive homes here. You will not find a farm in this area. You are needing to go west at least 30 mins before you hit any farm land.
<|endoftext|>Toms River is a huge suburb in NJ probably hasnt been any pig farms in the last 40 years at least.
<|endoftext|>That walnut sauce link might be someone innocently misinterpreting something, [this one is Podesta sharing the joke ](
<|endoftext|> "Walnut Sauce" is and has been for a long time codeword for Adrenochrome.And your evidence for this is?
<|endoftext|>There is an episode in season 2 of Gotham where they introduce Scarecrow. Dr. Crane is harvesting glands from people by torturing and scaring them to the point that their fear is at the max. As soon as I heard about adrenochrome I thought of this episode and the scene in Doctor Sleep where they are torturing Jacob Tremblays character. Going down the Stephen King trail I realized in IT, Pennywise thinks the children taste better than adults and taste best when they are scared, I feast on your flesh as I feed on your fear. Apparently The Outsider and other works of his have this theme of collecting fear/energy from tortured children
<|endoftext|>I have thought that EXACT SAME THING !!! She loved all children so much and at times it looked as if she was trying so hard to protect them..
<|endoftext|>Maybe, but the elite also like a good abortion too. They use aborted babies in many applications ranging from cuisines to the vaccines that are injected into our bodies
<|endoftext|>But the alleged perpetrators of the child sex abuse are overwhelming democrats/involved with the Democratic Party, so that makes no sense
<|endoftext|>I believe that video is from a group called Worldcorp Enterprises. Saw a couple of youtube videos about that group and that video was talked about.
<|endoftext|>Thats a good theory. If you take too long to kill livestock the meat is tainted due to the high stress of the animal affecting the blood in a way that makes it nearly inedible for humans. Adrenochrome definitely served a biological purpose and affected the course of evolution for the animals that produce it. You're asking the right questions.
<|endoftext|>Surely. It is used by children in times of duress to bolster the physiological abilities of the biological as well as mental systems of the children to escape from danger. I'm not sure if that's a good point to your comment or entirely unrelated it was just my initial thought.
<|endoftext|>Holy shit. You're right I just looked into it. Hunter S Thompson himself was so suspicious he wrote a piece on his disapearence called The Banshee Screams For Buffalo Meat. The attorney's name was Oscar Zeta Acosta
<|endoftext|>I only clicked on this post because I recognized the word from the book and wanted to see if anyone noticed how odd the connection is! Thank you for posting!
<|endoftext|>I keep thinking of all these movies and tv shows and music and it all kinda leads to the same place: adrenochrome. the movie Limitless comes to mind, American Horror Story's Hotel series is LITERALLY about a vampire who drinks the blood of children in California. RuPaul's song Adrenaline.
<|endoftext|>Woah Dr. Sleep is about adrenochrome? How so in your opinion? IS the original book by Stephen King based on adrenochrome? Is the shining?
<|endoftext|>its time to change it for the better. you can help raise awareness from the comforts of your home :)
<|endoftext|>or, heres a thought- adrenaline is a well-known compound associated with strength, and chrome is known as a material for being sleek. As for the logo, its a fucking circle.If there were some secret conspiracy to harvest some magic drug from infants (a chemical that, mind you, can also be made easily from epipens) then what possible reason could they have for hiding random signs like that?

I specifically was searching for some type of anti-aging symptoms.  the psychotic reactions the following symptoms were reported:Thought disorder(8)Bizarre ideation(1)Derealization(5)Depersonalization(1)Body image disturbances(2)Tactile hallucinations (2)Auditory hallucinations(1)Visual hallucinations (0)Minor visual illusions (3)Euphoria (5)Complete loss of insight(2)Adrenochrome destroys brain cells, as evidenced by structural changesSometimes the advantage improves the ability to survive a potentially deadly illness. The affected individual can then pass his/her genes to the next generation more efficiently than other people because they are more likely to reach reproductive age.

In all this discussion thread I haven't seen much about what the stuff does when its being normal - does it have any specific biochemical role?I'd like to know how it affects whatever the thing about the pineal is so special in eastern and other lore about the 3rd eye etc. I remember seeing a bunch of "pineapple" sculptures from many times and sources. Also is there any connection from AC to DMT...
<|endoftext|> [ This video will not prove that lady gaga eats babies. What it will do is show you all of the information available to the public about the cover ups of **satanic** pedophilia sex rings in the last 40 years. That part takes about 50 minutes. It will prove to you that (at least some of) the rich elite are participating in, and covering up these sex rings. Every source is shown and is accurate. If you find that any source is not accurate and don't want to put in the effort to confirm it's legitimacy, I can do that for you. After showing proof of these sex rings and they're cover ups, the poster then goes into some stuff about what you would call "weird images and song lyrics" and how they are connected to these sex rings. Take that as you will. Later, they go on to explain adrenochrome and the cannibalism aspect of the sex rings. I really am genuinely convinced that this is the truth. The elites are trafficking children and it's not just as simple as perversion. They do this because they believe it helps them obtain power. Don't take my word for it though. Do some research and find out just how bad this all really is.
<|endoftext|>Thats the way urls work. Look at literally any product on amazon. Its from parent and children elements in the html.
<|endoftext|>But what were the age of the girls? It is weird to compare since they are underage but at least to me personally there is a difference between someone who likes developing or developed teenage girls and pre-pubescent children. They are both pedophiles but to me Trump comes off as more of a sleazy pervert than a pedophile. Still disgusting though.
<|endoftext|>It seems kind of bogus and way too obvious to actually be happening. There are known pedophilia symbols that date back to at least the 90s early 2000s like the triangle with the inner triangle. These people are usually creative about hiding it and that seems way too in your face to be actually happening. The child name thing on the pieces of furniture is what made me tap out completely. Just too obvious.
<|endoftext|>Theres the wayfair gate Instagram which has a lot but I dont like Instagram that much so I stay here
<|endoftext|>Ha. That may be new to Americans, but people from 3rd world countries have experienced such hostility since time immemorial.
<|endoftext|>Wasn't Trump pictured with Epstein and his co trafficker as well? Its kind of weird that everyone who supports Trump ignores this fact
<|endoftext|>Also interesting how /r/conspiracy chose "human trafficking" as our round table literally days before the wayfair thing.
<|endoftext|>Wow, wtf Before today I had literally never heard of this. I only came on this sub reddit to see stuff about the wayfair trafficking. I don't even know what to do now. This is absolutely staggering I feel like I need to do something but have no idea what. If you've got any other info I'd be grateful to see it.
<|endoftext|>Been getting a lot of messages so here are the two most common vids Ive been sending to those that have messaged me:Isaac Kappy (B-list celebrity) live periscope of shadows of you may be even more shocked by the fact that Trump is the good guy, and the reason why every media source and celebrity supports the narrative that hes terrible is because hes trying to expose this corruption. Its sooo much to explain in one post but this video clears up the confusion about Trumps relationship with Epstein. Keep in mind Trumps speeches and signing of legislation addressing sex trafficking never get mainstream coverage (along with anything else that hes done well):  know the above point may stir some controversy but I have countless evidence that Ill gladly share to support the claim that Trump is trying to fight sex trafficking and corruption in general. In fact it was the DNC that purchased evidence from Russia to include in the Steele dossier which was used against trump during his two year investigation and ultimate impeachment. Its a verifiable fact that the claims against Trump were bogus and that members of the DNC even fabricated additional lies to include into the Steele Dossier. Seth Rich was a member of the DNC and 100% was the one who leaked the Wikileaks emails, NOT Russia. Seth Rich was killed about one week after leaking the emails. Hillarys campaign blamed it on Russia to diminish the credibility of the contents of the emails and begin the narrative that Russia was launching cyber attacks on the US when in fact it was the Obama and Clinton administrations that conspired with Russia to falsify evidence used to obtain a FISA warrant, ultimately granting them access to spy on the Trump campaign. This isnt speculation, Rod Rosenstein was in court as the protests were going on for falsifying evidence and manipulating the FISA courts to obtain the warrant. Bit of a sporadic explanation but go ahead and verify everything I just said. If a mainstream source is calling what Im saying a conspiracy theory, you may want to look into their political paper trail (IE warner entertainment owns CNN, warner donates huge $$ to Hillary and the DNC, and ex warner VPs have went on to work for the Clinton foundation).
<|endoftext|>Thank you so much for posting, Very very well done. More people ned to watch it and more people need to expose the truth.
<|endoftext|>goes completely off the rails somewhere after the nxivm stuff, up until the end; definitely needs edited down. But other than that pretty good stuff.
<|endoftext|>Been getting tons of messages a lot asking what videos to watch, in my other comment I linked out of shadows and an Isaac Kappy vid if youre interested in the pizzagate related stuff. Would also recommend plandemic and we need to talk about sandy hook on bitchute. None of these videos are perfect but theyre extremely interesting to me.If youre REALLY interested, Id make a burner twitter account and follow some of the top Q accounts. Thats the best way to keep up to date with this stuff. Also always use duckduckgo as your search engine if you ever want to try to dig for info. Google makes it very hard to find info that goes against the mainstream narrative.Feel free to reply to this with any questions, if you want video suggestions let me know what exactly you want to look into because this spans far beyond pizzagate
<|endoftext|>This leaves me hopeless. No matter how hard the people fight against this thing, there's always someone high enough up to cover the tracks. Fighting TPTB just seems like a death wish.
<|endoftext|>Who is this user who created this? I watched the video but underneath the video where the description is, it says Youtube jas experience a swrver issue and wont load
<|endoftext|>These videos always show undeniable evidence of a elite pedophile ring, but then they destroy all their credibility tip toeing around Trump, and then they divulge into all this Satanist stuff accusing every tom, dick, and harry, jumping to huge conclusions.
<|endoftext|>Tbh one thing this video gets completely wrong is associating "the all seeing eye" with the eye of Horus and the meaning behind it.  The eye of Horus is a side view of your brain and puts emphasis on the pineal gland. They are completely different. And mystery religions were in no way shape or form "satanic" whatsoever. I can't really get behind a documentary that presents misinformation on this level.
<|endoftext|>This video may have useful information, Im not sure. But this poster definitely has a weird agenda
<|endoftext|>I think Mouthy Buddha's video brings up different points. Both videos/video series are good to watch. :-)
<|endoftext|>Yeah man. I do work for various people who are all moving. Was talking to this one guys. He worked for Homeland Security, mainly in the Child abduction and porn section of it. Said he was moving because they had to pull em off a case and move him because he found a picture of his daughters in their gym leotards on some fuckers database
<|endoftext|>that's what I'm saying/realizing. I locked down my shit so hard, IG mainly, but am sick to think it was ever Public. What isn't provocative or tempting to many will be to the wrong people. I'm sick.
<|endoftext|>Me too man. Protect your well-being above all else. This shit goes infinitely deep, and most of it is fake too, meant to throw us off the path
<|endoftext|>if we assume hypothetically that the reason these people perform elaborate rituals and provoke extreme fear in their victims before killing them is because somehow *it works* in saturating the resulting adrenochrome with some kind of unknown, "supernatural/magical" property that is desirable enough to make all that worth it... then why would a lab-made, synthetic substitute that is readily available for anybody to purchase have the same effect?
<|endoftext|>You have walnut sauce between your ears. If you waste your time with this youre a gullible fool. That is all there is to it.
<|endoftext|>WOW! I never thought of that! I wonder if that's how they got into it? Could explain Jack The Ripper
<|endoftext|>The Catholic Church is the only institution pointed out when speaking of pedophilia.Yes the Catholic Church has been highly infiltrated by communists and Freemasons (thus Vatican II) being evidently the main target of the NWO crowd. The pedophile thing is one of the card they have used when hiding all the pedophilia going on elsewhere. It is the tree used to hide the forest.
<|endoftext|>Yes, I have a very bright, very depressed friend who suggested this to me in EDIT ~~early January~~ late March 2020. Specifically, that blood clotting issues resulting from COVID-19 would be worsened for persons who had been recent or long time (or possibly occasional?) users of AC. COVID-19 *IS* associated with extreme, abnormal blood clotting. It is a problem in that it causes such terrible thickening and over-clotting that even the filters on kidney dialysis machines get clogged up. I read about THAT in the Wall Street Journal! In the medical community, the concern has shifted from ventilator shortages to dialysis nursing and dialysis filter supply shortages. I can link you to all of this, as it is mainstream medical fact at this point.
<|endoftext|>Those 'shakes' don't just dissipate... they are the result of a neurological disorder brought upon by cannabalism
<|endoftext|>That isn't cannibal meat. It's chemical meat. You can find videos where they slice meat up and bond it back together. If you look at "grilled chicken", you can see the slices all bonded together and it tastes of a very salty brine to cover the bad flavor. I can spot it a mile away and won't eat it. Also, the salads at fast food places has anti freeze on it. People thought I was crazy when I said I could taste poison on the lettuce until they looked it up.
<|endoftext|>Jasun Horsely's YT channel and book "The Vice of Kings".its literally the largest longest-running pedo ring in existence and history
<|endoftext|>Not sure the relation of Bloody Mary to the idea that young blood makes old wealthy people rich. Thats been a trope for a long time & scientifcaly unproven; 
<|endoftext|>Yeah I was gonna bring up fluoride in water, but that also ties into EPA corruption which I can go on about forever. I also figured that the fluoride issue was well known by the people who frequently visit this sub. My biggest question is why isnt iodine deficiency immediately investigated with regards to depression and related cognitive disorders?
<|endoftext|>It's nothing that we don't all have access to in my opinion. The spiritual belief is about there being entities outside our scope or vision which are pleased when evil is committed. Killing kids appeases their God, the Satanic force. This force comes in all different alien-like forms. It is theorized that the Rockerfellers have spent so much on Alien-related media to make commonfolk subconsciously afraid of interacting with dark energies which Alister Crowley used to depict as alien-like.
<|endoftext|>Theoretically it's the highest reach of cannibalism, which is present in every aspect of our world. We must kill and eat other lifeforms in order to survive, and that plays out in the economy, psychology, etc. This is 'highest' form of cannibalism, or the lowest. Either way, if you see the world this way it's a natural progression of thought. If you think of sex in the same way as domination or power, the highest form of sexual satisfaction would be the highest contrast, between the 'self' and a victim, if sex is interpreted as usurpation of power. Makes you want to shoot yourself in the head though, more likely that would be the outcome before feeling any 'pleasure' from this or any other worldly pleasure, after this. At this point I hope everyone's understanding and appreciating the philosophy of the Amish.
<|endoftext|>Well, lets be real here. America is a new nation in historical terms. Natives lived here obviously, so what I am about to delve into might apply to US and it might not. Anyway, Europe has a deep history. When I think about the powerful monarchies, which were simply just a big powerful family ruling over the land of Europe, it honestly makes me feel like the roots of corruption run deep and possibly deeper than anyone can even imagine.Lets take a look. We can be certain of one thing. Sex has always been an aspect of humanity. Before things could even be commodified sex was a thing. It is probably the first form of a transaction for anything. Taking that into consideration, I bet children and women were sold into trafficking situations as soon as someone had power and realized they can benefit from doing this to a person. So that would mean this started as early as civilization. (Its possible native Americans engaged in these kind of things as well; but as far as Im concerned the highest political position was chief and you could marry your daughter but I dont know if they were trading people, as they didnt believe in ownership.) The nature of American freedom would definitely yield this kind of behavior more easily. But if youve kept track of anything within the pedo ring its been suggested that Prince Charles was involved, and this is the UK. So yeah, I would agree that America looks like a big offender but Europeans could just be so blindsided but the possible truth their history suggests. People were able to hold so much power in such a, for lack of a better description, primitive world. I bet blackmail was used, manipulation, torture, terror, ignorance, the like. All throughout until the 20th century when people started to wake up to it.
<|endoftext|>Right right, just like people don't need to hunt for food but plenty still do it for the tradition, comradery, and the ritual though
<|endoftext|>This is not a liberal / conservative thing. People really need to stop thinking that way. Look into the Franklin scandal;that was a Republican contingent
<|endoftext|>I get that look when I'm on adderall and I don't get enough sleep.I must be a super demon.Or you guy are having trouble articulating reality, and misusing fantasy to describe something real.
<|endoftext|>Thanks for explaining this. Wow... with your explanation and the fact it came up when I typed Pizzagate is... well... concerning....
<|endoftext|>OMG! Just looked up Jenny McCarthy Justin Bieber and the pictures came up and I'm baffled that I didn't hear about this at the time. It's absolutely disgusting. If their genders were reversed this might have gotten more backlash.
<|endoftext|>how about this... remember he sees basically dinosaurs or "lizard people" after he takes it when hes in the bar
<|endoftext|>Here's the script [ "Blood"[ to the conversation on the phone. It sounds like he's saying "They were after her pineal gland, I think"
<|endoftext|>Dude I don't understand all the context but I do see pornstars names in there. Sex and violence. Sounds their cup of tea.
<|endoftext|>Now that u say that the line in the canisters was red when filling...kinda like blood...and this comment made me think of how odd that is right its supposed to just be their screams filling it so why does it go red and not another color
<|endoftext|>Except for the part where taking the kids away from their homes was a bad thing and the entire conflict of the movie
<|endoftext|>I think he's talking for Epstein. "You never actually saw me die, did you? Conclusions can be so deceiving."
<|endoftext|>I dont think the people at the ground level know whats up: i think if my theory is correct its kinda like preying on good people who think they have good intentions. Convincing the masses that its murder so the babies get handed to these organizations, all the while the people making the adoption choices think they are making the best decision for their baby. Its just a thought, the world is in such shambles right now my mind goes to dark places. I just spent the last week in the Midwest (first time ever, Im from New England) and the amount of people I met in Wisconsin who think that way out there is scary but they dont seem like bad people. They think they are doing the right thing
<|endoftext|>I really dont think theres left or right, I think its Us vs them. I just think the way they puppeteer the right side *could* include include orphanage corruption
<|endoftext|>Ill have to read that piece, I missed that. Its so strange. Oscar just randomly went missing? It doesnt sit right with me and never has really.
<|endoftext|>Im glad I wasnt the only one! As soon as I read the post the first thing I thought of was the book too.
<|endoftext|>yes! im not sure about the shining, but dr sleep for sure. A group of evil millennial demigods , harvesting the essence of children into bottles so they can remain youthful and get high. them also getting extra essence by torturing and scaring the children sounds a lot like the adrenochrome narrative. That scene with the little boy is the definition of it, the only difference is that instead of magic they use needles to extract it.
<|endoftext|>then what possible reason could they have for hiding random signs like that?Honest question: have you done any research into the occult?Those practicing occult rituals *very much believe* that part of their power is derived *specifically* from hiding symbols in plain sight.I'm not saying that's *for sure* what's happening here, but that would be the obvious reason why.
<|endoftext|>Adreno is literally just an anagram of RadeonSo is "Endora"...ever watch "Bewitched" (Samantha's mom, heh)?In all seriousness, I *do* see it mentioned in that article that adreno is an anagram of radeon, but when I click the *source* listed at the end of the sentence, it takes me to a page with *no* mention of the words "anagram and radeon."I'm not doubting that this is indeed the origin of the term, but do you have an actual source instead of a throwaway comment on a wikipedia article? It would be really helpful in dismissing this particular "connection". Thanks in advance!
<|endoftext|>I have trouble with the Alex Jones one. I would completely believe Icke because that guy is a fuckin loon. I think if anything Alex is just a crazy alcoholic who used to do pretty good investigative revelations who fell off and got deplatformed.
<|endoftext|>I'm not sure. You can send them an email and inquire about that on most of the websites above. I don't believe it's much though.Edit; your typical epipen supposedly contains about 1mg of epinephrine which is a similar compound to adrenochrome so that may be a helpful comparison of you want to visualize it. 
<|endoftext|>Speaking of Mothers milk, its these blood suckers that say I cant sell my breast milk from my body online legally ! Why?
<|endoftext|>He is referring to Maxwell, it was just worded slightly confusingly. I think its possible but there is no way this could distract from real information coming out on Maxwells end. The second a name drops from her it is going to be everywhere but I am extremely doubtful we will ever hear one. Or see her again.
<|endoftext|>Just that they allow you to see the structure and fabric of reality differently. I say different, but all the differences we experience, derive from , and are contained within the same space.All these different realities, being experienced by different extensions of the same consciousness.GOD brain, GOD mind. Christlike consciousness.Edit: I dunno if I answered anything you were asking lol, but it felt right to type lol.
<|endoftext|>Are there any articles that discuss this? I hate videos but will watch if there is no reading material
<|endoftext|>You never know... my mom always searched my room for contraband... so I hid my weed and playboys in plain sight... my weed in her poupori bowl in the living room and my playboys in my little brothers shelf of old coloring books... she never found either stashes
<|endoftext|>It's also well known that Trump barred them from Mar-A-Lago decades ago. Everyone who hates Trump ignore this...
<|endoftext|>I never said he was innocent. I just feel something like this would feed his ego resulting in him going after the pedo ring. Who knows anymore, just a thought. So much going on behind the scenes we have no idea about.
<|endoftext|>The sex trafficking conspiracy came from reddit. So just for the sake of satisfying pleasure in madness this subreddit will go out of its way to tarnish a companies reputation with very little evidence to provide. Everything that is provided are suggestions, but there is no real proof. And why? Just so you can have something to hold on during the corona madness?
<|endoftext|>No I actually saw shit on twitter that I realized originated from this hole of unemployment and figured Id stop by.If you guys found out that Tim Cook and Ghislaine Maxwells dogs ate the same dog food, you fucking numbskulls would thing that Purina is running a child sex ring. Fucking evaluate your battles, morons. Not every single incidence in the living breathing fucking world is a sign of a satanic pedophillic global sex ring. I mean just listen to how fucking stupid that sounds.Thats all from me mates
<|endoftext|>Just take some time working your way through all this info dude, I first got introduced 11 years ago when I watched Zeitgeist, I started studying Journalism in college the year after and got sucked into a massive rabbit hole, yet after years of knowing about this level of corruption PedoGate and Out of Shadows really threw me for a loop. A few days off the phone, spending time with friends or nature is great before coming back to all this info again. Welcome to the Red Pill Club 
<|endoftext|>What-why-no feel free to message me. I was freaking out when I found out too and definitely have more videos/can provide some info
<|endoftext|>Same - I have jumped into a few rabbit holes and then I just have to take a break. And Wayfair pulled me back in also. I've heard about Pg8 but I didn't really know. There's a few good videos out there. I'm adding this one to my watchlist..it's hard to absorb but must at least be looked into and considered.
<|endoftext|>What you should do is check other websites and verify the sources. The world is full of gullible people who believe crazy batshit conspiracies at face value. It would literally take about 5 minutes of research to get the truth.
<|endoftext|>We need to spread good info, put aside our politics and figure out a way to not just expose but put an end to this. It would mean assembling a global militia full of people willing to die or face ruination if we really want to put a stop to it. Take a page from Antifa's playbook and decentralize, remain anonymous and find ways to communicate secretly. It would require organization and sacrifice that I'm afraid most are still unwilling to commit to.
<|endoftext|>Im in the same boat. Just recently started really researching this stuff. Now Im paranoid that if I look too deep the Deep State will plant CP on my devices. I wish there was a way I could help catch these people.
<|endoftext|>Yeah, when I first started uncovering all of this, I was having serious chest pains. Like, I never, ever had chest pains in my life. Waking up panicking, the works. I agree that you'll need to take breaks and get outside...nature is very important to balance all of this out. It's insane. Watch, Out of Shadows.
<|endoftext|>[ think you need to see this
<|endoftext|>I have a friend that is indirectly shaming me on Facebook for reading this stuff and being on Reddit my response is at least the thought of shoving kids in cabinets and shipping them has grabbed the attention of people who would otherwise have no interest in it. I see people here trying to figure out what they can do to help bring it to light to stop it. Bantering on here brings ideas. Ideas get put into action and the result can ultimately help.
<|endoftext|>Welcome bro!!!! Youve been red pilled. Each piece of that documentary could be its own, so keep digging. Check out truthcat 30 min & Corbett report documentaries sorted by popular to get brought up to speed
<|endoftext|>Trump is the good guyIf he wanted to expose it, all he has to do is EXPOSE IT. HAVENT SEEN HIM DO THAT YET.If you want people to believe you, dont play into the dem/rep game.
<|endoftext|>Where your wrong is that Trump is a good guy the clintons went to his wedding. Epstein was his buddy down in Florida. The media hates trump for other reasons but he is definitely NOT the good guy this is what Q theory gets completely wrong. Nobody would be allowed to become the president if they arent playing ball. Trump is used as a way to further drive the division of the country and perpetuate us into insanity. We are entering a new era of Techno Facism.Also, this whole idea that the Christian church is somehow the answer is absolutely horseshit. Do we forget about the Vaticans coverup of pedophillia! Not every facet of the occult is inherently evil either. Occult literally means hidden. Plenty of people who practice esoteric philosophy who only want to end the corruption and evil in the world.
<|endoftext|>I believe Trump is the good guy, saw one thing that every president ever was a part of the same heritage from way back and Trump is the first one not a part of it....
<|endoftext|>How do I know she isn't just some extreme crazy Trump supporter? I'd like to believe it, and I somewhat do believe Trump isn't involved with all this mess and in someway maybe trying to end it all and expose it and that's why he ran for president. But its also easy to fabricate both sides of the story. &#x200B;How did she read the flight logs? How does she know Epstein was banned from his nightclub?
<|endoftext|>How do you explain Trump's-Epstein connection? His donations to the Clinton Foundation? His outward misogyny? Trump is a puppet of the same people. He is as much a pedophile, racist, terrorist, globalist as the rest of them, he's just a great actor.
<|endoftext|>Long post. I would say TL;DR but I skimmed.I believe there are sources to your claims that will prove what you say but I for one cannot accept a published claim without sourcing via humans. I see you have a clearing up Potus and KeystoneEpstein vid. Russia connection last campaign, is/was that cleared up? Thoroughly?Do doubt the whole Warner and CNN and D's Nd all that is in some way if not all provable.Warner that's Entertainment production and distribution yes?Some say that Hollywood was built from scratch for its purpose.Some say the same thing with Silicone Valley.Some say that Entertainment creation and distribution is the way of the cyber world.Some say that the earth is flat or hollow, that masks will suffocate you and the virus is both fake and deadly at same time.Some say that recent tests being pushed by White House which saw obvs increases in deaths and infected were so the drop in figures will seem more dramatic when it happens in coming weeks.I get the ProTrump and Neg Dems as it makes sense. That Trump is the saviour of the human race and as such should be worshiped, I disagree with..I find people either seem hystericaly overconfident and regurgitate rhetoric or they are just agreeing as necessary.Obvs you have the neg camp and their conflicting diss and opinions.If you were to tell me a year ago that Trump was working for secret resistance or spy group to overthrow a group of Elites that drink kids blood and worship devil and smuggle children and basically run the world.That Trump and His shadow operatives were systematically wiping out or imprisoning high value celebs and Elite and they needed civilians to help?If you were to tell me that a year ago I would have said "Your Insane, Get Away, I Own A Firearm."Now if you were to tell me same today I would say "Sweet Bro, Trump Win?, Unity ye, I Own A Firearm:Where's ANTIFA?" Or something like that. So The Influence is strong in the Social media echo chambers. It can grip most GenPop and higher percentage of Fringe/Sub society. Sheep.Sheeple.Wolf.PuppetMaster.iTL;DR: This post is rather word heavy and I disclaim now that I won't be held responsible for anyone who should fall asleep or drift off during assimilation of its contents. I leave each and every one of you to read this fully before making a comment.Hipocritical of Me as Too Long Didn...zzzz
<|endoftext|>WHAT IF all this just came out of his press office? You know, he just got a vote, from you, based on a weird conspiracy theory that also was already used years ago in pizzagate
<|endoftext|>Im glad Trump is good in your eyes and yes I agree him exposing the corruption and the sex trafficking is good.but this is still the same man whos putting kids in cages just because they werent born in America that doesnt seem good at all I see no reason to even doing that were all humans livin on one planet we all die at the end and thats it
<|endoftext|>I would love to see this evidence. I agree with you but probably dont have as much evidence as you do.
<|endoftext|>Side-bar: anyone else notice the homophonic irony between 'Is_sac [ i's-a-sic-puppy ] Ka_ppy'? (purposeful misspells)
<|endoftext|>Do you not find it strange that celebrities tend to strike this same pose? How many average Joe's cover one eye for a photo?
<|endoftext|>You say to make a burner account. And hide your trail...But how would we make it the norm to voice opposition to these things?Where you dont have to worry about your friends, family, and job knowing that you believe in Q, support Trump, or believe other conspiracies?Until theres a new normal that involves questioning the MSM narrative, they will continue to get away with it all.
<|endoftext|>Would also recommend this video... whether or not you end up believing that Michelle is a man/Barack is gay, the evidence is pretty compelling [The First Gay President and His Husband](
<|endoftext|>IMO, learning about media manipulation and then pizza gate before anything else is a precursor to even more interesting discoveries
<|endoftext|>Trump is trying to help. Has always been passionate about stopping sex trafficking. Thats why the media, Hollywood, etc, slams him 24/7. Hes the biggest threat theyve ever faced. The rape cases against him were paid for by a DNC lawyer. Russia investigation ironically shouldve been investigating the DNC, not Trump. Constantly taken out of context in slandered, and MSM tries to create an association between trump and Epstein when in reality the only relationship Trump has had with Epstein in the past 20-25 years is contributing to cases trying to lock him up. He played buddy buddy with them, obviously, so to not blow his cover. If anyone is doubting this let me know... I firmly believe the two most important things you can do are 1) spread awareness 2) vote for Trump in November. This isnt a political ad, and if you look into it Trump has done more in one year to combat sex trafficking than Obama and Bush did combined.
<|endoftext|>The more Ive learned the more hopeful I feel. Just this week one of the largest online CP/trafficking operations was busted in Germany. The number of high profile arrests and the percentage of the general public that knows about this has been growing exponentially. Whether you like him or not, whether you think its to cover his own ass or not, Trump has been dominating the issue of sex trafficking since taking office. This is an issue hes talked about a lot before his presidency and hes attacked it like a hungry wolf since taking office
<|endoftext|>There 100% are satanic rituals that take place among the elite. I agree that a lot of the info included in these types of videos is pure speculation, but that doesnt discount whats been proven
<|endoftext|>Mystery religions are most and for sure satanic. Look up the history of every religion...or any that interest you. And try a different search engine than google. All roads lead to rome...today and in the past. Rome and Canin have been the root of most of these religions and who did they worship...gods...all kinds and the biggest one...demanded that every first born baby of a family be thrown in the fire for the god;s sacrifice.
<|endoftext|>Because YouTube is owned by google and google suppresses the shit out of anything related to government corruption
<|endoftext|>I'm confused what's bad about having photos public? My mom has things of my sisters public and no harm is done but I can see the reluctance of your side just dont get how it's a potential threat if any
<|endoftext|>Whats with all the antisemitism in the comments of the bitchute video? I feel it discredits the points in the video.
<|endoftext|>Can someone explain the connection at the end of pt. II with the balamut and demonic looking people? I kinda lost the connection on that one.Edit: spelling
<|endoftext|>So there's a CP problem with Yandex and someone spray painted a keyword on the road somewhere which Tom Hanks took a pic of. The idea that he then uses this to suggest Tom Hanks is a pedo is a huge stretch for me. I just don't see it. Also, SRC USA seems to have been cleaned up. Nothing but American military shows up. Appearantly src got raided by seal team 6
<|endoftext|>Liz Crokin Actually has her own webpage with it on there. Anyone who hasnt seen this = its a MUST SEE. Well worth your time 
<|endoftext|>If we're speaking hypothetically, typically organized crime families will force members into committing a crime like murder in order to own their secrecy and loyalty to the organization. It may not be for any purpose other than to give everyone blackmail material on each other should they want to leave at any point.They DO exist. They even have rituals associated with their joining the organization--pin pricks or tattoos associated with specific words. Whether or not the members of these organizations believe in a god/gods they still go through the ritual. It's 2020 and people who join the Russian mafia still say the words and do a blood ritual of some kind.The skeptics of "secret societies" or meetings like Bohemian Grove overlook the fact that most of these people at some point have made a decision they knew would take the life of multiple innocents--either drones, wars, GMOs, dams, etc and did the numbers of money to life and chose money. They are murderers. The mob boss who orders the hit is as guilty as the guy who does it because he knows his order will result in death.It's why they convicted Charles Manson but George Bush and Dick Cheney still have people who defend them--Barak, too.They are murders. We only refuse to call them that because then it means we voted for them and played a part in that ritual.
<|endoftext|>I don't know much about the supernatural aspect of it, but chemically it should be identical to the stuff in blood and should affect your body in the same way.I do agree with you though, if the cruelty of it is what adrenochrome users use it for than its entirely possible that synthetic stuff just wouldn't do it for them, I gotta say id lean more towards the reasons being for some sadistic sort of gratification over magic though . But anything's possible.
<|endoftext|>Do not forget there are other variables at play like, adrenaline and other chemicals being given off in the perpetrators brain because they are getting off on what they are doing so they have their own brain cocktail going off, then supposedly consume some fresh. I would believe that gives a stronger, compounding effect. But it is all speculation at this point. Just one side note, as a grower of my own fresh produce, food grown naturally in the sun, organically, taken while it is tender and delicate at times that are not available in stores is delicious and in almost any case better than something made unnaturally or in a green house or in a controlled circumstance. There is also a ton of possible inconsistencies in the end product from lab to lab that produces it, just like our prescription drugs. One factory may make the same drug under a different name but it could be slightly different than the name brand version, for better or worse.
<|endoftext|>If you are taking the real thing in the moment as the ritual is occurring the hormones and chemicals present in your body mix differently with the adrenochrome and give off the desired effect. Taking a synthetic copy while lounging in your house will produce little to no effect. It needs to be mixed with your proper chemicals.
<|endoftext|>I've forgotten where I read it, but there was/is an article floating around somewhere about the Mexican cartels that go absolutely crazy with the power they derive from people's fear. The article included a video of a female cartel drinking from a puddle of blood on the ground and explaining how drinking the blood of a terrified person gives her power. Crazy fucking shit. Not even ISIS is this utterly insane. I do believe it is the savage Aztec genes.
<|endoftext|>Youve been watching too many movies. lol. Any evidence of any of this? No. So why believe such nonsense?
<|endoftext|>Thanks for your input, yeah I guess I do don't I? But not in the resentful, pejorative sense you mean.Nice one.
<|endoftext|> early January 2020 blood clotting issues resulting from COVID-19Where was this person working or getting their info that they were so well informed of clotting issues when most people didn't think it would even escape China?
<|endoftext|>I am EXTREMELY interested in this information. I feel it is important to my tribe. I'm Native American and large amount of my tribesmen are on dialysis. I feel presenting such evidence could inspire my tribe to be more proactive in it's covid 19 efforts. thank you!
<|endoftext|>the owner stated he had a basement 5 years ago in an articleon live tv Clinton never denied the emails and she and the host lied saying there is no basementbut i don't think the basement even matterswhat matters is she did not deny the emails, just stated they were boring
<|endoftext|> Nobody ever made that argument.Maybe not specifically that Hillary Clinton was running it, but the claim was definitely made that children were being held in a basement under Comet Ping Pong and were being trafficked through secret tunnels and the sewers to "elite" in Washington and it was all being run by the Democrats. That was not made up by Reuters.
<|endoftext|>If anything related to Pizzagate were true, then why isn't Barr investigating it? Why isn't Trump tweeting about it? That would be HUGE. Especially now, he could really use a distraction.I just don't get the disconnect between die-hard keyboard investigators with, supposedly, mountains of evidence, and the fact that Trump and Barr are doing nothing about it.Also, why don't you think that Barr (a lifelong politician and part of the Washington elite) and Trump (a tv star and part of the elite) are part of it?
<|endoftext|>I'd say money, but most people who are genuinely sick cannot/do not seek treatment. Perhaps the small percentage that does seek treatment pulls in enough for them to be satisfied. Still somebody could privately investigate the situation, just out of curiosity. On the flip side, I know I need iodine, I know where to get it. I can keep myself healthy. Everyone can do that. A healthy diet would be the result of such an investigation, if true. Why not just have a healthy diet to begin with.
<|endoftext|>Because they want to say they have something wrong with their serotonin and that they are crazy so that they can silence people
<|endoftext|>I didn't know P. Diddy wrote a book called "The Adrenochrome Witch." It's a real-life Hollywood story...
<|endoftext|>The almost instinctive perpetuation of abuse/trauama and how widespread it is always made me think it's something deeply/fundamentally ingrained. Maybe as we evolved we picked up on the possibility of conditioning others through fear, since it's so intuitive.
<|endoftext|>Both I guess, but the joke wasnt on you at all. Google is pinning Rothschild Island as the entire continent, that does concern me.
<|endoftext|>No problem. I discovered the video's strange vibes around 2 weeks ago and it gets deeper and deeper. It turns out the cat in the video (for some reason) represents MK Ultra, leaving some to believe Justin was a victim of this. Note at the end of the video is the plate with Justin's young face on it captioned 'Yummy'. His Instagram at the time was used to promote this video with pictures of babies, lots of them, and the wording 'Yummy' written in gewy-looking pizza letters. His page was looking like Jimmy Comet's for a little while.
<|endoftext|>Hunter S. Thompson was always very vocal about wanting to commit suicide, he wanted to go out on his terms and made a spectacle out of it.
<|endoftext|>No that was acid. Adrenochrome was when his lawyer turned into an 8 titted monster. Then the next morning....
<|endoftext|>And when he's checking at the hotel there's one dude on the background talking on the phone about busting some satanic pedo and getting it
<|endoftext|>and at the end they discovered laughter is more powerful than scream/fear, so take from that what you will.
<|endoftext|>No the movie isn''t pro trafficking obviously. But I wonder if it was an easter egg. Maybe the creators knew and just didn't feel safe addressing the issue outside of a disguised kid's film
<|endoftext|>Well then you have to consider this - what is the use of facilitating the underage molestation to trick an unsuspecting politician or celebrity into performing an act that can be used to blackmail them for political or even criminal (in regards to effecting policies, regulations or investigations into the criminal activity) acts if they in fact do it to someone with fundamentally different ideologies? It doesn't make a lot of sense for one side to surreptitiously appropriate a Senator to one's side if they are fundamentally opposed you as the deception would be noticeable and negate the entire operation possibly even make light of the wrongdoings of the blackmailer and the intended target.
<|endoftext|>Well his last contact was made with his son, where he said he was getting on a boat of snow so like, of all people to track down and find out what actually happened to them, this guy is probably gonna be near impossible to actually figure out. There IS a good chance he just ODd or got killed by someone due to events not pertaining to adrenochrome at all.
<|endoftext|>Except that that makes literally zero sense whatsoever, and anyone smart enough to keep a conspiracy secret would realize that.Also, again: you can literally make adrenochrome out of EpiPens.
<|endoftext|>I can't find an original source for that, so I'll have to concede that point and assume it's pure coincidence that they're anagrams.That said, Adreno still has zero to do with Google beyond being able to run Google code, if we're going to that then Radeon is an anagram of Adreno and you can also run Chrome on Radeon GPUs, maybe we should investigate AMD too...Basically, it's not really a direct or important tie and the kinda thing that just adds to the "paranoid nutjob" stereotype surrounding these kinda communities rather than make people go "oh wait what the hell, there is something going on."
<|endoftext|>Yeah, if you listen to him when he was on public access in Austin you will see that the man said and did some things just about everyone would applaud but he is a black mark now and will only earn you ridicule to talk about.
<|endoftext|>The head of every branch of government in seemingly in on this conspiracy man, so its true that we may never get true justice.
<|endoftext|>There definitely are but the video I sent basically compiles what would take days of research into one video. Here is one interesting article found within the video:  is the FBI Vaults report on the Finders: vault.fbi.gov/the-finders/the-findersThe finders was a cult of satanic pedophiles that was originally arrested in the late 80s and is the first lead we have chronologically. In the report it details proof of pedophilia, child porn, satanic ritual practices, and global child sex trafficking. The group was later dismissed of all charges even after definitively stating that they had in fact done such crimes. This FBI report was not made public until 2019. This is the first case we can point to in American History where a perverted, pedophilic, satanic, ritualistic cult was protected and covered up by our government, but there are so, so many more cases. If you want to know the truth, watch the video, and then double check every source/article/document that is brought up. If you do find the truth, whatever it may be, please do your best to share it with the world.
<|endoftext|>My ex used to keep her weed in her purse with hippie potpourri, perfume and many other smells. Her weed tasted like crap, gave you a headache and just made you angry instead of buzzed.I hope yours didn't taste that bad.
<|endoftext|>Why would he have done that? Don't say because he knew. Because if he knew and he didn't report pedo island, then he is just as guilty.. so where exactly are u going with this statement
<|endoftext|>Dude if you genuinely just think this a random conspiracy theory strung from thin air watch this video: [ The first 50 minutes are only going over the public knowledge of **satanic** pedophile sex rings in the last 40 years. We have the proof that this happened 30 years ago and we have serious reason to believe that it is still happening now. There are uninformed people claiming that all of this is true, and there are uninformed people claiming all of this is fake. Inform yourself and then decide which bucket you land in.
<|endoftext|>Can you send all your videos to me too, and Ill do the same, we will both learn off each other bro
<|endoftext|>Man this is so true, its infuriating how some people will look and look and eventually do some mental gymnastics to corroborate their ideals/agenda. Its here in plain sight buddy, if trump was a good guy it wouldnt be up for debate. :simple:
<|endoftext|>He's playing chess, not checkers. And he can't take down any of these high profile ppl until after the election. Not saying he's a good person. I believe he is quite bigoted and reckless. Especially on twitter. But he is the ONLY person going against the deep state. Do your own research and YOU decide. I consider myself an independent. I dont identify with a political party bc I don't believe in that. I will be voting Trump because if Biden gets elected, kiss your freedoms goodbye. Biden will be a pawn for the radical left agenda.
<|endoftext|>So because Trump doesnt come out and Say hey I got this guy and that guy? Look around dude. Epstein and Maxwell have been knowingly doing this for a long time. Why were they never investigated or prosecuted? Since Trump took office, Weinstein, Epstein, Maxwell, Spacey, man child trafficking rings are being taken down, wins over MS -13, legislation all geared towards human trafficking. Hillary will be in Jail. You are seeing only what the media wants you to see. 10 days after Trump fires the NY District attorney, (Im sure the MSM found another reason why he fired him) Maxwell is arrested. Ironically enough thats the same office that holds the Clinton emails and Ukraine cases. Non movement because it favors the President. We as Americans are the victims of this battle of good vs evil. Our TELL A VISION have PROGRAMMED us to believe what they want. Once you take the red pill youll see things clearly.P.S does anyone think Trump taking down a Clinton and Bushs portrait has anything to do with them coming down? #epstein
<|endoftext|>Trump is not the Epstein flight logs, and he also kicked out Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago resort for sexually harassing a minor.Also, please don't consider the "CHRISTian" church part of the vatican. The vatican and catholic beliefs in general go against what JESUS taught, and therefore should not be considered "CHRISTian" even if they label themselves so.Read the actual words of JESUS in a kjv BIBLE and you will see how evem HE Spoke against pharisees (considered religious leaders of the day) and called them vipers and "blind leading the blind".
<|endoftext|>This  theres already plenty of reports of abuse and negligence happening in those immigration camps, I cant wait to hear the truth behind whats really happening, when it comes out of the mouth of some politician, in couple of years.. So that he can push his agenda,(be the good guy) while gathering up support.
<|endoftext|>When I saw it in the video I thought "what the hell everybody does that" but afterwards I did it myself and realized just how unnatural and counter intuitive it is. Noone does it, you just see it everywhere because of the media
<|endoftext|>I love that you include support trump in this shit. You are a brainwashed slave. Good luck ever making it. I look at your other posts and you are just a huge victim. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. If you have shit beliefs people will treat you shitty. Maybeeee dont follow the worst president we have ever had and maybeee you will stop being a pathetic asshat
<|endoftext|>Talk to your parents / child's grandparents too. I need my mom to be sure she knows all her friends and nothing is public and in the wrong hands.
<|endoftext|>Look at all the search results. All the pictures of children and minors that are downloaded and spread to perverts. Anyone can gain access to them. Learn their names, see their location, approach them by name and claim they know them based on all the public information shared. Any swim suit picture or anything we see as innocent, others may not.
<|endoftext|>That's just bitchute in general. They dont really ban or remove anything, so all of the people who left YouTube for being too edgy end up concentrated there.
<|endoftext|>Unfortunately a lot of people have been purposely misled and are confused.This might explain where some of the confusion stems from:
<|endoftext|> I just don't see it. [You see what you want to see]( you should dig a little deeper into Hanx and his Instagram posts?I don't know
<|endoftext|> The mob boss who orders the hit is as guilty as the guy who does it because he knows his order will result in death.NO.. Order followers are ALWAYS more culpable the order givers. Without order followers, the givers would be powerless.
<|endoftext|>Holy water would be another example. Chemically, structurally identical to good old H2O, but to hardcore Christians is so much moreAs they say, we create our own reality. Maybe the simple act of truly 100% believing that performing ritualistic blood sacrifices to Moloch earns you good fortune/health actually manifests that outcome in (your) reality. You can take a placebo effect approach to that question or a quantum physics one, I think. Like, maybe we're just oblivious prisoners in the elites' constructed version of reality until we ourselves make the "hop" to an alternate "bubble" of reality in which they no longer rule us. Maybe that's even what's happening right now in slo-mo as more people discover the adrenochrome conspiracy and give weight to it, think meme magick or the "age of awakening". Or maybe a demiurge/matrix architect/alien overlord literally does exist and they worship it because it actually, tangibly benefits them, I don't know. I find the more I investigate "reality", the less I actually know. Maybe I need to wait for the Existential Confusion + Nature of Reality Round Table thread. Sidenote this topic often reminds me of the HBO show True Blood, I only watched the first season or two and was pretty shit but it had an ancient race of vampires go mainstream in the public eye, turns out they have infiltrated the highest levels of power around the world etc etc... The UN has made a synthetic, identical blood substitute "TruBlood" to feed the vampires and reduce vamp-on-human violence. But they dont want it, it tastes like shit and doesnt hit the spot right..
<|endoftext|>The nature of reality is such, that actually, no, anything is not possible. And extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, or they should be summarily dismissed as the nonsense they are.   "Ardenachrome". You wanna know what that would feel like? Drink two cans of Red Bull while on an empty stomach.
<|endoftext|>I'm sorry about the date. I was wrong. I checked. We talked about this in late March 2020, around March 26th, I believe.
<|endoftext|>Alefantis stated in a magazine article that they stored tomato sauce in their basement but he never said it was at Comet Ping Pong. It was actually the basement at Buck's, so he wasn't lying. And what emails do you think Hillary Clinton needed to deny? It was Podesta's emails that were being cited, not hers.
<|endoftext|>I agree, it is likely an ingrained thing. I wonder if its fear or intimidation based though. I get the impression intimidation is used to get victims to do what they want. And it translates to fear
<|endoftext|>What about skydiving or swimming with sharks, or driving fast cars.  None of these things are necessary but people do it for the risk.
<|endoftext|>Tbh I remember Pizzagate from years ago... but silly me forgot all about it because the world is good at getting us to forget. Now Im seeing it explode again, and this time more people are talking about it (which is a good thing). Ive fell into a deep rabbit hole for hours over this topic, and well Im sick to my stomach about it all and I pray this will end soon.
<|endoftext|>youre right... damn so the Bar scene is before the Lizard people in the bar correct? Oh well it was a nice attempt i suppose
<|endoftext|>Yeah if you read it he talks about forwarding that email to his father, then his father talking about how they were hopeful the meds were working...
<|endoftext|>they don't want to ask anyone, they just want to come to the internet because real life isn't magic enough for them.Too many disney movies as children is the real adrenochrome
<|endoftext|>Yeah, youre right. I just thought of that connection earlier today and it was just odd to me. I wouldnt be shocked if he ODed at all. I read somewhere he was probably dumped in the ocean.
<|endoftext|>You can made synthetic cannabis too, but no one on the planet wants it because it simply just isn't the same.Have you *considered* the possibility that the same is true for adrenochrome?Take a metaphysical approach for once.
<|endoftext|>tbh I personally find the adreno/chrome/google thing fairly tenuous, and I'm a numerology/symbology junkie.The radeon/adreno explanation *does* make sense, but it certainly is curious that Wikipedia states this without a proper citation (that I could find).If anything, since Chrome was named 2nd (right?), it would be *that* decision that would be more suspect than anything, since it would've been an "answer" to the use of adreno (after the fact).Again, I wouldn't put it past the folks at google, but it's not something I will vociferously defend.However, the white rabbit in the chemical symbol is weird af, as well as the "Wuhan" connection.
<|endoftext|>Its pretty obvious that hes not going to have a photo of someone incriminating. Info is info. Its up to the listener to investigate the claims. If he says James Guun is a pedo and I find out JG made pedo comments, then Ill elevate JGs status as from possible to likely a pedo. Which warrants further investigation. Pretty simple really.
<|endoftext|>So were just going to let tens of thousands of children get tortured, raped, and murdered because theres no evidence. Theres a reason theres no evidence. These pedophiles arent your creepy neighbor down the block who drives his van with blacked out windows around. These are wealthy wealthy people with many connections who can make SURE there is no HARD evidence. I knew people and their severe cognitive dissonance would have their mind lead down this path, but I assure you if you express an ounce of critical thinking that this should be investigated extremely mother fucking thoroughly. The fact that evidence can be hidden and suppressed (which idk why you cant even ponder that as a possibility) destroys any benefit of doubt. Im not taking any chances here. Theres children involved and a parent myself, I couldnt be any more infuriated. Theres no fucking around here. None.
<|endoftext|>But cant it be regulated through a system? Like I can go to a doctor, provide documentation proving free of disease, drugs, etc and sell through a regulated system right? Some have approached me to buy my milk online because despite all of my children being passed milk age, I still produce due to a hormone. So I am just leaking for 0 reason.... what to do what to do!
<|endoftext|>Do you know if there is anymore information around the Walnut Creek incident? They keep reporting that they caught a large ring but all the reports only mention the dentist as being the only one arrested and that story is super fucking creepy. How did this guy get access to some of these spying devices? And why was he allowed to travel out of the country after being caught attempting to traffic children? Better yet, why the hell did he come back to get arrested? None of it makes sense
<|endoftext|>Back then it was Mexican brick weed Reggie so it was bound to give you a head ache... Definitely shit compared to whats available today
<|endoftext|>I'm pointing out that you are trying to lump Trump in with Epstein from DECADES ago. And, yes, I bet he definitely suspected something about Epstein but didn't have direct evidence.
<|endoftext|> this one is a little corny at parts and doesnt cover everything, but its a good intro into how are media landscape became what it is today. Again feel free to DM me, my friends and I have known about this since 2017
<|endoftext|>This one is very important. If you're looking for the unseen, this one just might break your mind. It's terrifying.
<|endoftext|>Here are some tough pills to swallow:-Trump is the good guy-So is Roger Stone-It was Hillary and Obama that conspired with Russia, not Trump-Michelle Obama could very well be a man-Barack is homosexual-Obamas kids are most likely adopted-Hamas is the terror group involved in trafficking and have infiltrated the US government-A large percentage of the recent rioting/looting/Marxist-themed protests were organized and paid for by the DNC-COVID has a lower death rate than the flu-COVID has turned into a political/monetary chess piece-BLM (the organization) was founded by Marxists, paid protestors to further its agenda, and gives all donations to the DNC-Google, Facebook, and Twitter censor anything that pertains to corruption-99% of the sources most people trust for their news have ties to Homas, China, elite politicians implicated in pedophilia, or most commonly all 3-The big names running this shitshow have been in power since your great great great great great great great great grandparents were aliveWelcome to the right side of history
<|endoftext|>If you think Trump is such a great guy, please explain his behavior back when he was doing the pageants. He walked in to the dressing rooms of not only Teen Miss USA, but Miss USA & Miss Universe, MANY of the girls complained not only of being seen nude, semi-nude, but being grabbed, groped & kissed...1 time may be an accident , but this was habitual. The Teens were as young as 15. He talked about this later on the Howard Stern show & said basically because he owned the pageant, he was allowed. Just because he pointed his finger in someone else's direction when Epstein 's victims lawyer came calling, doesnt make him innocent.
<|endoftext|>Yeah the Southern District threw a case together against Maxwell in just 10 days. Not like the investigation had been doing on for a long time under Berman. Lol you kiddos have no idea how stuff actually WORKS. Real life isn't like your movies and fantasies.
<|endoftext|>Spout your evangelical nonsense to someone else. Protestant corruption is deep as well. The Catholic Church is the largest Christian church in the world. You dont know your history clearly if you claim Catholics are not Christian absolute nonsense. Trump isnt a man of god. His god is money. Most of the people up at the top who claim to be Christian  really worship money and power.
<|endoftext|>Im loving the fact you dont give a shit about my feelings. Maybe youre not such a pussy after all...still a shill thoughYes, theres a general feeling that you cant say positive things about Trump or his administration in public without being looked down upon bc of how the msm paints him in a terrible light. Like mask wearing...People have been brainwashed into parrots of the msm
<|endoftext|>I respect your opinion and the research youve done, but Ive been pretty deep into this since 2017 and am fairly confident in my position. For Trump to be involved, literally the entire sex trafficking ring would have to be a psyop. If you have any evidence Im happy to take a look
<|endoftext|>I havent even posted anything on reddit before this. If you want to look at my burner twitter PM me and Ill provide it, and youll see Im really not spreading any bigoted ideas. Yes I dont want my identity associated with these posts, I have a corporate job and understand theyre waaaay too far out there to have them associated with my name. That doesnt discount the credibility of what Im sharing, if anything it shows that I cant even share ideas without fearing for my career and relationships
<|endoftext|>I keep everything locked down very private, do I need to worry? No one can see my photos unless theyre connected to me on social media. That includes my profile pictures on Facebook. I have a 1 year old and this stuff terrifies me
<|endoftext|>I see now that's what I had figured. For a moment I thought the threat was that someone can hack the location of the photo
<|endoftext|>Yeah, it makes sense. Google and interested parties run long troll campaigns coupled with targeted hate speech with fake channels and bots. Add a little corporate cooperation and channels not touting the company line are systematically eradicated pushing the content to a similar but undeveloped platform which in turn is hit 100 times harder with the same fake hate speech that stays up this time delegitimizing the entire platform for those people who are only beginning to become aware of the concepts that can now only openly be discussed there. Wouldn't take that much effort the second time, and let's not forget Gis Max was until just recently one of the largest curators and most active users of this site.
<|endoftext|>After watching the mouthy Buddha videos I googled him. He seems extremely anti Semitic which makes me question the videos.
<|endoftext|>Hm, yes. Jeffrey Epstein is watching all of us, every individual word we type- deleting all those who dare make accusations from their very existence. You sweet summer child wrapped in the kashmir blanket of ignorance. SUSAN IS COMING FOR YOU- FOR US ALL!
<|endoftext|>Yea, the ritual itself begins a placebo effect within people. Also, holy water itself is not just H2O. I don't know if you've heard of colloidal silver, but this stuff helps that body heal from ailments. I believe holy water to be a diluted form of colloidal silver which is made with an electrical current. I've been to Catholic churches and they usually leave something silver in the holy water or the tray is made from silver.
<|endoftext|> Holy water would be another example. Chemically, structurally identical to good old H2O, but to hardcore Christians is so much moreSure but the claims in this sub are often about it having real impacts on the user -- reducing aging, etc.
<|endoftext|>You're right to an extent, not anything is possible, anything can be believed to be possible. I guess I phrased it poorly, it's completely possible that nutjobs are drinking blood because they believe it has special properties, and there's no governing law of reality that makes it impossible for crazy people to believe that magic exists or to drink baby blood, what requires extraordinary evidence is if they are or are not drinking blood, and if it's actually special, not if they could or if they think its special.
<|endoftext|>There was a 60 Minutes segment that covered his crimes, and the journalist actually interviewed him in jail. He is absolutely unrepentant. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for fucked up things after many years on the internet, but that interview... watching that interview broke me. I remember walking around my house with fists clenched for like an hour afterwards. If he was in front of me I would have killed him right then and there. I don't recall ever before or since being so palpably moved to anger from just watching a video. He is truly the most vile, wretched form of evil.
<|endoftext|>I do not know if my friend is delusional or not. He isn't shilling but he has some mental illness. I love him fiercely.I was wrong about the date, as it was late March when he mentioned it to me.
<|endoftext|> For starters, there are 400,000 priests who are all enabling pedophilia by not openly revolting against those who allow it to happen. So, really, I could have called it an army of 400,000 strongso you admit that you pulled the number out of your arse.we're good.
<|endoftext|> While you do nothing and troll?i'm asking you to substantiate your assertion. to quote you:"if you aren't going to provide any evidence then nobody should take your statement seriously"well-said! Add up all the convicted pedophile priests in all the court cases in the news, and tell me what you get, first.how many of those priests were pederasts as opposed to pedophiles? do you even understand the distinction? I've been publishing for years.wow, i didn't realize you've spent years (YEARS!) posting stuff on the internet.i'm sorry for not uncritically believing everything you write. I'll help you get started, but what number are you asserting, so we all know how far off the mark you think I am?well, the total number of priests worldwide is [less than 500,000]( and the highest estimates place the prevalence of clerical sexual abuse of minors (not limited to pedophilia) at around 4% of the total population of priests over the past ~50 years, so your claim of "100,000 strong" -- even including "pedophile enablers" -- is, speaking as charitably as possible, egregiously wrong.
<|endoftext|>Turns out that book is really a seven page short story not written by p diddy but a woman named candy Michelle Johnson or Michelle michinin. Im assuming thats why it was removed from Barnes n nobles site and cant be found anywhere else. Searching her name on amazon brings up all these other weird self published books about other celebrities and other weird crap. Bummer.
<|endoftext|>People trying to maintain a secret hold over the entire world would know better than to take such risks.
<|endoftext|>I think it's way more relevant and rampant in elite/celebrity circles than anybody first thought. Even Avicii's death was questionable (look up For a Better Day).
<|endoftext|>you want eerie, how about Avengers Endgame having all those long scenes of empty, quiet cities with everyone lounging at home in their pajamas with frazzled confused mental health? LAST YEAR we all got those specific images primed into our brains?2023 was mentioned several times in that movie and I suspect something is gonna go down in that year 2023. I've 2023 referred to in a few circumstances/medias actually.
<|endoftext|>So the moral of Monsters Inc. is get off adrenochrome and get everyone on heroin instead!And also children's closets are dimensonal portals!
<|endoftext|>Because synthetic cannabis isnt completely the same substance- they arent actually THC. A better analogue would be vanillin- theres no chemical difference between synthetic and natural vanillin.Ill start considering the metaphysical approach when theres even the smallest shred of evidence that anything metaphysical is more than something people made up to explain something they didnt know.
<|endoftext|>...You spent the first half of your paragraph arguing against my point, and the second half arguing for my point. Im honestly not sure where youre coming from, now.First you say theres no evidence because of course theres not because they have resources to make sure theres not. Cool. Then I accuse you of being a pedophile rapist murderer. Wait, you disagree? You want me to present evidence of your guilt? Sorry bud, but theres a reason theres no evidence. Okay, so here we are with no evidence of your guilt, which you said we wont find anyway. Ya know how one finds evidence? Investigation! Mother fucking thorough investigation, in fact. Which is convenient, because all I was pointing out to begin with was how there was no actual investigation done - only accusation, which isnt the same thing. But, hey, looks like you want investigation. Which means that, even though you said before there would be no evidence because the pedos are rich, you think that we actually could find evidence through investigation... whatever, bit of a flip-flop, but Im fine with that.So, weve landed on-Pedos are bad. We should get evidence of pedos being bad.We need to investigate pedos to gather evidence.Sole accusation equals neither evidence nor investigation.Meaning, Kappys accusations without a shred of evidence or investigative proof should not be taken as proof of evidence, because we have just as much evidence from him as I do of you being a pedophile yourself. Agreed?
<|endoftext|>I dont know man and I doubt the truth about that is even recorded anywhere within the public eye. Very powerful people had to be the ones pulling the strings in that situation, cause like you said, it makes no fucking sense.
<|endoftext|>Man, it was ditch weed that got turned into brick weed. Shit is a complement to the worst you can imagine. What a long, strange trip it's been...
<|endoftext|>We are "lumping" Trump in because he was pictured with him, just like everyone else who is being lumped with Epstein. Trump doesn't get a pass, it doesn't work that way. You dont have any clue what Trump suspected, those are your words not Trumps words. And who says this hasn't been happening for DECADES?
<|endoftext|>This one was the big eye opener for me BUT enter the pizza gate docu was WAAAAY more thorough and factual.
<|endoftext|>So if Trump is the good guy, why the remarks on how Epstein is a great guy who likes women on the younger side? Why did he walk in our young girls changing? Why so many sexual misconduct allegations against him? Why did he hire so many people who protected Epstein, and why not tweet anything now, when he loves tweeting so much?
<|endoftext|>Are your trolling, if not I gotta hear about this. Why do you even put Michelle Obama maybe is a man??? How can that piece of info be worthy o making the same list as a terror group. Its sad that you distract from real issues like pedos in power by adding all your other trash.
<|endoftext|>A lot of this is true, but Michelle is a woman. Cant fake that voice. She got them manly arms and shoulders though.
<|endoftext|>Im not a Trumpet by any means, think hes crude and has treated multiple wives horribly. But so many on the right are evangelicals and believe in forgiveness. So theyre in the camp hoping Trump is changed and hope he continues to speak with his actions rather than his thumbs.
<|endoftext|>Its a couple of photos with him when hes was in NYC. Your MSMaites are beyond gullible  care more about the mean things that he says than what hes actually doing. He barred him from his properties
<|endoftext|>no way. catholics worship mary, which is directly the opposite of what JESUS Taught. catholics pray to mary and other saints, which is idolatry and far from what JESUS taught."CHRISTian" is a word that means "little CHRISTS" and is a name for those who follow CHRIST. Many people call themselves CHRISTian but do not follow CHRIST; those are false CHRISTians.If you read CHRIST'S actual Words like the red letter KJV, you will find that there was a religious group back then called the pharisees. read about them and tell me they don't sound like catholics, cause they do, and JESUS was very much against their teachings because they were putting on religious shows for men and not for GOD.
<|endoftext|>If your ideas jeopardize your career and family that could also mean your ideas are poisonous. I personally would distance myself from you because of the trash your pushing. And I love conspiracies and jumping down rabbit holes. But your ideas seem very politically and racially motivated. And generally speaking progressive people dont want to associated with those ideas.
<|endoftext|>I would ensure your profile pictures are limited as in the only one public is your current one. Same with your cover photos. As long as you know every one who follows you, then it's okay..I do the same. But sometimes I worry my mom's stuff is public and she shares stuff or they get access. It scares me in general thinking about the young babies and toddlers just being used and sold. It's horrifying.
<|endoftext|>Synogog of Satan...is what the Bible refers to...who has synogogs? The Jews killed Jesus...the current Jews(Israhell) deny he is the Messiah. The Bible is clear, you only get to the Father thru the son.The narrative that Israel and the Biblical Christian's are chums is fabricated. Eric Dubay did a great documentary on the history of the Jews. YouTube or course would not let it fly. I watched it years ago. Not sure where to find it now.Rothschild are Jewish. Ever see the photo of Abramavich and Rothschild standing in front of the painting about Satan summoning his legions? They don't even try and hide their satanism...or their Jewishness. Open your eyes.
<|endoftext|>As with any group of people, they are all different. A small percentage belongs to a Luciferian cult. Most of them are regular Jews just trying to make a living.
<|endoftext|>Or maybe it actually works, but I'm not about to ritualistically sacrifice a person to find out. Maybe an ultimate truth they know that we dont is that our realm is dominated by a negative entity that actually rewards evil behaviour. But if that's the case I'm happy to stay blue pilledI actually didnt know they put silver in holy water, thanks for that. That's pretty interesting, not only for its healing property but also its mythological association, especially in a thread about "vampires"
<|endoftext|> holy water itself is not just H2OCatholic holy water is absolutely just water. It's simply water that's been blessed by a priest.
<|endoftext|>No problem. And thank you too! I learned a valuable lesson in hubris: No more inebriated posting. It impairs my cognitive faculties just like it affects everyone else's. I'm not special in that regard, not at all.
<|endoftext|>Why does the distinction matter between a pedo and someone who rapes a slighty older male child several times? And where are you getting the stats that the majority of the children who are being molested are young adolecents and not also prepubecent children?Are we supposed to be like oh dont worry guys, their mostly raping 12 year olds, not 8 year olds! Move along now
<|endoftext|>I don't usually care about a lot of stuff but when I had first seen that to find out he "died" not too long after brought a tear to my eye.
<|endoftext|>First of all, I want to make a disclaimer that your original comment sounded like one of the common shill responses that plague reddit and especially this sub. The kind of response that signals hey theres no hard evidence so nothing to see here. Please move on you dumb conspiracy theorists. Idk why you went all out on this reply, but not your original comment because if you would have stated your complete stance on the issue, I wouldnt have said what I said.Now,I never stated that we cant find evidence because theyre rich. I said finding that hard evidence would be next to impossible because of their connections and resources to suppress it. That is why I said theres a reason why theres no hard evidence. I should have added at the moment at the end of that statement because it will eventually surface if America and the world can get their heads out of their asses for just a bit. We dont live in a lovely, empathetic world where our leaders, lawmakers, celebrities, and influencers dont lie and everything is black and white. I wish more people would realize that. With the video that you originally commented about, that is what you call a lead. A lead in an investigation thats almost like a trail of crumbs to all the evidence we need. The dude isnt going to just come out and speak on such topics for no reason, but to start fake shit. He was angry and genuinely concerned. He wanted to be a voice of the countless celebrities and others involved that just stay silent. Im not condemning it as hard evidence, but you have to put it into context to realize that we should take his word especially seriously. Accusations are not evidence and that is correct, but as for someone who is in the industry and has these connections like Kappy, I feel like we should be listening and performing further investigation and utilizing people like him to get to the ultimate truth to take these people down. All these celebrities and certain insiders are screaming at us that theres something going on here. We know without a fucking doubt this pedophile ring is in existence and its disgustingly prevalent and massive. I hope we can both agree on that.
<|endoftext|>Wrong. Like the other commenter said which you didn't respond to...Isaac Kappy was right about Tim Gunn. Right? Right. So the fact that he was posthumously proved correct, absolutely lend credibility to the rest of his information he divulged in the same vein/same time period - which likely came from the same source or diligent research. And nothing should ever be dismissed without looking into it yourself. You have no idea if kappy was right or wrong - but you obviously have some sort of personal reason(bias) that leads you to *want* to say that because there is no evidence served to meOn a silver platter and all the evidence is either circumstantial or testimonial - all suspicions should be dropped until further notice. You'd make a great Devil's Advocate (and in this context I am directly referencing the scene in the movie where he defends the pedophile by disparaging the victim's testimonial as untrustworthy).
<|endoftext|>It probably HAS been happening for decades! Those decades that Trump had nothing to do with them! Trump2020 Four more years!
<|endoftext|>I agree, wife and I fell down the rabbithole and everyone we try to tell is to scared to even think about it or just writes it off, so typical but it all seems way too true....
<|endoftext|>No you dont... because before long it will be all they/you watch. Depressing with a side order of suicide please!?
<|endoftext|>Many people just can't handle it and it's not their fault. Truly, their nervous systems just won't allow room for it, so it's important to be compassionate. Pretty much everyone that I'm close to refuses to see/hear about any of this stuff. Not everyone is here to wake up, some ppl just can't do it. Your peeps are on here, though!
<|endoftext|>Im not saying its 100%, but you cannot say there isnt compelling evidence in this video 
<|endoftext|>genuinely on the fence here, but the one thing I can't get over is *why DT* would say such terrible things if he really is a good guy? Like, mocking the disabled reporter in his campaign for example? or the many instances of racist and sexist tweets etc. if he is doing "good things behind the scenes" why would he be fueling white supremacy in the public eye.. I don't watch the news or anything because I do understand how MSM skews things and lies etc, but this isn't about how MSM portrays him, it's literally just the things he says. it just doesn't make sense.
<|endoftext|>Of course! You can tell Trump and Epstein hate each other the way they're laughing together. It's clearly just an act to fool the "Deep State". Just think about it. Trump is a billionaire landlord. He does not care about you. At all.
<|endoftext|>Completely agree with that. I think Q is both a political tool and a conduit for releasing information that Trump wants to release without him having to publicly say crazy shit. Lets not forget that before Q, no one had given such specific insight into Podesta and Epstein in particular. Theyre (Trump, Flynn, + rest of Q team) is either bringing this issue to light while simultaneously using it as a means to cover their own asses, or is bringing it to light because they cant stand seeing whats happening. Trump has 100% had sex with prostitutes. I haaaaaaated Trump in 2016 and felt sick when he was elected. I looked objectively trying to find anything that would implicate Trump. All Ive been able to find is that there may be guilt by association due to pictures being taken of them together, but to my knowledge this was back in 1992. When I found out the DNC essentially funded the rape cases against him and pulled the Russian collusion narrative out of thin air, to me it started becoming clear that theyre (the media, superstars, and other politicians) not targeting Trump for how terrible of a guy hes alleged to be. Theyre targeting him because theyre terrified of what he may bring to the surface
<|endoftext|>Is the guy that claimed in court that he smoked crack and performed oral sex on Barack racist? You realize that guy died a week later and he isnt the first to come out and say this and die shortly after... all Im saying is that these mysterious deaths combined with other historical/visual evidence makes me feel that its a very real possibility
<|endoftext|>I can see how you could think my posts are politically motivated, because I have voiced support for Trump multiple times. As I mentioned before, Im a life long liberal. My mom was an immigrant from South Korea, my friend group is fairly diverse, and Ive taken voluntary trainings through my company to learn about blind spots and absolutely admit I have had my fair share of them that needed to be addressed. However, in no way am I some sort of bigot that has an inherent disdain for black people, nothing Ive ever said, done, or posted suggests that. I dont know what else to say to convince you but I really am progressive, and have studied the history of systemic racism to no end. Im fine with us having differing opinions but to suggest my opinion about Michelle being a man is racially charged is completely out of left field
<|endoftext|>Just meaning that those on the bottom may be more culpable in this system but thats not true. It takes intellectual dishonesty to believe that but most people participate in that kind of thinking because its a psychological mechanism we use to project wrongdoing away from ourselves.
<|endoftext|>Silver is used for its antibacterial properties. I make colloidal silver at home and it is a very useful thing to have around. Back in ancient times armies traveled with potable water in huge silver cauldrons because it kept the water drinkable over long periods of time.I work with my hands quite a bit and constantly have cuts and abrasions on myself. Many might remember when there was a Curad silver line out on the market. It had an extreme (which was great for working people) that had silver in it. In fact the wounds covered by the silver-added bandages healed in half the time. Then the FDA made it (silver) a controlled substance that had to have approval to be included in any treatment (or some such nonsense). They were successful in the removal of the silver part in products all the way up until they hit the burn ward in hospitals where they were basically told to fuck off by people who work in those areas and see the good that silver does in the care of such painful afflictions (or so I read somewhere - it's been a while). Anyway that's why silver is put into water - keeps it bug-free and potable (among other benefits).
<|endoftext|>Thanks! Thats the one meditation I have to study and study and study! Ive heard people go mental after!
<|endoftext|>There is no distinction. They're trying to make one worse than the other, so that one gets normalized. This dude is sick, and hes probably getting paid.
<|endoftext|> Why does the distinction matter between a pedo and someone who rapes a slighty older male child several times?at the most basic level, the distinction matters because facts matter. we cannot expect people to make informed evaluations of and decisions about problems facing them if they don't have accurate information and accurate categories with which to think about it.at another level of abstraction, the distinction matters because the word "pedophile" invokes an entirely appropriate reflex reaction of visceral disgust and loathing. many people find it difficult to think rationally about this subject, and so linguistic precision is necessary. none of this is to say that adults with disordered passions taking advantage of older individuals who are still minors is not morally objectionable, only different. do you see a distinction between an adult taking advantage of a five year old versus a fifteen year old? And where are you getting the stats that the majority of the children who are being molested are young adolecents and not also prepubecent children?among other sources, the john jay report. if you have evidence to the contrary, i'm all eyes. Are we supposed to be like oh dont worry guys, their mostly raping 12 year olds, not 8 year olds! Move along nowno. pseudo-sexual abuse in the Church (as in the wider society) is a grave sin, and efforts must be made to stamp it out. at the same time, we must maintain a sense of proportion and a commitment to empirical method in evaluating the nature and extent of the problem so that we can arrive at lasting, just, and effective solutions. anyone claiming that the Church is somehow more prone to producing, harboring, and facilitating "pedophilia" than most (or all) other institutions is either dishonest or misinformed.*spez - added "pseudo" to clarify my meaning
<|endoftext|>Nah, just someone who understands that people smart enough to be capable of maintaining a secret conspiracy of world domination wouldnt risk said conspiracy for shits and giggles.
<|endoftext|>Poor Isaac man. The dude set himself up a bit but he surely made a lot of things make sense. You can see when he's being truthful so clearly in the video. Tom Hanx is a fucking psycho.
<|endoftext|>Proven correct about what, exactly? What were his exact claims about Tim Gunn that have been proven correct?
<|endoftext|>Because you said so, whatever you say pedo voter. And I literally do NOT care who the President is or will be. Because it's always SameBullshit2020
<|endoftext|>I will never understand people who consider there to be some truth to this stuff but refuse to watch or learn anything about it. It's amazing to me that people can just turn a blind eye, be in denial and try to remain blissfully ignorant. It's usually people who haven't had too many hard times in life and want to pretend life is great and the state of the world is just fine.
<|endoftext|>I have found that if I can just get people to watch the documentary on Marc Dutroux, then that is all they need to be switched.  It is all fact and stranger than fiction... no conjecture. But - a lot of people don't want to be red pilled.
<|endoftext|>Same with me everyone I try to tell says I need a tin foil hat. I just wish there was something I could do to help all the innocent kids. So very said
<|endoftext|>That's probably true actually. Good point. I do think depression has gotten worse sense I've gotten more into it...or it could also be due to covid and bring isolated. Probably combo and the reason I watch so much is out of boredom
<|endoftext|>that is the most stupid conspiracy based in racism Ive ever heard. And what fucking difference would it make. That is not a conspiracy, that is just being an asshat
<|endoftext|>My aunt (moms biological sister) looks like handsome squidward. Shes still a women that birthed two children.
<|endoftext|>In the video its just a bunch of white men all hatin just because Barack Obama supported gays.i remember in middle school when it was the elections to elect Obama or Rodney this one white kid moved outta America because he said having a black president is gonna make the country go to shit.bunch of white kids at my school walking around saying were going to have a monkey president.these are the same white kids that went walking around in my highschool with a maga hat on yellin at all the Latinos to go back to there country
<|endoftext|>My aunt (moms biological sister) looks like handsome squidward. Shes still a women that birthed two children.
<|endoftext|>Tbh I feel like people only say this type of theory is because theyre black:/ youre probably a white American thats very patriotic
<|endoftext|>only responding bc you're on the fence. If you dig to the bottom of nearly all of Trump's horrible sound bites you'll find its usually something that is taken completely out of context, e.g. he mocks a bunch of people with the same "disabled" act and that reporter wasn't even spastic. [ same thing goes for all of the pro-racist things he supposedly said e.g. when he said white supremecists were fine people, he did not say that at all [
<|endoftext|>Do you believe that the DNC funded the rape allegations against him, but not that Trump funded conspiracy theories like Pizzagate to get elected instead of Clinton? Did the DNC also fund his ex wives allegations and those of the girls he walked in on changing? Did the DNC also force him to say that when you're rich and powerful like he is he can just grab women by the pussy?
<|endoftext|>Lets play a game, if Barack WAS gay, who the fuck cares. This is bigoted homophobic and racist. Please, take a step back and look at what you are putting out in the world.
<|endoftext|>So what if Barack gave someone a blowjob? He could be bisexual and in an open relationship? Or literally who cares if he felt he has to be in tye closet to get elected as a gay and black man.
<|endoftext|>Joan Rivers joked before she died that Obama was gay and Michelle was a tranny. I am a die hard conservative and despise the Obamas( not because of race. I love Ben Carson, Candace Owens, Diamond and Silk and many more) I feel like Obama was very divisive. I absolutely thought the Michelle tranny thing was crazy at first- but after seeing videos and pics I have to wonder... however it would be very hard to keep a secret-more people would have come out by now to back it up- its pretty far fetched but very intriguing. I think Joan Rivers is the one who made people curious about this
<|endoftext|>Then trust me when I say, the VAST majority of black people would find your post so offensive and hateful. Yet, you will continue to say I dont mean to preach hate. But you leave it up there, if you practice what you preach, edit your post. You are demonstrating that you dont learn from experience but instead you double down on your prexisting beliefs
<|endoftext|>It may be hard to find but I've found Kundalini classes. They're kinda hippy dippy/yoga mom but it's a good intro and obviously safe.
<|endoftext|>So basically the distinction matters because the word Pedophile invokes disgust and you dont think fucking 11 year old children is disgusting, and so you find that distinction important?Hmmmm... Interesting.
<|endoftext|>He was brave, and tbf he probably knew what would happen. I dont doubt him, at all... there was real anger in those videos. He was legit.
<|endoftext|>Why don't you look into it for yourself? Or don't? I'm not the Isaac kappy/Tim gunn Guru here to guide you down the rabbit hole
<|endoftext|>I think there are plenty of people who know all too much about it and can't stand to look at it anymore without going crazy, I don't blame them. Not everyone is up to it.
<|endoftext|>No way, they're not bad people just because they don't want to see it. I freely admitted to not looking because it woke my ptsd. Now it's woke, that doesn't make me a bad person
<|endoftext|>Laziness and stubbornness, people only believe it when they see it on the TV, if it's on the internet it's not true, only when it's publicly displayed regardless it being distorted. Sad but our job to try the best we can to try to inform them and hopefully one person believe and informs another. Hopefully Trump keeps the fight going long enough to open eyes across the world.
<|endoftext|>People can watch hours of pointless tv including the news, but won't give anything even with a slight truthful possibilty their time, sad but all we can do is hope for the best and stay strong together
<|endoftext|>You can add me to your list. Just saw some zembla documentaries about the x-files (Regina Louf) and saw something about Lex Werner being Epstein's only client. Mix that with 13th from Netflix, brightest red ever...
<|endoftext|>Maybe we will what some good news in the briefings resuming daily tomorrow at 5pm, have faith in your country, your president and humanity!
<|endoftext|>Theres nothing wrong with truth seeking, all I will say is tread the line carefully as some realisations are to painful to ever really come back from
<|endoftext|>So you're cool with being lied to if it's true??? Shit like this makes all the difference IN THE WORLD
<|endoftext|>Make your own conclusion, but you cant say that there isnt evidence that points toward the idea that shes a man
<|endoftext|>No it really dosnt. I was actually kind of joking..until I watched the video below. Maybe you should open your mind up a little and stop being such an asshole. It's ok to not be a dick sometimes
<|endoftext|>Look into pizzagate [ realize that human trafficking arrests are way up since he's been in office, and that he acknowledged that child predators should suffer the death penalty [ and see all of the massive opposition against him and you'll know that he's on the good side. He might have been a playboy/womanizer but the other side is way worse, e.g. raping, torturing, and killing children.
<|endoftext|>I agree the GOP is just as involved as the DNC when it comes to pedophilia. And Im sure there are some people like Lindsey Graham who act like theyre team Trump when theyre actually likely implicated. Do you have any info that suggests he has made deals with these people? I think many people are saying why cant he just arrest all of them already ... because this isnt about sex trafficking, this is about stopping an insurrection led by foreign terror groups
<|endoftext|>I have no issues with gay people, I have a gay cousin and my step-aunts son is also gay. Grew up with my blood cousin and am very close with him and his boyfriend. I support Beto, have no issue with gay people. The revelation that shes trans is undeniably mind blowing, being interested in finding if theres truth to that claim has nothing to do with whether or not you support gays or not
<|endoftext|>Why did everyone get so angry with Clintons heterosexual blow job? Because it was immoral...because he was our married president. Obama homosexual blow job, is just as troubling as Clintons...because he is the president and his is married. So get off the racist/prejudice band wagon, and think beyond your offended feelings.
<|endoftext|>They may find it offensive because they dont think shes trans and it appears to be a baseless claim, but I highly doubt theyd call it racist. Both of my black roommates believe shes a dude, which is anecdotal, but from the way you speak Im assuming your sample size of close black friends is pretty small
<|endoftext|>You act like its an option to be blue pilled. If we dont **ALL** wake up fast then were in for a future of total enslavement. Js. We are running out of time.
<|endoftext|>Colloidal silver water is made by using electrolysis and say a pure silver coin in distilled water to suspend silver particles in the distilled water. It's fairly easy to do if you have the correct materials and know-how.Colloidal silver is good to drink limited amounts every so often, it is anti-bacterial, anti-viral and makes your skin turn blue if you drink enough of it. Haha.
<|endoftext|>Technically yes it would be helpful. Back in the day they would give a kid a silver spoon to play with and suck on because it killed germs. That's what "born with a silver spoon in your mouth" came from. We made it a long, long way without big pharma because we used creative, natural remedies and prevention strategies.
<|endoftext|> So basically the distinction matters because the word Pedophile invokes disgust and you dont think fucking 11 year old children is disgusting, so you find that distinction important?i think that abuse of an 11 year old is reprehensible, but i think that abuse of a 5 year old is more reprehensible. fwiw, "f***ing" refers to sexual activity, and i don't consider sodomitical acts to be sexual in nature. Hmmmm... Interesting.you are not having this discussion in good faith and it is clear that i am wasting my time. i hope that you have an abundantly blessed life and will say a prayer for you tonight.
<|endoftext|>Oh he knew, he specifically replied to someone asking if he was worried about his own safety and he replied something along the lines of yes but Im worried about everybody else more, like this shit is absolutely sickening
<|endoftext|>I tried, but after 10 minutes couldnt even find Kappys comments on Gunn, so I cant tell of Kappys assertions were true. But You claimed they were, so as the accuser, the burden of proof is kinda on you. But I know that Gunn hasnt had any proof come out of pedophilia. If all youre talking about is the old edgy Gunn tweets, then Im just gonna laugh, because thats not proof of anything other than an old shite sense of humor.But, if Im wrong and theres more, enlighten me and prove it. Otherwise Im just gonna laugh again cause you went to all the trouble of getting fired up over that Devils Advocate monologue and all the evidence you had on your side were a couple old tweets.
<|endoftext|>Yes I can, this is blatant racism. You should be ashamed of yourself. I guarantee you wouldnt post your name next to these opinions because you know they are poison.
<|endoftext|>Id say so. Its an old trope that had been used against black women. I understand if you havent experienced it. But ask a black woman how this would make her feel. There is a history here that you just may not be aware of
<|endoftext|>Sure go ahead and misrepresent a mocking panicky act as pretending to be "handicapped". You are fake news.
<|endoftext|>So, again, why don't he arrest them? I mean, for the sex trafficking it would be weird if the president himself went after them, but for this it would be legit. I mean he is also a really powerful guy with a lot of followers, why he doesn't do anything beside building walls?
<|endoftext|>No we got angry because he lied under oath you nit wit, no one cares about a bj. Youre the one who seem easily offended, if you cant handle the scandal of a guy getting a hummer outside of marriage
<|endoftext|>I dont know what else to say, Im not gunna convince you from my couch that your ideas hurt people, even though they do. I can only speak my part and hope that one day ideas like your finally die out completely.
<|endoftext|>Maybe but some people, give them all the info on this HT stuff and theyll pop themselves. If its the truth stop digging into it in any illogical way, theres got to be hard evidence or no purge. I do not want to be a victim of a serotonin surge that makes me a murderer.
<|endoftext|>Yeah, that was part of the home remedy for HIV/AIDS, colloidal silver, alkaline water and low voltage electrocution. What you had to do supposedly was to restrict your diet completely changing yourself to an alkaline state, then electrocute yourself very mildly many times a day. You also had to have some special tools to penetrate your organs with deep tissue pulsar something voltage. I forget, Bob something's cure. Anyway it cured you because you destroyed the ability of the virus to procreate. So every day in an arduous process you weakened and sterilized the virus itself until it was extinct. There were people who cured themselves, re contracted the virus then cured themselves again, purportedly. It was a long drawn out possibly up to a 6 month process? A lot of hard work, dramatic lifestyle reversal. Speaking of HIV/AIDS, what's the story now is this virus still 'there'? I heard some blips by the MSM during the beginning of this virus that made it seem as if HIV wasn't what we believed it was, wasn't remotely what we thought and wasn't a problem. Anyone else hear that?
<|endoftext|>Okay? And raping a fetus is even worse, what. Is. Your. Point?Anal rape is rape.No, in bad faith actually, its kinda fucked up that you are downplaying child rape, dont consider anal rape rape and feel confident in these beliefs.
<|endoftext|>Its racist just because shes black? If anything your insinuation that this is racist unnecessarily brings race into the conversation. This has nothing to do with race, it has to do with her perceived biological sex. Youre acting like Im forcing my beliefs on you when even in the original post I said she very well could be a man. If you watch that entire video I dont see how you can argue that theres ZERO chance
<|endoftext|>I used a racist trope? Where?Did you watch the video tho? We only want to watch what fits our narrative, eh?
<|endoftext|>Oh I see so in your intimate knowledge, you assumed I am only angry because of a BJ...or perhaps I just proved that you have hurt feelings and the only way for you to save face is to try to straw man me with an argument that in no way shape or form has anything to do with your original argument. You know what they say, when one starts calling another names in the heat of an argument..it is because they lost. I win!!!
<|endoftext|>Thats completely ok with me. Just know this has nothing to do with some sort of deep seeded hatred for gays and blacks. My original intent was to just share that pedogate video and be done with this. The reason I continued posting is because of the overwhelmingly positive response I got. Because this is a topic Im passionate about, I saw each person that didnt know about this before as an opportunity to flip peoples votes in what I believe to be the right direction. I dont see any shame in doing that. After 9 different people DMd me I figured Id post some of the most mind-blowing revelations Ive had that people interested in pedogate would like, which is where I included the bullet point about Michelle. I posted this to pique peoples interest and encourage them to do additional research on their own. I understand why my beliefs can come off as completely outlandish, but to suggest theyre being fueled by bigotry, racism, and hate is just plain wrong.
<|endoftext|>Yeah except most of these people are only getting their information from the msm and theyll never EVER give you correct and truthful information. We need to start educating people unless you want to bring up our future generations into a tyrannical global dictatorship full of control and misery. Its up to you. Beautiful world we can all thrive in based off the truth or total enslavement. You pick. This is about altruism not the convenience of some dude who doesnt want to believe in that stuff because its not the reality he wants to live in
<|endoftext|>I never heard what you are speaking of with regards to HIV and colloidal silver. Don't get me wrong, it wouldn't surprise me a bit but I never heard that. You have any links or information I could read up on that a bit; that sounds fascinating.
<|endoftext|>Certainly hope so. I like being proven wrong & learning. Just hope that your vaunted "evidence" you were hailing before wasn't as weak as a couple old tweets.
<|endoftext|>It is a historically racist charge to accuse black women of being manly. And its sad that this idea still exists because of people like u
<|endoftext|>The video is a joke, and the fact that you think it proves anything also speaks to your intelligence
<|endoftext|>Calling black women manly is a racist trope. Which is what is happening here. Just go back r/Donald
<|endoftext|>Just be careful, lots of people lurk I. This sub with racist and ultra right wing views. You will find support for negative posts, dont be fooled into thinking that means you are correct or will be supported by the rest of society
<|endoftext|>Fair enough, but I would suggest you not condemn people who are asleep or want to remain asleep. Reason being it makes them defend their position. Im not sure drawing attention to this is the right thing to do vs handling it, but I dont know m. This is a witch hunt though. You need hard evidence. This is in the military. Youre not coming near the problem if youre obsessed with celebrities. Its the military, the politicians and its in normal people everywhere. If you really wanted to solve this problem get the ids from the CP and chase the lead to the real source. Find the bodies. You know what make an AI do it, that way you wont have to sacrifice your life.
<|endoftext|>Heres a link I found:  been years since I learned about this, and have never tried it myself. I havent seen this video. Have a good one
<|endoftext|>Whatever... you totally missed the point of my original comment and I don't care. Here's the kappy video i believe he was talking about
<|endoftext|>Why are you even here? Dudes packing and that offends you. Get over it or call him up to suck his dick? I've never seen someone so offended lol. You're lack of intelligence is really starting to shine here
<|endoftext|>I never did that. Where did I say she's a black manly woman? You ok? It's always turned into race even when someone clearly isn't being a race. I think you should just stay on r/news?
<|endoftext|>That explains why you thought this was racist then. I do follow a lot of right wing personalities but trust me Im no confederate flag hanging conservative. I appreciate the concern and that you dont tolerate racism/bigotry, but in this case I truly didnt intend for the info I shared to come off as racially charged or homophobic by any means. I know I shared a lot of anecdotal evidence in my replies but those things are actually true
<|endoftext|>Its like the whole birther charge. Not racist on its face, but lo and behold, its the racist that usually push those unfounded claims
<|endoftext|>Sure you're right about that but that doesn't mean this dude is being racist. Just because a lot of racists are white doesn't mean all whites are racist. So just because a lot of racists say Michelle is a man doesn't mean every person that believes so are also racist.
<|endoftext|>Agreed. This is a reddit account I made to post one thing months ago, other than that this is my first post, so I wasnt really aware how easily my ideas could be conflated with racism etc
<|endoftext|>If you wont say it, I will...u/spitwitandwater sounds like a shill pussy. You didnt say anything even close to being offensive, its just pissed that you made a good pro-Trump argument.
<|endoftext|>I believe that part of this theory is that Saturn used to be Earth's sun. Which I don't discount as a possibility. I have always found it odd that our 'Sun' has no official scientific name. All other stars are named with a particular system in astrophysics. But ours is just 'Sun', 'Sol', or 'Solis'. Weird because science loves labeling everything. And the persistent theories that perhaps our Sun is really part of a binary star system. This could maybe have to do with Saturn as an ex-star as well. Also randomly- on January 19, 2020, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky tweeted 'Despite climate alarmist predictions, humans will likely survive for hundreds of millions of years into the future. In the meantime, we should begin creating atmospheres on suitable moons or planets.' He then tweeted, 'With so many billionaires about, why not a private prize of $10 million for the scientist who genetically creates an O2 producing organism that will thrive in the frigid, methane lakes of Titan \[Saturn's moon\]?'
<|endoftext|>The black Saturn time cube is the idea of the 6. In it's current form it's the 6th planet from the sun with the eternal 6 sided black storm. Soon we will be ruled by the quantum computer which takes the form of the black cube, and the blockchain which is a collection of cubes. A cube has six sidesWay back in the day this group of highwaymen and robbers from across the river ( the habarus "hebrews" according to Egyptian artifacts ), mastered the art of the fake religion. This is the beginning of the Judaism and the Bible. It was a psyop to convince a bunch of rugged violent people that they needed to give their power to a divine bloodline that got it's orders from a fake God called Yahweh Jehovah. This bloodline then moved into the greatest empire of the time, Egypt, and through deceit and black magic robbed the empire blind and eventually got the people and pharaoh of egypt to worship the fake religion by incorporating the ideas of their religion, the Tarot, into their own, the Torah. This is why the old testament contains so much gematria and other occult ideas in it.With the habarus in total control of egypt they quickly bankrupted the empire through taxation and socialist programs until it fell to the Greeks. The habarus then left egypt with what strength they had left and settled in the land of Canaan. This put them at the center of critical trade routes between Asia and Europe and with the help of a strange cult near the dead sea that preached giving up material wealth, sex, and socialism in the persuit of God, they were able to combine elements of Egyptian, Jewish and Vedic religions into their new fake religious masterpiece. Christianity.Next they imported this suicidal religion into Rome using their influence of commerce and banking, to destroy the Roman spirit and Rob that empire blind with the Catholic Church, banking and socialism.  After Rome fell the Catholic Church was spared and they moved on to the rest of Europe.The bible has a total of 66 books. As most of you already know, the habaru powers always emphasize the number 6, as with their 6 million phony Holocaust, 6 million deaths from coronavirus and May Day, important communist holiday [May 1st; 5/1; 5 + 1 = 6], and many more. Be aware of this, especially when watching the news and reading newspapers, magazines, etc. The habarus always emphasize the number 6. This is also corresponds to the kabbalistic Saturn square, which adds up to 15 on all sides and reduces to 6, even the diagonal. In the bible, the number 6 is the number of humanity without any spiritual power. The number 7 has to do with the 7 chakras and spiritual power emanating from these and spiritual perfection. 6 falls short. 6 is also a number of hard labor.

<|endoftext|>***Q:*** **How did our Solar System form?**[In the beginning]( our Sun and the planet Jupiter were alone as a binary system. Then, an L-type brown dwarf known as Saturn and it's 200+ moons arrive. Saturn and Jupiter as well as the larger moons of Saturn then become entangled in a co-linear orbit. This co-linear configuration arrayed the planets **in series** connected like batteries by their north and south poles. In this period, the moons of Saturn (including Mars, Venus, and Earth) enjoyed a [Golden Age]( while the co-linear planetary configuration showered them with a safe carbohydrate energy known as "Mana" that promoted life to form in abundance. This age and configuration are depicted in the Christian Bible as the "Garden of Eden". A similar or identical story of a golden age can be found in [every culture on earth]( The mythical Island of Atlantis appeared at the very center of our North Pole, and fixed above it was our God and Creator: The planet Saturn. The Bible is a real story, just heavily redacted.***Q:*** **Humanity was then cast out of the Garden of Eden?**Correct! It's natural, and happens all the time. When Earth was cast out of Saturn's Garden of Eden into cataclysm, Humanity was struck with a death and darkness that lasted decades. Without the co-linear configuration holding Atlantis in place, it vanishes into the Earth. Our ancestors did not understand why Saturn/El would punish them so. They didn't know at the time but it wasn't God's punishment at all. Instead, being cast out of the Garden of Eden was like a bird being pushed out of a nest by it's parent. It's 100% natural. However, there were some humans (Nimrod etc) who suggested they could get past the darkness by building a tower that goes past the cloud layer.***Q:*** **The Tower of Babel was real??**Back then, Earth's gravity was 1/3rd what it is today but gradually increasing, and there were many Giants, so building the tower was easy. The project was successful at first, and allowed the new religious class called 'scientists' to peer through the cloud layer and spot their old God El/Saturn which they called Moloch. They noticed the Black Cube/Hexagon on Moloch's North Pole and thus began to wear [Yarmulke]( with the 6-sided Star of Moloch on their north poles (their heads). As a result of this discovery, the **class system** was created with those at the top holding secret knowledge, and with those at the bottom slaves to that knowledge. Eventually this project failed, as everyone knows, but it wasn't by God's hand. It was 100% natural. The tower created a circuit connection between the ground and the upper layer of the electromagnetic field of the earth. This connection brought down massive energies along the sides of the tower. All humans within the building or on the staircases were hit with this energy could no longer function, think, talk, or remember anything. The same effect can be achieved in a lab by applying electrodes to a human head. Therefore humans fled the tower in all directions feeling once again smitten by their Creator. Great Job there, Nimrod! This is the first reason the tower failed and the primary reason centralized language became splintered on Earth. The second reason the tower failed is that gravity increased on Earth, and the tower collapsed from within. The secret society cultivated at the top of the Tower of Babel also fled the tower taking their knowledge and culture with them.All Saturn-worshiping secret societies that exist today still attempt to impose upon the rest of the species (us) the class-system rules they created at the top of the [Tower of Babel]( **How do we know all this?**Every [civilization]( on Earth has made monuments to events that occurred in our shared history. The similarities between these monuments (built by independent civilizations that typically never met each-other) provides the strongest evidence of the actual age and history of the Earth.*However, the age of the Earth* ***cannot*** *be determined in Sun-Years.****Q:*** **Why can't the Earth's age be determined in Sun-Years?**Before 202X years ago, the Sun was not visible to the Earth yet. This is why our Gregorian calendars start on this date. Before this date, it was not possible to have a Sun Calendar.***Q:*** **The Sun was not visible to Earth? Pardon me?**Proponents of the [Electric Universe Theory]( challenge the 'Gravity-Centric' model of the universe. They hold that the true story of Earth's origin is that it started out as a Moon of the planet Saturn at a time when Saturn was not yet part of our Sun's orbit. This is why [Solar deities and Sun worship]( can be found throughout most of recorded history in various forms.Here is a **must-see** documentary: [Remembering the End of the World (Full Documentary)]( [

<|endoftext|>The Saturnian cult. It is a cult that has had a huge influence on the New Age spiritualism of today and worships Lucifer!&#x200B;Its members were some of the first Europeans to dabble in practices that are today considered bedrock principles of spirituality: meditation, astrology, working with chakras. But the most lasting legacy of the lodge has been its belief that the benefits of magic have to be earned through the rigorous application of traits like self-discipline and hard work  what today is known as self-help.They practice sex magic and other Aleister Crowley inspired rituals&#x200B;The lodge gathers before the altar, and the members watch as the master of the chair invites a woman, the Priestess, up on stage. They have sex while the other members watch, waiting for the pivotal moment when a live black rooster will be killed, its blood caught and smeared over the master of the chairs body.&#x200B;They hold Luciferian beliefsGetting in contact with Luciferian or Saturn Gnosis may be a life changer, he says It was for me.  And so, Gregoriuss founding belief in the power of Saturn, in discovering that the darkness contains light, continues to impact lives today.  That realization is also what Fraternitas Saturni members mean when they talk about Saturn Gnosis  the ability to draw on the power of a far-off planet in order to steel oneself for the difficult things in life.[Source]( now, the planet Saturn has a huge permanent [hexagon cloud pattern]( over its north pole. Researchers have even claimed to see a [large structure]( towering above it.[A cube can be thought of as a 3d representation of a hexagram.]( The black cube of Saturn is a symbol the Saturnian cults. It also appears in other religions. For instance, [Kaaba]( is built in the center of one of if not the most sacred of Islamic sites. Laid into the corner of the Kaaba is a [black stone]( which many believe to be a meteorite. The whole structure is shaped as a black cube as well.Now a few astronomers are even [claiming to have found an alien base]( on one of Saturn's moons.Maybe there is alien life near Saturn? And maybe this Saturnian cult worships them and believes them to be the ones who will evolve mankind into the next evolutionary step?

<|endoftext|>Obligatory referral to /r/PastSaturnsRings, and my own posts there on reviewing the occult text The Cult of the Black Cube by Arthur Moros. I just put out part 6 today, in fact.
<|endoftext|>Om Sham Shanaye NamahaSo the topic of the Cult of Saturn is a long one. It is hard to talk about without invoking the quality of Saturn, which is not always what we want. First off, one needs to know that a lot of occult information from the west is just totally off or intentionally misleading. To get a better occult foundation, one may want to look into some of the other eastern systems of mysticism when it comes to wanting to actually experience, rather than sit idly by and speculate from a couch. That is the first thing about the occult, there is a big difference between those who know and those who do not know.When it comes to being active on the planes, I do not know in that regard, I am not active on the inner planes. If you do not know what I am referring to, see the book "God Speaks" by Meher Baba for the clearest explanations of the inner planes from a genuine authority.But as someone who has been in the conspiracy world as well as the yogic spiritual underworld, being a professional vedic astrologer, I would like to say that there is a lot of truth to the cult of saturn, but what people do is they mix this up with a lot of other cults going on, if you ask me.The cult of Saturn is similar or like another branch, it appears, of the same luciferian cults we already know about. Lucifer is related to Venus, the morning star, the embodiment of intoxication, the enemy of the Sun, the guru of the asuras, known as Shukra in jyotisha.Venus is the number 6, not Saturn. Saturn is the number 7. So people are really into that damn hexagon thing on the bottom of saturn and everyone whos NOT an occult expert is saying that Saturn rules the number 6, and the 666 stuff is just Saturn.Or maybe this is intentional misinformation, but Saturn is 7 thru and thru, and the whole point is to keep you from getting to the healthy 7, the healthy saturn state. That is where you are free of the matrix and have made peace with everything, and are psychologically whole.They dont want that.They want you staying at the 6 stage, the stage of thirst and desire, the stage of Venus. Six is Venus. Venus rules the 6th day of the week, Saturn the 7th.You know where the word sex comes from? It is latin for six, we all know how Venus rules sex.So Venus is a stage of the rajas guna, (look it up if you need to) the state of passion and Venus is the planet that can drive one to have the nature of a killer in search of their desire. It is also the planet of satisfaction when it is healthy, and the whole point of these cults is to keep our world caught up in an unhealthy Venus/6 state, basically. Hence sex and luxury pushed on us everywhere we look. Anyways, theres so much more to it than all that but Im not sure if anyone here is really interested in this too much or not. I would like to see a better occult foundation in these reddit communities simply bc i would like more people to talk about this stuff too!
<|endoftext|>I don't know who needs to hear this, but "the Jews" is not an answer to everything. How are y'all still falling for the same scapegoat trick that's been used for thousands of years? This is not to say that some of the 'elites' and whatnot are not Jewish. Some certainly are, some aren't. But every single damn conspiracy 'its the Jews!!'. Come on people. Its a tired trope. Its not the jews, blacks, muslims, christians, mexicans, chinese, russians or whoever else is easy to scapegoat for problems in the world. It is those with obscene amounts of money and power with greedy corrupted souls, who view the rest of us as disgusting slaves to experiment on. They abide by no religion or nationality except that of Power (which is fed by money). If we all just suddenly rejected money and went back to the barter system en-masse -- the elites would be swiftly rendered powerless. But money is a very addicting drug- so that would be difficult to accomplish. Anyway- back to Saturn...
<|endoftext|>Some interesting connections to Saturn and the WTC. 
<|endoftext|>it was never saturn alone. most of the cult worshipped was Jupiter. jupiter actually is the cube not saturn. its seems jupiter is more secret than saturn. both both planets correlate to the moon and sun. jupiter to sol, saturn to luna. look at their time spans sun moon circle earth and sat jup circle sun. youll see 12 and 29.  worship saturn when clearly jupiter is the king of the kosmos and host of heavens.
<|endoftext|>Let me introduce myself.I'm a lonely Astrology and Kabbalah student. I make some appointments about Occult Numerology, especially on its symbolism.Let me expose the next: one of the great errors I do behold in all the esoteric exegesis resides on considering the numeric meaning only by the decimal rule. The entire series of ten and each one of the algarisms (up to 10) are considered under the ten counting. That's a primary error, I consider, even if not intentional.All the secret numerology does not resolve itself by meditating on decimal basis, but on ternary and senary bases, exactly as we can verify as meditating on numbers as 7, 9, 21 and 33.About Saturn, there is a lot to investigate, especially because of the three (from Etz Chaiyim) and the Six from hexagon. Six is 10 in senary basis, 20 in ternary basis and 110 in binary basis.
<|endoftext|>I'm way too late to contribute to the thread discussion but here's my observation anyway:Black monolith/cube (not sure if they're the same thing) are sometimes hinted at in TV shows and movies.Most recently I've got to watching two movie/tv which involved a black cuboid object.In Agents of Shield it was part of a major storyline in season 3 (I think). The monolith was actually a teleportation device to another planet. (i'm still watching it so no spoilers please!)There was a movie I watched recently on Netflix called 2036: Origin Unknown. It was about an AI monitoring a space mission to Mars which ended in disaster and we later learn its because AI discovered a black cube on Mars, upon further investigation the cube suddenly disappears and appears in Antarctica. Again it was some kind of teleportation device.Could they be hinting that the black cube is actually a teleportation device?Back in the real world, there's a black cube in the mediation room at the United Nations in New York. It was supposedly designed to be used by all faiths instead of having separate prayer rooms for each faith. Why they chose the black cube as the main focus of the room is unknown. Just spitballing here...could all our world religions originate from the black cube/monolith so the cube in the room was symbolic representation of that?I even came across a website article about a black building in front of the twin towers in NY. It's in the shape of a monolith and some people think that this Millenium Hilton Hotel building is actually symbolic and that it means something. Who knows. If my memory serves me correctly the movie 2001 Space Odessey with the famous monolith was created in the same year the twin towers started construction and the same year the 911 phone number was created. Many years later the black monolith building was built in front of the twin towers. Then 9/11 happened. Lots of symbolism going on here.There's the black stone in mecca. Even though its not in the shape of a cube or monolith could've it been a piece broken off the original black monolith? The Kaaba where the stone is housed is coincidentally in the shape of a cube and is sometimes dressed all in black but they do change the dressing of the kaaba from time to time.There's also black cuboid artwork in public locations around the world.I have no idea if the black monolith actually exist in real life or it did exist once upon a time. Whatever the reason the idea of the black cube/monolith seems to have worked it way into the fabric of society and we're seeing hints all over the place. It seems important but we don't know why.

<|endoftext|>Ok hear me out.  I have been discovering and learning about astrology and such.  I am no expert and my perception is probably biased, but I am open to discuss about it.Is there a correlation between the fact that people have a strong Saturn in their chart and the way they are ? e.g. A strong Saturn in the chart might increase tendencies of people to the occult, to the mind and spiritual for good and for bad. I'd say... for the self. If anyone has some input on the latter, feel free to participate.

<|endoftext|>I haven't followed the link or read anything here, yet am going to post my jumbled addition:-Your masters don't actually worship any celestial bodies.They often use Aries aspects such as Emperor(Tarot)/Mars/Iron/Blood/Fire/War/Forge [aka "doctor": alter from original condition to changed condition. Consider this before ever visiting a "Worshipful Society of Apothecaries" petro-chem poisoner] in a lot of their symbolism and ritual - as with a lot of fire effects used in their "ISIS" movie fakes. The "War" thing is a deliberate misinterpretation by the Romans of the original Greek. Ar[i]es means "battle", not war. Battle is not an act of aggression. In fact it's a reference to "the battle in the house of life"They use "Iron" in a lot of their shit too: "Iron Mountain"/"Iron Curtain"/"Iron Lady"/"Iron Dome" [the latter is a mere firework display used to terrorise their Israel-supplanted Hebrew bitches - that they hate so much - into believing they are genuinely under persistent rocket attack.I have an original 295 year old book (1725) with a couple of quotes regarding our masters' disdain and vilification of the "Jews" over all others; in which the author supposes it is because they wouldn't bow to Chaldean "priestcraft" and its elevation of the priesthood to a gatekeeper class that you had to submit to while they peddled many false gods. Papacy, anyone? The "Jews" kept the original spiritual books and got the fuck away. It also mentions that our masters - whom the author refers to as "Imaginers" - "NEVER FORGIVE". A clue for the modern era?Your masters are materialist gatekeepers.If they worship anything it's the material-producing vagina, as evidenced in their "Lady of Guadalupe" idolatry, and the vagina that Muslims kiss in their black Saturn cube that they encircle in rings.Also, I've seen images of so-called "Jews" wearing the cube on their forehead. These people are compromised. The significance of this is the blocking of wisdom and intuition by materialism, as symbolised by Aries'/Tyr and Sagittarius arrow glyphs, and also spears and staffs in popular occult fiction: Gandalf's staff, Star Wars' lightsabers and even Sgt. Elias' (/Elijah: Redeemer|destroyer) torch as he investigates the tunnels in Platoon.They own you and determine - through all tools - what condition you live in and die in, and how and when this happens.Materialism is relation to the feminine physical manifestation (bisexual*) which is governed by Venus/Lucifer (copper), the Moon (magnetism) and Saturn/Satan (time|space).*FYI, the "Jesus" narrator is, in opposition, asexual and related to god (which my copy of the "Hermetica" refers to as the "first principle"). This is related to the masculine spiritual infusion.You see, god is not manifest, and can only be witnessed through expression of the laws of nature. God is the singularity, whereas every physical creation in this material (Satanic) realm is dual - in that it requires an opposite for definition. This is gnosticism, and is what all spiritual books originally were before our masters had their slaves read them LITERALLY as HISTORICAL DOCUMENT. It is a misconception that our masters are gnostics. They have simply stolen and used gnosticism - and its universal unlocking keys - to rule over the earth with their Assyrian BULL[ god ]SHIT.The black cube represents time|space and material captivity (dense material allows not even light to escape)The "Star Trek" reference to "The Borg" and "You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile" is a joke's-on-you reference to our masters' House of Borgia/Borjaps. The reason I always put "Jews" in quotes is that the biblical reference to jews is a reference to internal bodily disciplines aka disciples. The place we refer to as "Egypt" was not originally named so. It has been renamed - as the Hebrews have - to obfuscate the true meaning in the gnostic universal instruction manual known as "THE Books" [emphasis added by me to denote that no others are necessary]. The bible never states that Jews are people. "chosen" disciplines [invoke Jesus - their metaphorical king] to no longer be slaves to the sensory material body. I won't go more into bibilical translation. It's long and difficult.pps. The primary control mechanism is language and its mis/interpretation.How deep does the rabbit hole go? You think thoughts to yourself using their words that you believe you know the meaning of.After language, control is handed to abuse of money - materialism's moon-eye [BIS], trade [Livery] and law [BAR]. Those three are the fuckers that closed the world down except their own evil Masonic-run corporations.

<|endoftext|>please all of you go read about astrotheology, basically all religions and myths share a mytheme of watching the stars from which we create all our cultural narratives. planetary astrology/astronomy is very real. you can argue all you want about Jesus, but Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, The Sun, the Moon, Venus, etc are really there and they do crete influence through frequency resonance, like Earth is 10' (Schumann resonance, which is created from the friction between Earths atmosphere moving across the outer shell of the planet). Fixed star astrology (yes, the planets move, but the stars are static in place) is the relationship between Stars and Planet placements in time. all religions, cults, etc are sourced from this material, as Saturn was the Royal (Crown = Coronated = Corona = Saturns Rings) source of power, Saturn itself is known as the Rule maker, the malefic paternal figure (tho also an Androgyne), and Jupiter is the benefic /good son of Saturn where we source the whole Jesus concept. It's a lot to explain if you're interested, so go read a booky-wook.

<|endoftext|>I haven't started this rabbit hole, but in college in between studying actual science I dabbled in astrology. I can tell you that Saturn is considered a maleficent planet. It conveys restriction, but also discipline. It's influence is considered difficult, and your "Saturn return" when Saturn returns to the position it was in when you were born is usually a time your life that is marked with difficulties and setbacks.Anyway, just FYI, Saturn has traditionally been considered a "baddie" unlike Jupiter which conveys expansion, philosophy, travel etc...I think there is an underlying scientific reason for astrology and that even though it's not an actual science, it could be that it's just beyond our comprehension now... For instance we know that the moon controls the tides, perhaps micro-gravitational influences from planets affect us?
<|endoftext|>Look up the electric universe theory, theres an informative documentary on YouTube called Symbols of an alien sky. That documentary posits that at one point Saturn was positioned between us and the sun, and that between us and Saturn were Venus and Mars. Its a deep dive which leads one to this other theory called Catastrophism. This idea that around every 12,000 years a global catastrophe resets human civilizations on the surface. Check out the YouTube channel Suspiciousobservers. Tres wild!
<|endoftext|>I'm pretty sure that "sun" is the name of our star. There are other stars out there, but not other suns.
<|endoftext|>Science loves labeling things from a human perspective. Isn't the simple explanation that our sun is what we base our observations of other stars on? And regarding Saturn, wouldn't that make it an anomaly if it was a star in the past?
<|endoftext|> And the persistent theories that perhaps our Sun is really part of a binary star system. This could maybe have to do with Saturn as an ex-star as well. This theory makes a lot of sense when thinking about the precession of the equinoxes as well. The accepted theory is that, due to a slow wobble in earths rotation our equinoxes shift about 1 degree every 72 years and take about 25,772 years to complete a cycle. I personally think it makes more sense that our sun is part of a binary star system and takes 25,772 years to complete its orbit around this other star. Binary stars are quite common in the universe (Sirius A and B for example) so this explanation seems more likely than the "axial precession" as far as I can tell.
<|endoftext|> I believe that part of this theory is that Saturn used to be Earth's sun. Which I don't discount as a possibility.No. Just flat out no. It's not massive enough to fuse hydrogen and never was. The smallest main sequence star we're aware of (EBLM J055557Ab) is 285 more massive than Saturn.I have always found it odd that our 'Sun' has no official scientific name. All other stars are named with a particular system in astrophysics. But ours is just 'Sun', 'Sol', or 'Solis'. Weird because science loves labeling everything.What's wrong with the labels "Sun" or "Sol"? The point of naming things precisely is to avoid potential confusion. I don't think anyone's confused here.Besides, the various "systematic" naming schemes for stars are based on which constellation those stars are in and often only applies for visible or near visible stars, since these systems were developed hundreds of years ago when it was feasible to name all the stars they saw. Newer "unnamed" stars might have some designation that's vaguely descriptive then gives a coordinate in the sky, but that's a temporary designation. Official names are designated by the IAU, who try to choose "traditional" names where possible (e.g. Alpha Centauri A is officially Rigel Kentaurus), and no, you can't spend money to name a star, those companies are scams.And the persistent theories that perhaps our Sun is really part of a binary star system. This could maybe have to do with Saturn as an ex-star as well.It isn't and it wasn't. We'd notice a second star nearby. Even that smallest star would cause noticeable orbital perturbations on the outer planets. Remember that Neptune was identified largely based on discrepancies between the predicted orbit of Uranus and the actual observations of Uranus (to the point where one astronomer was able to *calculate* where it would be).Also randomly- on January 19, 2020, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky tweeted 'Despite climate alarmist predictions, humans will likely survive for hundreds of millions of years into the future. In the meantime, we should begin creating atmospheres on suitable moons or planets.' He then tweeted, 'With so many billionaires about, why not a private prize of $10 million for the scientist who genetically creates an O2 producing organism that will thrive in the frigid, methane lakes of Titan [Saturn's moon]?'First off, Rand Paul is either willfully or actually ignorant about the fate of humanity. First off, climate change is real.But even if it weren't, it's incredibly arrogant to suggest that humanity will likely survive for hundreds of millions of years when we've had *multiple* close calls of civilization ending nuclear weapons exchanges in the last few decades, technology is only getting more dangerous, and even if humanity somehow doesn't manage to kill itself there's all sorts of possibilities of natural ends of humanity. Sometime within the next million years we'll probably see a supervolcano explosion (the last one nearly wiped humanity out). Every 100 million years or so we get an asteroid roughly the size of the one that killed the dinosaurs. And over the next 600 million years the sun will get brighter and brighter, which will increase crustal erosion, leading to lower CO2 concentration, until eventually plants will no longer be able to survive.But sure, we should definitely expand outside of Earth. That's pretty clear. But setting aside the ethical and scientific considerations involved in any plan to just blast genetically microorganisms to some planet to terraform it, if he thought a $10 million prize were sufficient, it seems far easier and more direct to just do it with a government prize. Or just, you know, fund research (and stop pillorying research that he clearly doesn't understand for political points).
<|endoftext|> I have always found it odd that our 'Sun' has no official scientific name.I know what you mean, but theres a perfectly reasonable explanation for that: human acknowledgement of the Sun predates science by millennia. In fact, its a relatively recent development in human history that we first realized the Sun is an example of a star  that all stars are suns. We still call it *the* Sun because old habits die hard.And the persistent theories that perhaps our Sun is really part of a binary star system. This could maybe have to do with Saturn as an ex-star as well.Youre close to an actual scientific theory  that Saturn (and Jupiter) is a [failed star]( an object that at one point had the potential to become a star but that was ultimately too small. Binary systems are relatively common, and so (we believe) are gas giants.
<|endoftext|>Makes sense if you look at christian mythos as an alegory and Saturn is Satan, his fall from grace was literally Saturn losing its status as a sun and human consciousness tripping out on like dmt and space frequencies interpreting it as god casting out his highest sun. its then even more intersting because Saturn broadcasts a frequency of 666 at earth which sounds like a chorus of screams.I honestly dont know how to interpret this but I like the idea that Saturn got too big for its britches and got cast down and is now throwing a temper tantrum causing suffering and misery in our world until it is restored as a star.My best guess is that a lot of mythological stories are allegories for quantum physiscs and other cosmic occurances that effect human consciousness so that we can easily understand what happened without having the science to literally interpret it but moreover both the scientific and the spiritual are one and the same and neither version is more correct the most important thing is reconciling the two to create a more harmonious picture because if you look at everything with a scientific lens you are going to assume that humanity is just a collection of cells and theres no such thing as soul and that leads to a lot of suffering bloodshed violence and just generally greed/selfishness based off ignorance and fear.

<|endoftext|>Saturn is too small, apparently, according to science anyway. Same with Jupiter but our sun may have a twin, there seems to be something on the fringes of our solar system, at least the gravity anomalies are suggesting that. Some astrophysicists have even said it could be a primordial black hole, which would be very small
<|endoftext|>In most occult book, the sun name is Helios, it's a fire living entity fully conscious on its own level. With my personal meditation and weird third eye experience, that's plausible.
<|endoftext|>I'm a big Ron Paul fan... Havent followed Rand too much...But either way that idea of calling on private organizations to genetically create or modify an organism with the goal of sending it to seed a moon or planet is absolutely batshit crazy. We don't even know what is there, and you want to land genetically modified organisms on it with the goal of proliferating life??? smh.
<|endoftext|>That IS a super interesting tweet.Unfortunately these things have already been colonized.By not so friendly entities.Billionaire claims to have visited Mars and yet no one takes him seriously.[ you ask? Idk, ask John Carpenter.[ (did not time stamp cause the entire clip is worth watching)
<|endoftext|>our sun has no name...proceeds to list names of our sun...If you ride through the desert on a horse with no name, does that imply you used to be riding a camel!?(Also, there is a **long** list of names for our sun throughout history, Ra being one of them.)
<|endoftext|>You're confusing masonic pseudoscience with reality. Planets and outerspace don't exist. Everything in the sky is a star, revolving around us. The sun being glorified as the center of the universe (sun worship).Now, try your post again with that understanding.
<|endoftext|>So Senator Paul thinks it's possible to change the atmospheres of OTHER celestial bodies, but not Earth?
<|endoftext|> give this a read. Very relevant.
<|endoftext|>Has anyone actually seen this hexagram shaped storm on Saturn or are we just taking NASAs word for it?
<|endoftext|>Well that would be great if Saturn did relate to 6 astrologically and not 7, which is what he relates to intimately, which is a well known occult fact. He rules the 7th day of the week, the day God rests, as Saturn rules rest in astrology. He rules the number 7, not 6, which Venus rules. You are mistaking a lot of the venus/lucifer #6 cult with Saturn, and this is understandable as these planets are friends in astrology. Saturn is exalted in the 7th sign, not the 6th. Saturn rules the western direction, the direction of the 7th house, where the Sun sets, and goes to die. Each planet in astrology gets a dig bala or directional strength, a house where it is strongest in, and Saturns is strongest in the 7th, not the 6th. Venus is the number 6, hence sex, ruled by venus, is latin for 6.These are basic occult principles. One has to be careful when learning occult knowledge from the internet in 2020, so dont take my word for it, but I am a professional astrologer who actually does do predictions and all. All the stuff you are saying is still relevant but to Venus, the planet of lust and desire, and the enemy of the Sun....that might give you a good direction to look into. Learn about the avasthas of the planets, and how the Sun and Venus are mutual enemies, but Venus and Saturn are mutual friends. There is so much more to this than the conspiracy world knows so it can almost be frustrating to be an astrologer and participate in this debate here, its like where to begin?
<|endoftext|>nice of Jordan Jordan Maxwell to drop in. speaking of blockchain, buy chainlink, the money you make will be useful for fighting back
<|endoftext|>Are you familiar with Comyns Beaumont? We have very good reason to believe all that history actually happened in the British Isles...
<|endoftext|>I responded to this a few days ago. Not sure what happened to my comment.Anyway, I it was about the Iberes (Hebrews), and how they were originally located in the British Isles. I believe Beaumont's Cometary Catastrophe is very relevant to your theory.
<|endoftext|>That was really interesting- thanks for sharing! I've really started liking the EUT in the past few years. This was a great synopsis of how it ties into the Saturn cult and the Solar worship as well.
<|endoftext|>Thats very interesting, thank you for sharing. Where would I learn more about this idea of the sun and jupiter being binary stars originally? And what did you mean by before 202x years ago the sun wasnt visible? I dont fully understand that part or why we would think that? Will check out that doc
<|endoftext|>Would we be correct in saying the British Isles were positioned in that central location you mention in first point?Are you suggesting a meteor disturbed the co-linear orbit, causing a cometary impact, resulting in the flood?Do you believe the "secret knowledge" could've been gunpowder? The British Isles are absolutely covered in mines of various metal ores.The title of your doc intrigues me, as I believe the Book of Revelations was in fact a memory, not a warning. It most probably was a memory of a cometary impact with our planet, that would've happened around the British Isles, with all the evidence to prove it.
<|endoftext|>It sort of does in a sense, but not directly related to the cult stuff, more just astrologically, Saturn is the planet of "bearing our cross" in the world. He has the most enemies in astrology, sun, mars, and moon. Whereas no other planet has 3 enemies and only 2 friends.Saturn rules bearing our burdens down here on the planet earth and working out our most difficult karmas. So the cross at the top and the little tail or sickle swinging down to earth symbolizes coming down. It symbolizes descending, like how saturn is strongest in the "descendant" the 7th house, the house where the sun is setting. Again why Saturn is the 7 and not 6 as many people are thinking lately.Note that jupiter, the planet of grace and spiritual upliftment is the opposite symbol, with the cross down, and the sickle tail thingy swinging one up into the heavens. The sickle aspect also connects to saturn as the grim reaper/old father time aspect.
<|endoftext|> They practice sex magic and other Aleister Crowley inspired ritualsSaturn Gnosis  P-R Koenig is partisan and seems to have a grudge against the OTO and the Fraternitas Saturni. Nevertheless nearly all the original source documentation is in German and if you do not read German his English web pages seem to be the best we have got. Also heresiarchs do present facts. Just take his interpretations of the facts with a skeptical antidote. The guy who did the artwork for the original Nosferatu movie was a FS so if nothing else you can find some trivia to impress the unwashed masses if the bars and clubs ever re-open. : )
<|endoftext|>"The black cube of Saturn is a symbol the Saturnian cults. It also appears in other religions. For instance, [Kaaba]( is built in the center of one of if not the most sacred of Islamic sites. Laid into the corner of the Kaaba is a [black stone]( which many believe to be a meteorite. The whole structure is shaped as a black cube as well."What is your point exactly? What connection are you attempting to make between Islam and "Saturnian cults" and Luciferianism?Muslims believe the Kaaba as it currently stands was built by Prophet Abraham and his son Prophet Ishmael, peace be upon them both.The Kaaba itself is just a [brick building]( The cloth that covers it, called kiswah, both protects it from the elements and beautifies it. The cloth has come in [many different colors]( over time, including white, red and green, and is currently black with verses of the Qur'an embroidered all over it in gold thread.Muslims worship the Creator of all creation, and when we pray to Him, we pray facing the first house built for the purpose of worshipping Him, the Kaaba, as we are commanded to [in the Qur'an]( We see you O Prophet turning your face towards heaven. Now We will make you turn towards a direction of prayer that will please you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque in Meccawherever you are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture certainly know this to be the truth from their Lord. And Allah is never unaware of what they do."To be clear, while Muslims consider the Kaaba to be a sacred place that we deeply respect, our worship is directed toward the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth and all that is within it; we do not worship the Kaaba, and we do not worship Lucifer or Satan (rather we seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the reject), and we do not worship the Roman deity Saturn or the planet Saturn or any other deity associated with the planet Saturn.Islam is a monotheistic religion, and the foundation of our religion upon which everything else relies is the concept of our Creator being One God, as opposed to one of many gods."[Tawheed]( (Arabic:  tawd, meaning 'unification or oneness of God') is the indivisible oneness concept of monotheism in Islam. Tawheed is the religion's central and single most important concept, upon which a Muslim's entire faith rests. It unequivocally holds that God is One (Al-Aad) and Single (Al-Wid)."Tawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of faith. The first part of the shahada (the Islamic declaration of faith) is the declaration of belief in the oneness of God. To attribute divinity to anything or anyone else, is shirk  an unpardonable sin according to the Qur'an, if repentance is not sought afterwards. Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawheed."I'm always astounded at how readily some people lump Islam in with Saturn-worshipping pagans merely because the greatest house of worship we have is a building that is as tall as it is wide and is, in recent times, covered with a black, white, gold and silver cloth. Like...in spite of everything else our religion is about, that's enough for people to declare Islam a religion of Satan/Saturn worship? Come on, guys. Dig a little deeper before making such claims.
<|endoftext|>Here is an article that was removed from Forbes about Neanderthal DNA that you might be interested in then: [
<|endoftext|>It's not "the Jews," like, I don't think my next-door neighbor in my tiny apartment complex is complicit. It's moreso "Isreal."
<|endoftext|>And what? It's downright ignorant to think that the elites would "swiftly be rendered powerless" if the system reverted or changed in any way...and it's ignorant to think that it ever was like that.
<|endoftext|>If we went back to the bartering system, a lot of people would die, so not really an option and people are somewhat aware of it, which is why they fight to protect the system that allows them to have so much. I'm sure you do, too, because it's better than wiping your ass with leaves and not knowing when you're going to eat.
<|endoftext|>You're kind of partly there but you'll still get attacked for stating something like that.It's not only the Sun.The Sun provides the source, the Moon weaves our material existence. We're fucked without both. Don't believe any of their shit about what either entity is comprised of, where they are located* and what they do.*This requires explanation in its own post. It relates to space being void and, therefore physical sensory rules do not apply. Any "speed of light" only applies when traveling through material. Atmosphere is gaseous material. Across voids, light travels instantaneously.The sun is still physical and the male parent. The moon is the female parent. The sun and moon - as we physically experience them - are a pair of electric life and magnetic death [what was that, Metallica?!]. The balance between them is the earth with spawned us, which we are part of and can never leave, as we are still bound without visible roots.This is the issue with sun worship. It is technically still material worship under time|space Saturn. God is omnipresent and can only be evidenced in operation.What's stupid though, is that those Yankee-doodle dumb-fuck evangelicals - who call out the Vatican for sun worship - are themselves reading their bibles in a literal/historical/material sun-worship fashion (in accordance with Vatican designs)... under their own claimed nemesis, "Satan".
<|endoftext|>I believe I saw something that said that they were muddling the two to obfuscate.Saturn represents the time|space gnostic co-dependency. You measure each concept using the other. Both could be fallacy, yet going into deep philosophy will inevitably end up nowhere.Do you realise that most every day scientific concepts that we take for granted are unverifiable and unquantifiable.Jupiter is "the god" of the planetary "gods" and represents insight/intuition/wisdom (aka "sophia"... of philoSOPHy)
<|endoftext|>So can gravity, psychedelic hallucinations, the arrow of time, etc., but does having a scientific explanation for these things really make them less interesting and mysterious? Where will the novelty and intrigue we feel for the wonders of our world go if every question or challenge to the paradigm is scoffed at and discarded because it can be scientifically explained? Should a child stifle their wonder and awe over, say, the beauty and complexity of a butterflys wing because we know scientifically why their wings are this way?  We conspiracy theorists are at our core truth-seekers. Maybe we would get closer to finding the truth if we didnt so casually dismiss any claim that seems a bit weird to us.  It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. -(not Aristotle as I previously thought, but a good quote nonetheless).  Edit: [Its also worth noting that scientific findings can also be falsified for a third partys agenda if they have the cash.](

<|endoftext|>At the link you provided, it says:"The black cube is a part of Jewish, Muslim, and Masonic tradition"I just have to say, for the record, "the black cube" is not part of the Islamic faith. It's so exhausting to see this accusation and have to refute it over and over again. I knew as soon as I saw the chosen topic of this Conspiracy Round Table that this would come up.To be clear, the Kaaba itself is just a [brick building]( The cloth that covers it, called kiswah, both protects it from the elements and beautifies it. The cloth has come in [many different colors]( over time, including white, red and green, and is currently black with verses of the Qur'an embroidered all over it in gold thread. Black cubes are not a symbol in our religion; the color of the cloth over the building has no bearing at all in our faith. If tomorrow it was decided that the next time the cloth is replaced it's going to be completely silver, or white, or gold, or green...no one would be upset.Furthermore, the Kaaba does not "represent" the planet Saturn or a deity associated exclusively with the planet Saturn. Muslims believe the Kaaba as it currently stands was built by Prophet Abraham and his son Prophet Ishmael, peace be upon them both, for the purpose of worshipping the Creator of all that exists; the planets are merely creations of our Creator, and it would not be befitting for our Creator to be symbolically represented by something He created.With that said, it's high time that people start actually researching things instead of honing in on one superficial supposed commonality between otherwise unrelated things and using that to lump them all in together into some elaborate, nonsensical theory.Like...the gist of what is being said at that link you posted is:"The planet Saturn has a hexagon on it and if you draw some lines, hexagons look like cubes and so when cubes are black, they represent the planet Saturn, and Saturn is the planet associated with the Roman deity Saturn and the Greek Titan Kronos but both of them are really Satan, so anytime you see a black cube, it really means Satan worship!!!"And also we're living in a simulation and our spirits are trapped in a false reality that we can only escape through gaining secret (occult?) knowledge! Nevermind how that sounds like a lie from Satan; the ancient Gnostics said it and the Matrix trilogy confirms it so I think we're really onto something here!"Also, if we don't understand this unspecified secret knowledge, we'll be forced to reincarnate over and over again for some reason! How that in any way has anything to do with Judaism and Islam (in which they believe you live once, die, and then either go to Heaven or Hell) beats me, but dude, some Jews wear those little black hat things and Muslims put a black cloth over a cube-shaped building they worship around so it all makes sense!!! BLACK CUBES!!!!!"There are some PROBLEMS going on with that dude's theory, man. Some problems. I love this part:"But how did the ancients know Saturn had a hexagon on top of it? How could they possibly make all of these associations without telescopes and satellites? Some theorists believe in the very distant past the planets were arranged much differently. This would have been back in the Golden Age, when sh-- was good and Saturn wasnt pissed off from hearing that prophecy yet. Supposedly this was when Atlantis thrived and Saturn hung stationary in the sky directly overhead."Ah! But of course! The ol' rearranging of the universe! /facepalm/For ya'll's mental health, ya can't be walkin' around thinking you live in a simulation, trapped here by "an ignorant and flawed god", and only able to be freed from the simulation (to go where and do what?) by researching esoteric "transcendent knowledge" that releases the [Divine Spark]( within you. You are not divine, divinity does not lie within you, God is not inside of you, you can not be one with God by reading cryptic texts, you cannot transcend matter by researching incoherent theories written by other confused human beings, there is no such thing as reincarnation and there never was and never will be, and you are not in a false reality created by a flawed god.The Creator of this world is without flaw, and He is the source of all knowledge and wisdom, only some of which He has shared with us. He created this world and He created us and He is testing us to see the quality of our characters. There will be a Day on which we are informed about that which we used to do, and our good deeds and bad deeds will be weighed against each other, and that will determine whether we will be rewarded with Paradise or punished with Hellfire.Why are people running from this simple truth and inventing all of these complicated, nonsensical alternate stories and explanations? What does one gain from deluding oneself in that manner? And why try to smear the Abrahamic religions by dragging them into it? I truly don't get any of this. It's totally bizarre.These ill-conceived fantasies are not getting anyone who delves into them any closer to the truth, but rather causing them to drift farther away from it. Some of what I read at that link irritated me, some of it elicited actual chuckles (more like a "heh"), but at the end I honestly just felt sad that some people are spending their time on ideas like this and actually taking it to heart. :-/

<|endoftext|>As a side note, Saturn's poles are hexagonal, 6 is the number of "bad". Saturn is also one of the dimmest and grimmest in appearance, of the visible planets, which may also contribute to it's negative connotations in astrology and mythology.Happy to see there are other astrology enthusiasts on this sub.
<|endoftext|>Saturn is the ruler of Aquarius and we are entering out of the Piscean age into that of Aquarius. Jupiter rules Pisces. Saturn is very constrictive and yes, many Saturnian cults exist. What do we think Christmas is, but a co optation of Saturnalia?
<|endoftext|>Astrology was people's first attempts at logical thinking. They just had bad logic and understanding, though.Can't really blame them, they tried the best they could with the technology they had at the time.And no to gravitational effects from planets like Saturn or Jupiter. I'm sure you could probably find some kind of disturbance in the Earth's orbital path due to those planets being in certain positions, but nothing noticeable like the tide coming in.
<|endoftext|>perhaps micro-gravitational influences from planets affect us?Definitely within the realm of possibility, though also definitely beyond the perception of the herd.

There are like 50 posts in the series.
<|endoftext|>listening to magicians of the gods right now. makes an extremely compelling case for the younger dryas impact hypothesis
<|endoftext|>12000 years ago the planet entered a zone where there's a higher chance of meteor impact. The people groups who lived at the time were as varied as we currently are on the planet. Groups who live in the jungle, with little to no contact with the rest of the world who has rocket ships and satellites. This meteor impact happened over Greenland and vaporized obscene amounts of water causing nearly instantaneous flooding and rain for a very long time. The remnants of society remembers this through mythology and "hidden" knowledge inscribed in the monoliths and stories passed on for thousands of years. The procession of the planets helped map out times for when the earth would enter these areas in the solar system where the risk of meteor impact is much higher than it is on average.
<|endoftext|>Yes. Our star is called Sol. Or the sun.That's why our star system is called the solar system. There is only one solar systems.All other systems are called Star Systems not solar systems. Yes I like labelling things, or as I call it, naming things as to easily identify them. Lol.
<|endoftext|>Yes, because the sky was supposed to have appeared purple instead of blue. That just reminded me though- you know what else was supposed to cause purple skies and waters? The Canfield Ocean. During previous mass-extinctions on earth.  I wonder if the two tales are woven together somehow.
<|endoftext|>True. I'm probably making too much of it. Saturn would definitely be an anomaly if it turned out to be a past star. In Roman mythology (based on Greek version), Saturn is one of the Titans. He hears a prophecy that one of his sons would overthrow him, (just as he had overthrown his father, Caelus). To prevent this, Saturn ate his children. His wife was horrified obviously and hid his third son, Jupiter, on the island of Crete. She gave Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling instead and he ate that. Jupiter eventually did go on to kill Saturn and rescue his siblings from the belly, just as the prophecy predicted.This seems to be where the bad vibes for Saturn in astrology come from, and the good vibes for Jupiter.
<|endoftext|>No.We use telescopes, mathematics and techniques like paralax to observe, categorize and record other star systems. You're thinking of Helioseismology.
<|endoftext|>Ha agreed. And I definitely think myths were exactly what you said, a way to explain what is going on without all the scientific details. And yes, science and spiritual are one. They got separated during the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution, but it is important to bring them together again. As you said, it creates the harmony the humankind is currently missing. Also why science thinks our minds can be replaced by AI and robots. They are missing Consciousness and the Soul. --Great comment!

<|endoftext|>I would say that Lucifer is much better described as the 3. When you look at the heavenly bodies the third brightest is venus after the sun and moon. This ties in to the holy Trinity idea as well as the 1/3 of angels cast down from heaven. This is where the 333 is coming from 1/3 = .333. so Freemasonry is the embodiment of lucifer and Satan is the 666. 666+333 = 999 so now your short 1. The one is the power of God, the power of perfection or the power of you. You believing in the 666 333 system is what makes it real. That's the idea of the One from the matrix movie.
<|endoftext|>Was there also not another planet, Tiamat, on the other sidein relation to usof Mars?I'm talking, of course, about Phaeton. We have eye witness accounts of a "god shivering into thousands of pieces and falling to earth," causing great calamity, including plagues, and, in particular, a tremendous flood, all circa 13,000 years ago.
<|endoftext|>Also, love your user name. Also, just read your planes anti-gravity thing. Another very interesting theory. You have a very clear way of explaining things. I will consider that plane theory further. Sorry you have so many downvotes!! But who really cares about made-up Reddit karma either. Glad you randomly decided to post a comment today.
<|endoftext|>Thanx! Youd be surprised how many people see it and want to talk to me about the Illuminati and the matrix lolol
<|endoftext|>Im not linking islam to any of the luciferian stuff. I was bringing up that most religions even islam have some aspect of Saturn imagery. Not really connecting dots there just bringing up things I 've noticed.
<|endoftext|>In my research I have found that almost all religions and mythologies worship Lucifer and or Satan in some way or another. Being raised a Jehovahs Witness, I was a little shocked to learn that the names for god in the Old Testament were actually the names of gods and Yahweh was a name Satan adopted shortly after Baal hadad and before or while reigning in Egypt as Amun Ra. Footprints of His influence and the paganism can be seen in almost every religion, he truly is the master of deception.
<|endoftext|>I think you took one singular piece of one sentence, stopped reading, and vastly misinterpreted what was actually driving at.
<|endoftext|>Can't have children to sacrifice without the act of procreation.Sex sells. Sex gives life onto which the elite sacrifice and "benefit" from.
<|endoftext|>Its also interesting how the Saturn/black cube thing comes up so much. The color black is related to Saturn in all the astrological traditions around the world, I am pretty sure. The cube is often related to the earth element in occult symbolism, and Saturn rules one of the earth signs and is related to the earth element, although mainly to the wind element. Saturn is basically the planet that an astrologer looks at to read the trauma in ones life, or the degree of trauma that one will experience, and their resistance to it. Saturn strong, say exalted in libra, indicates a strong ability to deal with the trauma and sufferring of life without being psychologically ruined by it. Saturn afflicted, otherwise.So it might also be that the saturn cults are worshipping saturn in the sense that they are worshipping their own negative trauma, with this somehow being of benefit to them spiritually on the negative path. Or it may be that they know that certain mathematical percentages of the population are bound to be susceptible to these symbols triggering some sort of trauma that they can feed off of or benefit from.
<|endoftext|>Actually, all symbolism and numerology are neutral.It's context and how they're used which is important.
<|endoftext|>that was a great read, thank you for sharing. How do you know it was removed from Forbes though? It doesnt say that in this article from what I can tell, and this site has mainly stuff in another language so im kinda confused? I would like to share this with others
<|endoftext|>DNA is bullshit. All your masters' historical lies are bullshit. These stories are to set you up with bullshit ideas about our origins and destinies - the narrative of which will be controlled by the same masters.
<|endoftext|>Just saying money gives people a lot of power. But money in itself is totally value-less. So why give value to something made up that gives other people power over you?
<|endoftext|>its based of vibration and resonance. you know pla ets resonate and make the same patterns as in cymatics. thats quantifiable and verified! the ancients knew it by the OM and many cultures had sacred knowledge only science has re verified these old forgotten concepts. now think jupiter os the planet that died and returned not saturn. when the sun exploded it cast him out only for jupiter to return and be even stronger than the sun! how? does it not push the sun out of its baricenter? nibiru had returned long ago. is not the picese not connected with jupiter? are they not 12 and 29 like the moon and sun? the oldest god known if you look is uranus. it was ripped into two when jupiter returned also ripping planets and moons away from saturn. those scientific theories are just remakes of greek and more ancient secret myths about natures mechanics. i believe it was just the sun, saturn system. saturn being the suns moon. jupiter came to be the son of the sun god and circle earth in 12 yrs like months of the sun and freed us from saturn and gave us a moon. the helio center saturn jupiter matrix is a copy of the geocentric moon and sun matrix by way of resonance and cosmic balance.
<|endoftext|>Oh yeah he shared that divine knowledge with your prophet who loved sticking his weewee between young childrens legs. Also if you want to talk about occult symbolism in Islam, look no further than the crescent moon/eclipse which is perhaps the oldest occult representation of duality in the world. I honestly dont know how any of you (Jews, Muslims, or Christians) could read those three books and not understand that theyre purposefully written to be similar enough and yet different enough to get you to kill each other for over a thousand years. I also find it comical how you can say that for certain after you die youre going to hell or heaven, and then in the next sentence laugh at people for denying this simple truth. Do you know what truth means? You have literally no evidence for your claim whatsoever, and still feel confident enough to laugh at others for questioning it. Thats next level confusion. But oh right I forgot its divine and unquestionable and that answers everything . Ill give you something. The books absolutely contain high levels of knowledge and insight into the human condition. They helped humans learn a sense of morality. They also, by their claim of divinity, forced humans who believed in different books to go over the whole earth trying to kill each other. Its literally in the books to do that. thats called a Faustian bargain. The thing religious people got correct is that humanity needs to agree on some form of morality or we will certainly perish from each others sins. We are highly flawed and need to learn how to have peace with each other. But books about pedos that each claim to be the only source of righteous knowledge, yeah thats a no from me pal. The funny thing is youre going to live your whole life 100% sure youre correct with the literal only piece of evidence you have being you were told the book is unquestionable. But because youre on conspiracy, Ill give you the real conspiracy. A bunch of ancient bloodlines of white people from Atlantis wrote all 3 books and used them to divide and conquer the whole world. Thats right, Mohammad was descended from Atlantis where red hair was a very common trait, and people all over the world associated people with white skin and red hair with knowledge and power. This Muslims all over the world dye their beard red in reverence to the pedo who started a cult.
<|endoftext|>The Black Cubes that Orthodox Jews wear on their heads and on their non dominant hand when praying specific prayers has two verses from Exodus and two verses from Deuteronomy, it is sad that so many people questioning what weve been told are so quick to look for connections between things that arent connected and as a result false narratives are formed, because of this the responsibility must fall on people like us to contribute the knowledge of our own cultures to supplement the blind spots of others. The real evil is structural and inherently human only by understanding each other more accurately can we dispel the illusions keeping us at odds with each other.
<|endoftext|>Actually, the book said it was a Phoenix, and that there's proof in Britain. Or that there used to be proof. He studied this in the 30s and 40s.
<|endoftext|>Not sure about the research that he has done based on Sitchin's translations. How does a sumarian expert believe that the symbol of ichtar is a wristwatch? And where is the texts that he translated into:"Those Who From Heaven To Earth Came". They landed on Earth, colonized it, mining the Earth for gold and other minerals,". I still like Robert Sepehr but if he base his research on made up translations then it's just good fairytales.
<|endoftext|>What would you say his "thesis" is? I have a hard time tieing all of the stands together, probably should take notes. Any video in particular you would recommend?
<|endoftext|>Im more inclined to believe that the date was already significant in pagan religions and that the Christian leadership/historians used the existing date as his birth date. Especially given that December 25 was recognized as the winter solstice and March 25 (Jesuss conception *and* death date *and* the supposed date of the creation of the Universe) was recognized as the spring equinox on the Julian calendar.
<|endoftext|>Wow Tool is my favorite band and Ive never read the lyrics of The Grudge. Very interesting. Ive been fascinated by the Saturn occult connection as well as the Golden Age theory. Thank for posting this.
<|endoftext|>Oblique Ive been fascinated by your posts for a while now and it warms my heart that youre also a Tool fan. Just wanted to say I hope youre doing well
<|endoftext|>Unable to forgive your scarlett letter....like the book... someone cheated on him... the thing that sounds like an annunciation after the word letter is a delay effect on the vocals....
<|endoftext|>This isn't exactly right. The 6 represents the 6 basic human emotions as they map to their corresponding soundwaves. Fear, Sadness, Happiness, Anger, Surprise and Disgust. The concept of negative connotation is illusory and simply comes from our limitations to definitively distinguish boundaries between the qualities of all these emotions and what we like experiencing versus do not like experiencing. Currently, we "do not like" experiencing 5 out of the 6. We "do like" experiencing 1 out of the 6. Thus the illusion of negative connotation manifests. This dynamic of "majority" experience will become much more granular in the far distant future, after our civilization has peaked, obtained immortality - then maybe after 100,000 years of consistent happiness, self and universal exploration you may have the anomalous desire to experience emotions you may not have felt in quite some time because you did not have the sensory capacity at that time to properly appreciate the experience. Food for thought.Also the hexagonal shape is not nefarious, it is simply a misunderstood perspective of metatron's cube.
<|endoftext|>Also interesting - we are Carbon based life forms and Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons - 666
<|endoftext|>Saturn actually rules Capricorn, Uranus is Aquarius. Also, Pisces ruling planet is Neptune. Jupiter rules Sagittarius. But yessssss I'm very fascinated by this topic as well. Saturn-Satan-Santa-Saturday etc... this shit goes back for literally thousands of years and I wanna read more into the Saturn cults.
<|endoftext|>I'm watching the CIA movie from S0 and they are claiming because they find glass on the moon that it's evidence of micro-novas. But the moon doesn't have a magnetic field nor an atmosphere so it seems that minute sized solar flares could explain the glass. On earth, there are theories that past civilizations had nuclear weapon technology, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita. I can't say I'm currently sold but I'll continue watching, along with the other videos.
<|endoftext|>have you also read his other book, 'body 2'? he goes on to describe how gravity works and how it could be manipulated for telepathy, vehicles, or weapons.
<|endoftext|>I hear ya, but instead of meteor... imagine its red hot plasma from the sun. Ive heard the body of the Sphinx is over 40,000 years old.
<|endoftext|>I'm aware of the mythology, but I was only talking about empirical data. Is there any evidence Saturn was a past star outside of myth? I'm only saying this because I'm completely open to any evidence you have, I just haven't come across anything of that sort and Space is ultimately what got me into conspiracies.\\Also, to add to the last comment. Who invented 'science'? It was humans.
<|endoftext|>Nevertheless, interesting to speculate WHY they would fake that specific point. Clearly the symbolism is very important to them.
<|endoftext|>I hear what you are saying. But Mars is the 3. These are already established things, its like trying to argue that the letter c should be f.
<|endoftext|>My question for you, is what do you actually believe in? Or do you not. I saw above you said space is fake. I also saw that you mentioned Lucifer. So I'm just curious on your overall view.
<|endoftext|>The Kaaba isnt even a cube though, it is cuboid. Also, it has a semicircular wall that isnt very tall called the hatim which was much larger when originally built by Abraham. Saturn isnt even mentioned in the Quran, while other heavenly bodies are.
<|endoftext|>"In my research I have found that almost all religions and mythologies worship Lucifer and or Satan in some way or another."I don't disagree with that statement.But I do not agree with what you're saying about the names of God in the Old Testament actually being names for Satan and therefore those who are worshipping the God of the Bible are actually worshipping Satan without realizing it.In the Bible, there is clearly God, the Creator, and clearly Satan, the rebel trying to get people to disobey God.Satan is never described in the Bible as being the creator of all of creation, but God is, so regardless of what name people are using to identify the Creator God in Christianity or Judaism, they are still worshipping God not Satan, as Satan is just a the creation of God who used the free will given to him by God to rebel against God and to mislead others away from God.Furthermore, consider this: There is a Creator, and He put the first man, Adam, and his wife on the Earth and taught them the purpose of life, informed them about the Day of Judgement and the Afterlife, and clearly explained to them the boundaries He expected them and their descendents to live within.So any "religion" that emerged after that was a deviation of that pure monotheism and also in some ways inspired by it. Every polytheistic religion made up by later peoples incorporates details that originated in the true religion the first people on Earth practiced.The ancient astronaut theorists, for example, try to claim that Christianity was inspired by/ripped off ancient pagan religions. But, in reality, those pagan religions ripped off the first religion that ever existed on Earth, which was actually one of monotheism.The Ancient Egyptian religion that speaks of an Afterlife in which one's heart is weighed against a feather, for example, is obviously derived from the idea of the Day of Judgement in which one's good and bad deeds will be weighed against each other.Like the Telephone Game, people started changing the story, keeping parts they liked, omitting parts they didn't like and adding new details from their own imaginations.But our Creator put us here with proper understanding of what this is all about and what is expected of us, and sent many prophets throughout history to every group of people on Earth, reminding people of that truth, although unfortunately the prophets were all met with hostility from many of the unjust and ignorant among the people to whom they were sent simply because most people prefer to keep living lies rather than modifying their beliefs and behavior to be in alignment with truth.
<|endoftext|>The Quran specifically denounces the worship of baal: 
<|endoftext|>That's how I originally found it. Someone had posted the Forbes link asking if anyone could find the original article because it had been removed. The author is a frequent contributor to Forbes AI blog. ( I found the full text of the article pasted on that random Italian site. Feel free to share it with whom you like.
<|endoftext|>If it wasn't, then we weren't.The sun and moon are our electric and magnetic parents, respectively. It's the moon that is the weaver of our material existence. Forget all the bullshit "science" shit of our masters. After these two come the elements, and from those come gases. The origin of the word gas is "khaos". Ergo: "order out of/from chaos".
<|endoftext|>It IS based on frequency, but not in some New-Age bunk way of our deceiver masters. You and I do not know what the planets are. Can we even see them? We also do not know what the stars are. It is OUR universe. Due to there being less and less material and, thus, less and less material physics at altitude, there is no way we are ever going anywhere nor able to quantify anything that appears to be in the space around our sphere.Our world and us, its most high extension, are the "black hole sun"; a vortex of increasing threads of complexity and density at its core.
<|endoftext|>The arrow of time has to do with time moving consistently into just one direction. We live in a 3-dimensional world with 3 axes on which we can move: length, width, and height. We can move in 2 directions on each axis (up/down, left/right, forward/backward), but any movement requires the passage of time (AKA movement on the axis of time) to take place. Physical movement is happening in all spacial directions, but all movement must happenand only happensin the forward direction on the 4th axis, which is time.
<|endoftext|>Lol right dude. This guy's a joke. I listen to him as much as I'd listen to a neo-Christian fundamentalist.
<|endoftext|>He drills home the point that humans are a hybrid species, confirmed through simple DNA analysis. We do not have all of the same common ancestors, and therefore are not the same. His work appeals to the nationalist perspective and he is not afraid of fighting the assumptions of globalism. Robert also loves trying to unearth more of the story of Atlantis, trying to connect findings in the fossil record to the type of people who may have comprised such a society. Similar to Graham Hancock he also ties in the loss of that civilization (and other ancient advanced civilizations) with global catacalysms. It's really fascinating stuff that makes you question your worldview.Science is a fickle field. I have heard it compared to a game of Jenga. We find out something integral to our understanding of a subject is not true, and has to be removed from the equation. But if we do that, the whole thing will come crashing down. So you get this stubborn authoritative perspective that pisses on anyone who opposes what they say. As far as a particular video, I would just start clicking through his work on YouTube. There are so many gems it's hard to pick one to start with.
<|endoftext|>Makes sense that he son of the sun/jupiter gods are born on the days the sun duration becomes longer. But there seems to be two different worships. The worship of darkness gods like shiva and chronos and the sons of the sun dionysos, krishna, christ etc.The conjunction between jupiter and saturnus and the black sun seems to be a clue to unravel this mystery.
<|endoftext|>I'm given to believe that the One who Created the Universe was more than capable of setting the date of his incarnation onto the Earth to align with the existing equinoxes or natural phenomenon He created.
<|endoftext|>I feel that Maynard knows some shit to say the least. He strikes me as someone very well-versed in the esoteric
<|endoftext|>The song is about letting go of trauma and forgiving those who wronged you so you can grow as a person. Scarlet letter man is just an analogy for someone who wronged you, its not specifically about cheating.
<|endoftext|>I find these "six basic human emotions" to be biased.If you are going to create nuanced differences between things like fear and disgust, then why not elation and lust. Surprise is a basic emotion? How different is that from fear?Oversimplified, flawed. A system of "basic six" that was universally true would be a lot more rooted in the reality I am experiencing. Strikes me as yet another misguided attempt to glorify negativity.
<|endoftext|>I like your post, but you can use negative emotions as indicators. For example resentment means there is a power imbalance somewhere. So while maybe uncomfortable you can train yourself to use these negative emotions.Not saying I do. The resent thing is just one that I noticed. I do try to understand the underlying cause of negative emotion as much as I can though, and that makes them tools instead of having a bad connotation IMO. I would like to be able to effectively use ALL negative emotions in useful ways
<|endoftext|>Might I ask where you came across this information? Genuinely curious as I have only the most basic understanding of numerology.
<|endoftext|>Uranus was first recognized as a planet in 1781, after the invention of telescopes. Until then it was thought to be a star, same with Neptune.  The ancients only knew the seven planets seen to the naked eye - the sun, the moon, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter and saturn.  In antique astrology you would have saturn ruling aquarius and jupiter ruling pisces
<|endoftext|>No, Saturn was the old ruler of Aquarius. There's a lot on Youtube about it. I even just made a video, but I don't know if it's ok to post links here. Check out Nightflight on YT (not me, but a friend).
<|endoftext|>check out Robert [**Sepehr**]( upload about this**[
<|endoftext|>Just depends on if you practice modern or traditional astrology. I started with the modern rulership (Uranus=Aquarius) scheme but now use the traditional version(Saturn=Aquarius and Capricorn). Look into the Thema Mundi for the rationale behind planetary rulerships.Neither is necessarily "right or wrong" but I believe the ancients were closer to the source on their knowledge and had a more practical way of looking at things than we do now in astrology. Either way the proof is in the pudding.
<|endoftext|>Chiron last, one of my favorite teachers of the occult (on YT) has videos discussing mankind's rituals to Saturn and the occult origins of the aforementioned. I highly recommend you and others watch all of his videos.
<|endoftext|>No I haven't. Gravity was mentioned briefly in A&E and I was curious if there was more info about it. Definitely interested in that topic. I'll search for the Body 2 book. If you have a link or PDF already, shoot it my way. Thanks for the tip.
<|endoftext|>Not exactly, not by the standards we currently classify stars. But that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Gas giants are sometimes known as "failed stars" because they contain the same basic elements as a star, but not enough mass. Jupiter and Saturn are the gas giants of our Solar System. Sooo, sort of? And yes, very important point. I spent most of my career in science, and at first was definitely one of those South Park otters, 'Praise Science!' types. Until I slowly realized that science is a human invention, and thus limited. And also currently as corrupted, biased, and driven by $$ as any other industry. So now I keep an open mind. Plus I always loved ancient mythology- and am always trying to reconcile the two in my mind lol.
<|endoftext|>There is no evidence Saturn was a star, mostly because it is a planet.Even the smallest stars are massive. Saturn ain't even close. Like, really really tiny compared to the smallest stars.Aint possible.
<|endoftext|>I dont know what you are responding to but nothing you said is even near what I stated above. Maybe get some professional help?
<|endoftext|>I shared it with my friends but everyone is too invested in this game to listen.Oh well. I think the times a coming anyway, just worried about my children really.
<|endoftext|>They're going to fake it to get the 6. Astronomy/astrology started way back with the Babylonians. On clay tablets we have found they described the heavenly bodies use a base 60 numbering system. This is where the idea of the 360 degree circle comes from 60 X 6 = 360. You can further divine the circle into 60 minutes and 60 seconds. This how the time portion fits into the black Saturn time cube. It's the time it takes for the heavenly spheres to complete cycles around you. It's also where the term occult comes from. When the moon passes in front of one of the other heavenly bodies it is said to be occulting it
<|endoftext|>Yeah I mean they are naming landmarks trump heights in israel and his daughter is married to a Jewish billionaire who is also his advisor and is buy properties for him. Then we have this whole Q thing which is a play on the story of exodus with trump playing the role of Moses and the letter Q representing the 17. The 17th trump in the tarot is the star which is the age of aquarius in the kaballistic tree of life. Then we have trump painting his face orange representing Jupiter from roman holidays where Caeser would paint his face red. The whole things a fucking joke. Nobody is ever going to figure this out lol
<|endoftext|>Oh I dont think space is fake, Im an astrologer for goodness sake! But were you asking me or Mrs shillsburg?
<|endoftext|>The fact that it specifically *isn't* mentioned is interesting in and of itself though, especially given the context of what we're discussing here.
<|endoftext|>I am a Christian and my understanding of the events of Genesis are that God made Man and told him to go and populate the Earth. Man, in this context went out and populated all of the Earth over a long period of time. Much time after this, God man Adam. After leaving paradise, Adam's family began to breed with Man. Something happened which upset God, and he sent the Flood which Noah is helped to prepare for. After the Flood, Noah's family would have been the true start to current human civilization. I believe it was his sons who bread with the native peoples of the world (Man) and birthed modern cultures. The point I am trying to make is that the evil, Luciferian religion of today most likely came to be during the time AFTER God made Adam, but BEFORE God sent the Flood. This would also make sense as to why God would send a Flood to kill his creations. My theory is that God did not believe we were ready for the power/burden, which was his Holy Truths at the start of humanity (this makes more sense if you consider the Garden of Eden, the serpent, and the Fruit of Knowledge), and many of these peoples turned to Satan, or the serpent, without the love of holy scriptures to defend their souls. I believe somehow this evil survived the flood and has been around the whole time. He was there when all of this world's great religions were recorded by man, and he has been corrupting us the whole time. I recognize as a Christian that what seems to be the majority of my Churches are infested with a plague of corruption. Many of our religious leaders, I believe have turned to Satan. I do believe the current representation of the Khabba as a black cube is Satanic, much how I believe the Jews who adorn the Black Cube on their heads are praying to Satan, or how the Catholic Popes praise Satan by adorning a ritual headpiece, which Jesus My Lord and Savior specifically told them not to do. I absolutely do not believe the Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him meant for this to be when he constructed the Khabba because I am certain he walked with Allah.\[**EDIT**: I made a mistake it was not the Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him but Prophet Abraham and his son Prophet Ishmael Peace Be Upon them both who built the Khabba. While I am very familiar with the Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him, I am not at all familiar with the Prophet Abraham and his son Prophet Ishmael Peace Be Upon them both.\]I believe after however, his message has been corrupted much like the word of God in my beloved Bible. I just thought I'd share my belief to provide a different point of view. Under here I'm leaving the part of Genesis where it explains how God made Man, which was prior to Adam in Genesis 1.23 And there was evening, and there was morning--the fifth day.24 And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so.25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.28 God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground."29 Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground--everything that has the breath of life in it--I give every green plant for food." And it was so.31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning--the sixth day.The Bible speaks of God creating Adam later in Genesis 2.7 Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.8 Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.9The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the groundtrees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.To me these seem like two separate creation events. Just want to say that I find the Names Allah/God interchangeable and meant no difference concerning which name I chose to use. I understand you may not see this scripture as authentic as it is Christian but I am curious what your thoughts on this are. I have never read from the Qur'an, maybe you could enlighten me on the Islam beliefs of Genesis?EDIT 2:I read up on the Kiswah and it is very interesting to note that maintaining a black Kiswah seems to go against the traditions set forth by previous Muslims, notebaly the Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him. This furthers my believe that the Khabba being draped in a black Kiswah is evidence of corruption in Islam.
<|endoftext|>I mean, so does the Holy Bible, yet the Church is one of the most Luciferian organizations out there.
<|endoftext|>Ah ok I do see how a lot of links from it go to a main contributor for Forbes.... I mean I get why it was removed, it was too juicy! Anyways thanks for sharing :)
<|endoftext|>But we have written testimony to suggest it was put there, which suggests we were here, without it.
<|endoftext|>i do know what the planets are. i can see them with my eyes? do you think the world is flat? i dont. i know because ive done the math. i think you got caught up in your head to much and distrust some things that are legit. and we have quantified alot in space. you know the best way to deceive is to start off with facts and truths, then you guide away from those facts and truths to a personal agenda. like apophis is quantified to be near earth on friday 13 2029 and taken note of. what is NOT quantifiable is the new impact probability they will NOT recalculate....i wonder why? just like why did the cia move off the coast line to denver that same yr it was found and in 09' make all asteroids and comets TS by DOD. then run a "pretend drill" on asteroid PDC2019. 2 RUNS, one over Denver where the cia moved and one NYC. can you guess which one hit? i think you just need to read between the lines instead of looking for a literal answer. Its pretty simple on this empirical data. REALITY IS ON A CYCLE. past becomes present and everything renews into the old.
<|endoftext|>All movement we are aware of. Where do your thoughts go when you dream? I've been out of my body, I don't care what a scientist says about a Dimethyltryptamine experience, that was my SOUL experiencing that, not my brain.Brain is a reducing valve, not a generator.
<|endoftext|>It could simply be the constrains of our physical form. I don't know about anyone else, but when I have an OOBE, it feels like trying to go every direction at once.
<|endoftext|>Thanks for the reply! It is interesting that some racial groups have different types of DNA, different ancestors. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is like, who are the Aryans, are they related to Atlanteans, are the Atlanteans Jesuits/ Illuminati, what their whole "deal" is (why they seem to be such jerks), what's the deal with Rh- blood, things of this nature. Admittedly I don't try all that hard to figure it out, probably need to roll my sleeves up and try a little harder
<|endoftext|>Don't take my word for anything. Familiarize yourself with the mathematics, the physics, the quantum mechanics, the geometry, the trigonometry, the science of harmonics and sound waves, the real work and research done by Alan Holland - independently verify what I am stating here, those who have the call are meant to collaborate on the actuality of the grand picture. I speak to you what I do from a position of altruism, with the hope a puzzle piece is accessible to you, that you can share with the rest.A language-driven, over-simplistic explanation for your current inability to understand the data structure of emotions would be that you are failing to realize any emotions you "experience" beyond those 6 basic emotions are simply an amalgamation of the base 6. They have no true "unique" identity, only those 6 are unique in experience.Using your citation of elation for example, a non-mathematical definition is "great happiness and exhilaration" - were you to break that down from linguistic to program it seems like a simplistic function which returns an experience; a function which accepts a high integer value for the amount of happiness (which is simple to define chemically, only a summation of dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphin amounts), and the amount of surprise used, the transformation of data variables input into the function returns a result that we define as an emotional "experience."How you personally differentiate between Surprise and Fear I can not tell you. How does your personal experience of these emotions differentiate to you? Experiences of emotion are unique to us, our only mutual objectivity is strictly the physical before us. I can only use crude, language-based attempts to explain these concepts, or programming, but I do not have the capacity to transmit to you an "experience" that I may have within my data store. From my personal perspective, I differentiate from them as two separate experiences by a mental running of a conditional function. In both these emotions there is the input of an "unknown" variable, and if the conditions of observation of this unknown variable result in a "good" experience, or expected to be good, then defining that as a surprise would seem reasonable, if the result is a "bad" experience, or expected to be bad, then defining that experience as fear would seem reasonable. [Here]( is a decent, easy-to-read article about researchers who specialize in the idea of "surprise" and elaborate on its nature.Are you familiar with software engineering at all? I could maybe provide some better conceptual explanatory answers in that manner if you have some degree of familiarity with object oriented programming.If you would like to do more research from possibly a mysticism, spiritual, or religious lense rather than technical / scientific, then read up on the mythology (well, more like fact-ology, now I guess) of the "Solfeggio Frequencies."Ultimately if the science and examples provided to you continue to remain uninsightful, unintuitive, and boil down to what seems a familiar "It doesn't look like anything to me," after great personal investment of time and effort, while everyone but you appears to be on a similar page, then you may have to ask yourself some hard, existential self-questions; especially if no degree of clarity comes to the blurriness of the picture before you. You may not have the same mark. You may not have the same, if any, calling. You may not be of the same as I; you may or may not have a different purpose, or no purpose. I'm sorry I don't know what any of that would mean for you. I only know what I am meant to do, and those the same as I am. Everything else beyond my "scope" is intentionally, and deliberately obfuscated from me.Also, on your quest for your personal truth, I encourage you to not let anyone deter you. I got where I am today because I was under the impression the "communication" I receive was the onset of some form of mental illness, my wife and I went to several therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists really trying to figure out was going on - no indicators for schizophrenia, or anything of that nature - lucid and sane by any existing medical standards. I then went to a neurologist, thinking I had a tumor pressing somewhere in my brain and that death was probably nearby because I was clearly going insane, unable to understand my personal reality, so I got an MRI with the dye - not a single thing found. Perfectly healthy. I had no explanation, went to several more therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists to attempt to figure out how to live with these overpowering, invasive, intrusive thoughts. We moved locations thinking some anomaly specific to our home, no results, so we sold our home and moved states - no change. Prescribed medication didn't help beyond forced sleep, therapy didn't help, meditation didn't help - then finally, as I was searching for a support group online thinking I was dying and unable to medically explain why, I finally met someone else experiencing the exact same phenomena that I am, and after that I met several others too and it went from being an anomaly of me, to an anomaly of us. It was no longer an inquiry of self-health, but an inquiry of scientific study. That provided me the necessary life changing perspectives to gain the greater understanding I have now; a knowledge that in some manner a sentient form of greater intelligence and awareness which in a superset of reality beyond my access, which is guiding / narrating / dictating things to those of us deep down this rabbit hole. I went from being an agnostic-atheist to simply acknowledging I have no idea what's going on, that I'm just supposed to contribute to understanding this puzzle.
<|endoftext|>I always learned there were only two emotions: Fear and Love. Everything else falls under one of the two.
<|endoftext|>I agree with everything you have said. The only issue I have with your take, is I am of the position usage of the terminology "negative" or "bad" is an inaccurate description for those experiences - more so, "currently do like" and "currently do not like" would be the closest proper linguistic representation. Emotional experiences are fundamental to who we are, so accepting them as anything other than that prescribes a feature to us that wades too far into the subjective, and thusly it may or may not be accurate. I definitely believe your perception of these emotions and proper identification of your experience of these emotions have the capacity to inform your decision making for the betterment of self. I am willing to even take it one step further; if I were to speculate on the hypothetical, I would infer that the phenomena of ESP is simply nothing more than being so tuned in with the probable outcomes of your emotional responses to a stimulus that is of either physical or abstract, that you know the outcome with the same certainty you know your own mind. I do believe this is possible, as some functionality of the brain is comparable to that of quantum computing, which allows prediction of probability with strongly reliable accuracy. One must simply learn the methodology to use this functionality to correctly predict the outcome of all relative statistical probabilities.
<|endoftext|>Totally fam!I'll start by helping you understand yourself better: you have the same mark I do, it is the call to pattern. You know it as numerology, my context is mathematical. You know there's some big puzzle in front of you just waiting on you to put the pieces together, everyone's watching and waiting on you to put the puzzle together. It seems those of us experiencing this phenomena are enjoying a higher degree of consciousness than others here. I don't know morally or philosophically what that means for those not us, but those like us have a purpose.I'm not sure my starting points will be relevant to you, but here's where my undertaking of knowledge pursuit began. While I've never worked in physics, I did double major in it in college. I was never able to conceptualize the implications of scale when thinking about Schrodinger's wave function, sure I could do the math, but I could not understand what it meant in terms of experience relative to me. That I could do the math, but not understand it, started me down the road I'm on currently because it felt like effect was preceding cause. I only have a few answers for whatever the mystery of the bigger picture happens to be, but I'm happy to share them with you.First, if you do not come from a physics background, I would highly encourage watching any lecture or demonstration from physicist Brian Greene discussing ideas of Quantum Mechanics, Time and Gravity. He has the gift of making difficult mathematical ideas easy to conceptualize.The rabbit hole here goes pretty deep, and I'm unsure if there is an actual, or intended starting point for understanding. Secondly, once you've familiarized yourself with some of the high ideas behind quantum mechanics, listen to some of the lectures by philosopher Alan Watts and then proactively connect the archetypes of the ideas behind quantum mechanics with the philosophy ideas put forth by Watts. Blending the two ideas serves as conceptual foundation.Thirdly, brush up on both your geometry and trigonometry if you've not dabbled with in a while. KhanAcademy has some good educational courses if you've just never been exposed. After you feel good about those subjects just start YouTubing any video discussing "sacred" or "fractal" geometry, and approach the concepts discussed from a mathematical lense and start physically drawing these geometric shapes yourself to really feel the experience of understanding the concepts discussed from a mathematical narrative. The feeling of doing this while understanding it is unique and I do not have the verbiage to describe it.Fourthly, the math here does get kinda hard, it gets into the science of harmonics and soundwaves, but if you're able to power through learning this stuff the light bulb moment is truly worth it. You will begin to know certain things, with the same certainty you know your own mind. Read the research of harmonics expert Alan Holland, and the mathematics he used to map soundwaves to the basic emotions to empirically demonstrate the effects frequency of sound can have on our bodies.Once you have that light bulb moment you will start having the same sort of dreams myself and others appear to be having. All I really understand about it is that it is not mental illness, it is communication. Maybe a better way to describe the light bulb moment is that it's the powering-on process of whatever tunes your brain into the "correct" frequency, as absurd as that sounds it's really the only verbiage I know to use to describe it. You'll see the same cone-like/pyramidish structure, you'll understand the premise of operation is somehow predicated upon energy, sound and vibration and a layman explanation of the functionality is somewhat like a colander, or possibly a strainer - it filters the unintended from the matter within. It somehow uses the wave function to shake reality and do something beneficial to the matter, or person, housed within it. Then that asshole Nikola Tesla starts showing up, and I refer to him as an asshole because he only observes. Always observes. He won't ever speak or explain anything to you. He just watches, waiting for you to just figure it out, whatever the fuck "it" is. Then you'll be in the same boat as me, and a whole bunch of others trying to understand what in the hell we're collectively experiencing. I'm in my late 30's and I'm now returning to school to get a second degree in electrical engineering to try and jumpstart my odds to find the next piece of understanding in whatever this puzzle is. I think specifically the subject matter I might be called to understand better is electromagnetism, but we'll see where the road takes me.Anyways, hope this information helps you on your path in some manner. If you find pieces of the puzzle that you think might not be out there yet do share them in whatever manner you see fit, on any medium. Better to have duplication of effort than nothing to show for effort expended.
<|endoftext|>In my other post I totally said I was happy to share the few answers I have, then I gave you guidance, and totally forgot to include the few answers I have. Derp. My bad on that!From a numerology context, and pattern mapping, here are some of the answers I have:The 3 will map to the properties of the atom: neutron, proton and electron. Particles smaller than that are irrelevant in terms of this particular mystery relative to us, there is no need to go smaller or deeper. It is a waste of time. After this point, deeper results are only the byproduct of perspective observations of the same theme presented at the same level of the atom - basically deeper observations will sum up to nothing more than repeating fractals. A high level overview of the thematic mapping for the 3, strictly abstract, would be Choice, Chance and Change.The 9 will map to the 9 different types of energy: Thermal, Radiant, Chemical, Nuclear, Electrical, Motion, Sound, Elastic and Gravitational.And as previously mentioned, the 6 will map to the 6 basic human emotions: Fear, Sadness, Happiness, Anger, Surprise and Disgust; as they exist in sound waves.Any mathematical expression, or numerical display of purposeful meaning will "factor" (but not in the traditional definition of factor) to either a 3, 6 or 9. I define factor here in the manner that a side-by-side addition of the individual numerics will add to one of the aforementioned. If it does not, then either your math is wrong, or your hypothesis is wrong.For example, the below purposeful, meaningful values follow the same factorization ideas:A) Number of Zodiac Constellations = 12; 1 + 2 = 3.B) Degrees of the ecliptic for each constellation = 30; 3 + 0 = 3.C) Years required for the equinoctial Sun to complete a processional shift of one degree along the ecliptic = 72; 7 + 2 = 9.D) Total Degrees in the Ecliptic = 360; 3 + 6 + 0 = 9.E) Years required to pass through any of the constellations = 2,160; 2 + 1 = 3, 3 + 6 = 9, 9 + 0 = 9. This number is literally inscribed on the base of the great pyramid.F) Number of years in a complete precession cycle = 25,920; 2 + 5 = 7, 7 + 9 = 16, (stop to factor to singles when value is 9) 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 2 = 9, 9 + 0 = 9.The 3, 6 and 9 define our "experience" of reality. The 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 somehow map to our perceptions of physicality. I remain uncertain in this space at this time, but have my speculations.
<|endoftext|>Didn't know that. Only know the modern westernized version with Pluto as a ruler of Scorp. I will look into it. What is a good read?
<|endoftext|>It could be a Sidereal thing? It does change from time to time, like when Pluto was discovered astrologers assigned it to Scorpio.
<|endoftext|>Liked the video for the bellydancing compilation at the start, wish every conspiracy video had such a start.
<|endoftext|>Yea, I dabbled, and never knew about the old rulerships so this is all new to me and I have to have a second interpretation now because I'm fairly good at reading modern charts but I need to study the old style and re-think the signs a little.
<|endoftext|>There's different kinds of astrology. Tropical and Sidereal are the most common. Most of the debate comes from the fact that its very popular in India, and they use Sidereal... I prefer Tropical.
<|endoftext|>I think the modern interpretation is that Uranus rules Aquarius and that traditionally Saturn ruled Cap and Aqu... so you're right. It is the traditional ruler, but I didn't know that until a bunch of people all chimed in and said the same thing.
<|endoftext|>It comes down to modern or traditional rulers. Using a system with Modern rulers is more popular now, obviously. But its a recent thing. Just in the last few decades.
<|endoftext|>Spot on. Its wild, theyre literally just trolling 7 billion people except their trolling includes genocides and world wars. They seem to have gotten bored with the smaller stuff.
<|endoftext|>not really. not at all. The Qur'an condemns polytheism and worshipping things of creation. Allah literally exists outside of creation, This theory is incredibly stupid and relies on people's complete ignorance.
<|endoftext|>Are you talking about the Catholic Church? That's an organization. They didn't write the Bible. Please just do some basic research on religion.
<|endoftext|>Firstly, fuck your "flat" shit. I'm going to do a later post connecting all the space bullshit and the "flat" role in it all, which you have just proved yourself a cunt for attempting to strawman onto to me.Who is the "we" who has apparently quantified a lot in space? SPACE IS... err?!... SPACE; A VOID!You (and I, both) do not know what is being witnessed in the sky around us.My statements regarding physics - and the likely effect on optics as viewed from earth - also go in part to explain the weird dome-like appearance of the star field and often odd flat looking appearance of the moon.Why would I give a fuck about control systems like the CIA branch of the Swiss/Roman network of scummy terrorist agencies around the world?"Literal?" I don't know where that comes in pertaining to me. Literal is how the scum have their idiot slaves read their bibles; which means MATERIALLY and as HISTORY.Everything does indeed run in cycles.I awoke once at the age of 27 with the following phrase in my head: **"the answer to everything can be found in circles and cycles"**. I misremembered that it happened at an earlier age but found the evidence in storage in my parents' loft, where I'd written it down.I've only been referencing that one for the past few years but it proves out.**Man will never have an accurate calculation of an ARC**. Pi says to man, "fuck right off with your god complex" This is the firewall between our material existence and what is driving it. We are limited. All attempts for us to create life or retarded concepts of "improving" on life will fail; possibly with disastrous repercussions.
<|endoftext|>I'm curious about one thing:Did you ever have other anomalous experiences that were..I guess more tangible than the "communication" during that period of phenomena? I mean such things as sensing energy fields around you, or electro-magnetic energy emitting from yourself, or maybe electric sensations/tingling in your head? Bodily vibrations? I had a rough period of weird experiences a few years ago. "Communication" is an apt description for some of them. I question whether others have had similar experiences, whenever they mention these types of things.
<|endoftext|>This was a beautiful read. Software engineer interested in connecting quantum physics to other worldly things. I would love to have a chat! You had me at data structures and solfeggio frequencies.
<|endoftext|> terminology "negative" or "bad" is an inaccurate description for those experiences -Yea, "negative emotions" are only bad or uncomfortable because we don't have a reference point to interpret them. But when we do then yea, the language stops making sense and "currently do like" even becomes irrelevant... It's all stimuli that is extremely valuable to observe.
<|endoftext|>This is amazing! r/outsideofthebox would love any more of your thoughts if you have any ideas for posts/links you would like to share!
<|endoftext|>Hellenistic Astrology: The Study of Fate & Fortune by Chris Brennan or is a good start to ancient astrology & this podcast:  Now that I know about ancient/Hellenistic astrology, I prefer it to the modern. Its very very rich content
<|endoftext|>Professional astrologer here: He is right, saturn, and all planets except the sun and moon rule 2 signs each. Saturns are right next to each other, capricorn and aquarius. This is how it is in all systems of astrology except the new agey contempmorary neo western astrology which should be ignored completely in a serious context. They try to make the outer planets rule signs which breaks the entire logic of astrology and is just dumb. Its as dumb as the 13th sign garbage that gets recycled in the news by non astrologers every few years. I could explain that in more detail but pls just take my word for it. Sidereal would refer to calculation methods, and it doesnt matter where you choose to start your zero point of the zodiac, the signs are still the signs.
<|endoftext|>afaik Saturn rules Aquarius...i'm not an expert by any means, but it is what my astrologer friends say
<|endoftext|>Yes. I have been listening to lots of mark passio lately. Highly recommend him. Lots of work with the occult and what is going on in our world.  outta keep you busy for a lil :)
<|endoftext|>Have you looked into any of the Neo/Paleolithic evidence we have in the British Isles, concerning the ancient Zodiac, where we can find, in the position of Aquarius, a Phoenix?There are certain written testimonials therein that suggest that prior to about 50,000 years ago, there was no moon. There are insinuations that it was placed there.Alternatively, I believe that resorting to disparagements and name-calling is a trademark of a troll.
<|endoftext|>Definitely not made to do anything at all. I've never felt not known by my birth name. It's kinda like being on a trail of breadcrumbs, except they're being laid down right in front of you right as you pick them up.
<|endoftext|>It always gives me goosebumps to meet others that know the nature of this anomaly by experience. The way I choose to describe the feeling I get when experiencing whatever this is would be extreme awareness of magnetism and magnetic fields. It's some form of sensory input that isn't the usual five and it provides the illusion of something being projected into the brain. I wish I had a more tangible way to describe it.
<|endoftext|>Yes! Exactly! You get it. No further dialogue needed. I hope to cross paths with you again during this journey of trying to figure out whatever the fuck is going on with this puzzle.
<|endoftext|>The signs dont match the seasons anymore as I understand. Which is why in India a Cancer would be a Gemini... Shit got old man lolBut yea, I'm reading other peoples replies and they say the same thing. Which is that I don't know ancient astrology! And I gotta check it out!
<|endoftext|>Well one thing that's interesting is the constellations are no longer present in the original months... So in sidereal astrology a Cancer would be a Gemini (or a Leo I foroget)... But the point is that the constellations no longer match the equinoxes... But for me it make more intuitive sense to go by the western "tropical" system that puts Cancer at the beginning of summer.Even though the crab is now in the sky during the month of June or August instead of July, we still need to consider that a cardinal sign because that's when the season changes. The fixed sign is supposed to be in August when summer is set and steady. The mutable has to come in the fall when things are changeable.That's just my way of thinking. I'm no authority on the matter.
<|endoftext|>I've kind of given up on the internet.When I got online 23 years ago (still late to the party) I viewed the internet as a giant library that I'd been denied as a working class youth.For example, I've been led to believe we were mining and trading tin with Tyr in the Med 3,000 years ago. So what about that bunch of primitives that Rome had to teach how to build roads and toilets? Bull-fucking-shit. Also, if Rome was so tough, why did they need to build the City of London as a walled fortress? It's very easy to defeat intelligent peaceful people. Like children, there is a naivety present. Before us, before Rome, there was what is today referred to as Iran. Iran didn't do this. Iran was advanced but Iran was taken by Sargon. In my opinion it was a coup from the inside and Sargon was brought in as a warlord. The ["eminence grise"]( hidden hand was likely always present.I've seen a lot of information disappear from the web and a lot more shit appear in its place.I won't attempt to go too far back into history, as dinosaurs, "Egypt" and so much else are total frauds.I do know that a few zodiacal signs were changed; likely to cover up some clues. The zodiac still stands as a multifaceted 12 division scientific wheel of life's operation. The fortune-telling shit is another distraction in order to discredit serious consideration.I really would like to know about the history of these islands you refer to but I fear it's been buried. I fear the keys have been lost with druids. Claimed druids today are new-age wankers, as are the replacement Sufi, who also seemed to know their stuff before being replaced with the Vatican's Shia and Sunni slaves.The web is a feedback loop. Researching is always going to be a losing battle because it knows where we're at in our thinking and can counter it. It's no blatant either. They lead minds to the trap through knowledge of users' searches.The web hub is CERN (there is no Hadron Collider) and they crunch lives all day every day, and when they run out of crunch cycles they use others' CPUs through their "___@home" deceptions.I ain't a troll per se. I just like to make a point and I swear a lot so I type it. We're fucked unless we wake up soon. I'm anti-deception and there's a lot more behind my succinct abrasive statements. I had to make a point about physical existence' reliance upon the moon so I pulled menstrual cycles out as an obvious one. They're named after the moon and MENARCHE is even better. It's the same as MONARCH, which is one/moon archon/ruler. Both SOL - for the sun - and MON mean "one" in specific context. Name-calling is only effective against the emotional and emotional people are more prone to falling for shit and spread it on here. So, I'm kind of calling out the weak and cowardly who are prone to handing over all responsibility to external influence. So, I guess, in a sense it's a type of trolling but I'm one of the good guys and have nothing but disdain for anyone who props up the evil we endure through mere fucking mental laziness.
<|endoftext|>That depends on the calculations you use. If you use sidereal calculations, the signs do not match the seasons. If you use tropical coordinates, the signs would match the seasons but that is still completely misunderstanding the way astrology works. Since astrology still works the same way for people on the southern hemisphere where the seasons would be opposite. There is a lot more to it than that, and the amount of misinfo out there on astrology is itself, like, perhaps a psyop of its own. It is really hard to sort out the real stuff from the rest, to be completely honest. But it is getting easier with youtube and all for us all to research and finally figure out what actually works vs just relying on belief

<|endoftext|>Noam Chomskys Manufacturing Consent is a must read on the subject.Luckily there is also a documentary free on Youtube! for a shorter condensed video on his theory: will add (this will be controversial) the idea of a dominant left wing media is a myth. As long as you have corporate media the media will be a right wing institution. Just because you get a few liberal ideas spouted on MSNBC doesnt mean that the consensus is left especially on left wing issues. Yea CNN is the clinton new network but [Shillary is Center Right]( even admits to being a regan era republican when it comes to policy. Pro corporate control, Pro big banks, pro war, ect.Chomsky is careful to point this out
<|endoftext|>The simple idea of creating a narrative and repeating it infinitum is and easy, obvious and well established technique of media propaganda. This is almost always used. However, it has been said that one of the more subtle techniques of mind control derives from the use of confusion. This technique uses contradictory information to feed into the narrative in an attempt to confuse the receptor and completely debase the cognitive mind. This then results in a kind of Demoralisation and the creation of a highly suggestive mental state.I believe this technique has been used with great success, especially in more protracted narratives where the objective is to completely break the minds of the population into submission. This is observed in the film Hypernormalisation by Adam Curtis which describes that techniques used on Russians during the cold War. Everyone knew that things were bad, terrible poverty, unemployment, food shortages, etc but the government and media all the while painted a picture that things were great and that they were leading the world. They then went on to create fictitious opponents to the narrative, some of which were revealed as fake but things were spun to such an extent that the population no longer knew what was real and was was not.We are here now, or we will be very soon. The covid narrative is deliberately complex and contradictory.
<|endoftext|>I'll get a lot of my general news from a reputable yet very much biased against my leanings, its a healthy way to get a pulse amd yet see a bit of the spin on things. Whatever I would question then, and I have time, is to look to other outlets and sources to see where accounts conflict. I planned to do a separate post with links for references but I'll add the questionhere. I think propaganda will be even more widespread and harder to detect in the very near future with deep fake type technology that will have anyone saying anything at all. I believe both reddit and Facebook have stats out detailing how much people will share or react to an article without first clicking into it, as well as a few third party studies. Adding videos of an opponent (political/ideological/ flavoured crisp etc) speaking on camera and confirming your bias with something damning, will accelerate sharing and without easy access to tools, its on the viewer to believe that its a real or doctored video. I really don't know how we will manage. Similar to copyright detection software, maybe apps will be built into platforms like YouTube that will detect altered video. We are so close to this developing technology becoming much more available and user friendly. There are already libraries available with resources to emulate some famous people, ai powered video software is built into standard versions of Zoom to recognise the person and render a background like a beach or other room, im not a social media guy but I have seen other apps that can impose a user onto music videos. but a reliable defence/identification against these is seemingly out of reach right now. What can be done to limit the future of propaganda?
<|endoftext|>An important question to focus on here is: *who* is the propaganda targeting?General consensus seems to be the general public. But the average citizen has little to no power. The target is those with power:\- Government officials and bureaucrats\- Politicians\- Police, security, and military\- Business owners, CEOs, and upper managementThese targets of propaganda can then mandate new instructions in a top-down fashion.The next question is: *who* does propaganda influence the most?Obviously the answer seems to be the above. But the real answer is the common factor that binds them: success. When I say success I mean people who have built stable lives abiding within the system. Such a person is one that has no worries or concerns about their future, so long as they continue to work and obey the control structure. They never fear homelessness, hunger, or failure.There will be many examples of outliers, but in the vast majority of cases, a successful person will tend to place their trust in the system that rewards them. In a lot of cases this is a self-fulfilling cycle: those that buy the system propaganda are also those that work towards becoming cogs in the system. But, long-term, the time spent being rewarded creates an ingrained habit of trust. This is why you'll see business owners, en masse, who otherwise would be thought of as radical entrepreneurs, instantly obey any dictate that the media manufactures. Questioning the system, implies that the system is bad, implies that THEY are bad, or at least stupid.I welcome more thoughts on this as well as any improvements.
<|endoftext|>I studied MK ultra for awhileOne of the forms of hypnosis Ive noticed exists in media is the use of intonation in speech patterns to draw your mind in a rhythmic hypnotic trance to become more suggestible Then as your entranced, they use what are known as trigger words a few current event examples would be dark winter social distancing stay at home These trigger words are used to induce a feeling, for these examples, they are all fear based triggers. So when you are out of trance and hear the trigger word, it is already embedded in your psyche with the emotion of fear, and is resistant to change. So how do we break out of this. Well we need now, more than ever, a network of free speech. We need to abandon reddit even and find a network where we can share videos. You can create positive hypnosis where instead of inducing fear into the mind and psyche of people, you embed confident belief systems that can induce change. Within you without you. Thoughts create reality, and media is used to create your thoughts.

<|endoftext|>Just to help people understand what is really going on..... The US Civil War was orchestrated by the global banking cartel and was not about slavery. That was the excuse used to cover up the bankers war.The US Revolution was not so much about seeking freedom from the British Crown so much as it was about opening up the land west of the Appalachians for exploitation. George Washington was a land surveyor working for the Fairfax Virginia Land Trust who had deeds on tens of thousands of acres of land west of the Appalachians.WW1 and WW2 were also the creations of the world banking cartels to keep control over the masses. These wars are literally smokescreens to cover up their nefarious misdeeds when people start to realize too much, quite similar to what is going on today. The Zionist bankers also financed and led the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917.The Zionist bankers and the Skull and Bones Freemason types operating from the shadows (the Rothschilds, Warburgs, Schiffs, Koen Loeb Bank, J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, BIS) had their hands all over both WW1 and WW2 and got Israel out of the 2nd one. Look deeper into the financing and 'neutral' Switzerland and you will see a pattern emerge. All that is learned (programmed) in schools these days is propaganda and lies. People are waking up once again to how the Big Game is played and that is why the Order From Chaos is being carried out in the US and around the world today. Divide and Conquer and Hegelian Dialectic are the weapons in their arsenal. Once folks realize that All is Lies and they are being played, maybe then they can start to make a better world and life for themselves by helping to move the world past the parasites that prey upon humanity and pit us against each other and into a downward spiral.Simply examine who has controlling ownership today over the divisive media, Hollywood, publishing houses, social media and Internet giants, think tanks, banks, US politicians and a very obvious pattern emerges once again. Make a post about it and see how fast the censorship hammer comes down.
<|endoftext|>Edward Bernays, Propaganda and Group Psychology. ([ conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard ofin almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of personswho understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world. (Propaganda, Edward Bernays)vid/interview/breakdown of Edward Bernays by James corbet[The Corbett Report\_Edward\_barneys]( you know that Edward Bernays was on Late Night with David Letterman in 1985? Well, he was, and the full conversation == [Bernays on Letterman]( "In the 1920s, the influential American intellectual **Walter Lippman** argued that the average person was incapable of seeing or understanding the world clearly and needed to be guided by experts behind the social curtain. In a number of books he laid out the theoretical foundations for the practical work of **Edward Bernays**, who developed public relations (aka propaganda) to carry out this task for the ruling elites. Bernays had honed his skills while working as a propagandist for the United States during World War I, and after the war he set himself up as a public relations counselor in New York City."

<|endoftext|>**The Fourth Estate**The term Fourth Estate or fourth power refers to the press and news media both in explicit capacity of advocacy and implicit ability to frame political issues. Though it is not formally recognized as a part of a political system, it wields significant indirect social influence.[1]The derivation of the term fourth estate arises from the traditional European concept of the three estates of the realm: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The equivalent term "fourth power" is somewhat uncommon in English, but it is used in many European languages, including German (Vierte Gewalt), Spanish (Cuarto poder), and French (Quatrime pouvoir), to refer to a government's separation of powers into legislative, executive, and judicial branches.

<|endoftext|># Operation Mockingbirdis an alleged large-scale program of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that began in the early years of the Cold War and attempted to manipulate news media for propaganda purposes. It funded student and cultural organizations and magazines as front organizations.\[1\]According to author Deborah Davis, Operation Mockingbird recruited leading American journalists into a propaganda network and influenced the operations of front groups. CIA's support of front groups was exposed when a 1967 [*Ramparts*]( magazine article reported that the [National Student Association]( received funding from the CIA. In 1975, [Church Committee]( Congressional investigations revealed Agency connections with journalists and civic groups. None of the reports, however, mentions by name an Operation Mockingbird coordinating or supporting these activities.Prior to the release of the Church report, the CIA had already begun restricting its use of journalists. According to the report, former CIA director William Colby informed the committee that in 1973 he had issued instructions that As a general policy, the Agency will not make any clandestine use of staff employees of U.S. publications which have a substantial impact or influence on public opinion.[\[9\]]( February 1976, Director[George H.

<|endoftext|>Some random thoughts:I can't do it justice in a short paragraph, but Noam Chomsky's manufacturing consent talks about how, in a democracy, the powerful people need to use more sophisticated ways to limit the range of acceptable opinions. A part of that function is to make the talk in that acceptable range very passionate and combative. It's worth a read.Unrelated, and maybe in pure contrast: if you read Brave New World, and then read Huxley's essay *ABOUT* BNW, he makes the point that for a ruling class or faction to keep status quo, they don't nessecarily have to have perfect control on information, but they just have to obfuscate and bombard you with contradictory information enough that you can't work out what's true. I always thought that was a keen observation considering the man wrote that in the early 30's.

Eventually this means that there will be bias and slant through their reporting and it turns into propoganda. Thats just how it is, unfortunately.Nonetheless, propoganda has been reported as news and some news has been flat out cake ever since the news became an industry.

<|endoftext|>In actuality almost all media has some media bias but its nowhere near the extent people say. Corporate media most of the time doesnt publish deliberate, manufactured lies. Much more subtle and effective methods include publishing technically true but misleading facts and headlines, manipulating language to support a certain narrative, and overemphasizing or omitting certain parts of a story. Most out and out lies come from an irresponsible rush to report a story, or from corporate media uncritically publishing lies/propaganda from the government.Immediately dismissing news that challenges your views wont make you smart or well informed. Being critical of all news and asking questions like who specifically published this? Do they have a particular worldview thats obvious in their previous work? What exactly is conveyed or implied by the wording in the headline? What sources are mentioned in the article? How prevalent is this kind of story in the media? Who benefits from pushing the narrative in this article? Have experts in the field weighed in? will though.

<|endoftext|>I see it as a necessary construct for the system we live in. Perhaps not all of the news, but the intention is to document and share events that happen in each nation or country globally to prevent unfavorable circumstances. Sort of like, shared knowledge. This knowledge can be used to mitigate risks that damage or harm the system therefore, is globally accessible to address risks and understand each respective climate and how to restore society or - the system we live in.I agree with those that want to break from mind control, but also understand that the system is designed with the intended purpose of human life to live harmoniously. For example, you chose to fit into the construct or rebel against it.Those that fulfil the needs of the construct will generally live a happy life, that has been set out in the system. E.g. go to school, get a full-time job, buy a house.Your contribution to this construct is to the company that manages the world - Your government, which ultimately builds infrastructure and provides necessities that each individual needs, such as health care, medication, food, transport, and so on. If you think about this as a small business and your employee wasn't doing a good job, you would influence them in some way to have a positive outcome E.g. could be done by, the news.This company would need a manager to manage the business. A family needs a leader to make decisions.The news, intended to keep us within the construct and avoid bad things although, there's a line between propaganda and realistic news. My theory is that on one hand, it's the rebel against the construct or fits into the construct scenario.If you knew that brainwashing could have a positive influence, would you let it happen? E.g. brainwashed to stop smoking - Hypnosis as a real world example.They want us to be sheep because it helps the world operate.

You can usually tease this out by finding where the third rails in discussions about groups are. You can also find this in what a society chooses to worship and commemorate vs what they disdain and spit upon. This is pretty easy to do in the west.

You will be able to decipher comments from Presidents, Congress, anyone in the Media.The why of its use, is not encryption of high technology, but is spread thru Broadcasting to a wide audience with no specific recipients, which allows near silent secreted communications that cannot be detected with a computer, right in front of your face everyday and night.I have been publishing online about it since about 2013, and uploaded a Webster Paperback Dictionary that seems the be the 'Go To' Key, or at least sufficient enough to decipher Keyed Messages.This manipulation has an evil twist in that after 7 years of observation, I do not believe that the subjects utilizing the Language are consciously aware of their participation, which means the Human population is being subliminally influenced by something else. Call it God, The Devil, Spirit, of the Dead, Ghosts, Apparitions, ET, or whatever you want.The example I will share has enough aspects of provable coincidence to suggest that the manipulating force has a longer life span than Humans, and that in light of the facts, also means that the daily goings on of Mankind include proof of Predestination.So, the importance you lend to it could mean the difference developing a more complete understanding of what it means to Society, and making new, more significant discoveries.Let me know what You Think about it.Tracy MapesDictionary Key 213mb Free/No Ad Download[ Discovery Article - Author Tracy Mapes[ Important Imagery related to "Two-Talking" at the top level of the U.S. Government and the current Presidential Election cycle.[ Harris AKA Carla Barros, False Identity Infiltration[

<|endoftext|>I think watching these debates it shows the power of organic internet media to become a strong and relentless propaganda force. The dream of the internet allowing fact checking and a culture that escaped from political propaganda is dead, social media and the internet have caused people to internalize that propaganda. The "media" as a force has been diluted I think. We used to know politicians were lying to us because it was the role, but now everyone willingly believes lies because it's the role. The medias role as propaganda has extended in to people as well.No matter your politics I think it's important to see how the right-wing internet media machine created a narrative that Joe Biden was barely coherent and incapable of speaking a handful of sentences. 4chan, news, reddit, subreddits, podcasts, youtube, twitter, memes - all of them relentlessly filled the internet with the narrative it was elder abuse and he didn't know where he was. Relentless discussion of how he can barely think straight and couldn't comprehend basic sentences. It wasn't gaffes, here's 100 youtube videos of "political commentators" reacting like soyboys talking about how he'd soil his diaper.I think it's an objective measure that Biden is nowhere, nowhere, near the level that became constant internet narrative. Remember it being everywhere, remember all the commentators, remember joe rogan and his guests, remember how pervasive a fake reality became. The internet is an internalized propaganda in a degenerate culture that has worn down human experience.The mass media and political lies are now the internal identity of the population. The left wing version is more in your face now the democrats have become mid-2000s republicans in terms of naive unthinking mainstream culture, but the internet media is equally destructive. It is hard to escape these days.

<|endoftext|># The Psychology Of Propaganda: War Tool Turned Marketing Tactic BY JUSTINE DAMIANO PUBLISHED OCT 16, 2018 *Propaganda and war generally go hand in hand. After World War I, however, propaganda became a marketing tool no longer reserved for posters of the enemy and national spirit. It evolved to become the calculated manipulation of emotions and societal desires to psychologically influence a buyer to purchase goods. Like war itself, propaganda is calculated and formulated with an attack plan that includes allies and enemies.* "Propaganda works by manipulating and exploiting our emotions and needs. It uses hopped-up slogans and plays on our hopes and fears to evoke a desired response. But when did propaganda begin to enter our homes and everyday lives? It all began with World War I. The end of this war brought about changes to the world. Included among those changes was the advent of a new kind of propaganda that reached far past political cartoons and slogans to influence our daily decisions."[

<|endoftext|>WRONG.The entire entertainment mediaplex writ large worldwide is super hard left in that they are essentially communists in disguise, pushing what ultimately leads to a communist agenda - and if you dont like the label communist, thats fine because it is just ANOTHER useless label for what **IT** really is:*A binary 2 class/caste system. One of a tiny elite (self appointed and self-insulating) rulership, and a great unwashed class of serfs.*This societal system is the dominant one all throughout history because it coincides with human nature, which presents as greed and dominance seeking in some and subservience and insecurity in others. Nearly all societies have been organized as 2 class systems (using various names like communism that merely reflect internal mechanisms or ideology, and are all irrelevant).Any society that **ATTEMPTS** to be different than this default will continually be under assault from without and especially from within to get back to this structure, because they are based on human behavior itself, which is not changeable except in the long view of evolution (IOW super slowly and beyond our abilities to directly control). And few even realize this.The US Constitution codifies a very rare departure, for example, with THREE classes, class mobility in both directions, and express rights for the lower classes and limitations on the upper ones and government itself. This is of course unacceptable to those looking to enshrine and codify their own dominance. Therefore, you see what we are witnessing right now in US politics (with media as the complicit ally of the elite class) What is interesting to me is just how obvious this big picture has become since Trumps election. Im not saying Trump himself has done anything to change it, but his election sure has exposed the reality of it all, even if only by merit of being able to observe the vicious reaction by the would-be ruling class.

To acknowledge what you're saying takes a degree of psychological strength, particularly for older people. You think you've lived your entire life  fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty years  in a world of a certain kind, and suddenly you discover that the whole thing has just been a charade, in which you have willingly but unwittingly participated. You yourself have been a kind of puppet pulled about malevolent and shadowy men who have, through you, worked toward the destruction of everything you thought you were preserving. That's hardly an easy prospect for anyone to accept. We who are on the other side of the veil have to be able to understand the hesitation of such people and to approach them with a degree of compassion. It's often the best part of them which stops them from seeing what's going on; that's the same solid point we have to leverage on.

<|endoftext|>Niccol Machiavelli was a diplomat for 14 years in Italy's Florentine Republic during the Medici family's exile. When the Medici family returned to power in 1512, Machiavelli was dismissed and briefly jailed. He then wrote *The Prince*, a handbook for politicians on the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning, inspiring the term "Machiavellian" and establishing Machiavelli as the "father of modern political theory." He also wrote several poems and plays. He died on June 21, 1527, in Florence, Italy'The Prince'Though it was initially a dark period for his career, Machiavelli's time away from politics gave him the opportunity to read Roman history and to write political treatises, most notably *The Prince*. The main theme of this short work about monarchal rule and survival is man's capacity for determining his own destiny in opposition to the power of fate, which has been interpreted as the political philosophy that one may resort to any means in order to establish and preserve total authority. The work has been regarded as a handbook for politicians on the use of ruthless, self-serving cunning, and inspired the term "Machiavellian." While many believe that the book's title character, "the prince," was based upon the infamous Cesare Borgia, some scholars consider it a satire.Pope Clement VIII condemned *The Prince* for its endorsement of rule by deceit and fear. One excerpt from the book reads: "Since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved."\------------------------------------------***Discourse on Voluntary Servitude. -*** [tienne de La Botie]( ***Discourse on Voluntary Servitude*** ([French]( *Discours de la servitude volontaire*) is a work attributed to [tienne de La Botie]( by Montaigne. The text was published [clandestinely]( in 1577.The date of preparation of the *Discourse on Voluntary Servitude* is uncertain: according to recent studies it was composed by tienne de La Botie during his university education. According to his closest friend [Michel de Montaigne]( the speech was written when La Botie was about 18 years old.The essay argues that any [tyrant]( remains in power while his subjects grant him that, therefore delegitimizing every form of power. The original freedom of men would be indeed abandoned by society which, once corrupted by the [habit]( would have preferred the servitude of the courtier to the freedom of the free man, who refuses to be submissive and to obey.This relation between domain and obedience would be resumed later by [anarchist thinkers]( [Lew Rockwell]( summarizes La Boties political philosophy as follows:To him, the great mystery of politics was obedience to rulers. Why in the world do people agree to be looted and otherwise oppressed by government overlords? It is not just fear, Boetie explains in The Discourse on Voluntary Servitude, for our consent is required. And that consent can be non-violently withdrawn.[\[2\]]( La Botie explores the subjective bond which ties us to the power that dominates us, which enthrals and seduces us, blinds us and mesmerizes us. The essential lesson here is that the power cannot rely on coercion, but in reality rests on our power. Our active acquiescence to power at the same time constitutes this power. For La Botie, then, in order to resist the tyrant, all we need do is turn our backs on him, withdraw our active support from him and perceive, through the illusory spell that power manages to cast over us  an illusion that we participate in  his weakness and vulnerability. Servitude, then, is a condition of our own making  it is entirely voluntary; and all it takes to untie us from this condition is the desire to no longer be subjugated, the will to be free.This problem of voluntary servitude is the exact opposite of that raised by Hobbes a century later. Whereas for La Botie, it is unnatural for us to be subjected to absolute power, for Hobbes it is unnatural for us to live in any other condition; the anarchy of the state of nature, for Hobbes, is precisely an unnatural and unbearable situation. La Boties problematic of self-domination thus inverts a whole tradition of political theory based on legitimizing the sovereign  a tradition that is still very much with us today. La Botie starts from the opposite position, which is that of the primacy of liberty, self-determination and the natural bonds of family and companionship, as opposed to the unnatural, artificial bonds of political domination. Liberty is something which must be protected not so much against those who wish to impose their will on us, but against our own temptation to relinquish our liberty, to be dazzled by authority, to barter away our liberty in return for wealth, positions, favours, and so on. What must be explained, then, is the pathological bond to power which displaces the natural desire for liberty and the free bonds that exist between people.

Heck even many indigenous societies today do not act this way. The middle class in america was a blip in human history and it came at the oppression of many and it has practically disappeared today proving Marx's critique of capitalism was correct as we watch it slip back into Feudalism (as you point out).I will take Chomsky (the single most cited living academic) over a random reddit commenter any day of the week.

<|endoftext|>lulz Fox may sigh his check, but there not the ones with the tapes of him ("doing things") on JE's Island if u no what i mean.
<|endoftext|>I was not against it. I was taken by how forward they were in presenting themselves to a target audience.I notice outlets today trying to "be for everybody".Also, you got me with information I was not aware of, so touche'!
<|endoftext|>Lol like i said Im not a crack pot tin foil hat guy, I just have unpopular opinions that do not follow main stream science
<|endoftext|>Preaching to the choir. The Boston Bombing was particularly eye-opening for me due to how much raw footage could be scrutinized.

<|endoftext|>True, but when it was codified as illegal there was at least a pretense that the IC had checks and balances. NSA Director James Clapper lied to Congress in 2013 and not a thing was done despite Snowden's whistleblowing. The CIA spied on Senator Feinstein and the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2014 and nothing was done despite an internal CIA investigation verifying the accusation. I suppose the IC during the days of J Edgar Hoover were just as underhanded but the pretense of any true accountability is dead and buried.
<|endoftext|>Any relation to Tony Schwartz? He wrote that book about Trump, The Art of The Deal, then later became an anti-Trumper. Also in Epstein's black book, I believe.
<|endoftext|>Wow, good catch. I've must've made comments regarding that bill about half a dozen times and you're the first to ask about that. Looks like I've been spreading misinformation because it seems to have died in committee.
<|endoftext|>Scratch my previous reply; it was bundled in as a provision of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. So yes, it's law.
<|endoftext|>It's more than that, though. The article was so loaded and poorly worded that it makes it difficult to suss out the info. Then you have shills in the comments upvoting each other, trying their best to hide the misinformation. We're living in a fucked up time, right now.
<|endoftext|>And whats worse is that the unseen movers know that most people skip past the article and go straight for the comment section. The article will already be one degree if not two degrees removed from primary substance. You can control interpretation of data, you can control interpretations of the interpreted data. But people are losing faith in established experts so there are moving in mass to this weird third degree data interpretation(comment section). Every time this data goes to the next degree of separation it splinters where then it splinters again. My problem is that by the time the information hits your average Joe/Jane the information is highly speculative and very far from the truth.Read the article only to find the primary source. Then throw whatever interpretation your reading into the trash. Read for your self. Think for yourself. Independence is of the good.
<|endoftext|>I highly recommend searching the history of this sub for discussions on any topic you find interesting enough to research. This sub has a decade of archived threads to delve through. Pushshift is an extremely underutilized resource; much better than reddit's native search function.
<|endoftext|>If people are capable of formatting a post well it doesn't prove they are good at research and fact checking, but it makes it more likely. Intelligence is about understanding patterns. Grammar and spelling have patterns. It is hard to write with more clarity than exists in your mind. So I'll always have more time for a clear writer.
<|endoftext|> go read Peter Kropotkin or CLOSELY read Darwin to see that even he didnt believe human or animal nature are as you claim.then I will agree to disagree with them, if that is truly what they claim. Look around you, look at all human history. look at all societies. And you would dispute this? Capitalism is another ideological construct label like communism, they are both attempts to describe and define the economies of such systems, not their societal structure.Societal structures and economic systems are 2 different things.The middle class in america was a blip in human historythats as I said. non binary (more than 2 classes/castes) societal constructs are very rare. The US Constitution codifying such has almost never been seen, other variants are most often only symbolically different but are still 2 class in practice.it came at the oppression of many and it has practically disappeared todayThere always has been and always will be "oppression", it is not possible to eradicate this. Why? Human nature, as I said. Please provide evidence that a 3rd class (middle class) "came at the oppression of many". I would argue that it (along with class mobility) provided an avenue for class ADVANCEMENT that has always in history been SQUASHED by the upper class.we watch it slip back into Feudalism Again, feudalism is just another label for 2 classes. One of elites, one of serfs. You are proving my point.I will take Chomsky (the single most cited living academic) over a random reddit commenter any day of the week.How very intellectual of you. Kudos, and have a great day.
<|endoftext|>It actually is done on every new station, tv commercial, movie, and tv show. The CIA owns the whole network. The bloggers and journalism is a good point, but thats also why you see independent bloggers get defamed as much as possible. The internet is in one of the largest book burnings in history right now, with mass deletion of information.
<|endoftext|>Yes, I know all too well what you mean  particularly when family or friends are involved. It's like watching them walking blindfold toward the precipice of some abyss, and not being able to help them.
<|endoftext|>Thanks, u/MiltownKBs, for pushing me to do some research.I am putting this here as an example of how charm can turn people. Apparently, the new editor of the 'Censor' promoted the Democratic Party.This first slashed his profits, but he regained them with his Editorials:**The Fredonia Censor editor's obituaries**Mr. Bickers ... purchased the Fredonia Censor some eight years ago (in 1923) and made it Democratic in politics, the only Democratic newspaper, by the way, in Chautauqua county (NY State). Notwithstanding the political policy, which had little support in Chautauqua county, Mr. Bickers made the newspaper so entertaining that it had a good circulation and support. His editorial comment on men and manners measured up to a somewhat higher standard than is usually the case with a weekly village newspaper.  --Jamestown Journal Very few weekly newspapers have an editorial page so entertaining as that of Mr.Bickers in the Censor.  --Jamestown Morning Post The first astonishing thing he [Bickers] did was to place the Censor in the Democratic column, though it had for over one hundred years appeared weekly as staunch Republican, and Republican organization sheet at that. This move on the part of the new owner of the Censor cut his subscription list about 75 per cent, but that meant nothing to a man of the type of Fred C. Bickers. Opposition to his program simply brought out the best there was in him and by making the Censor one of the best, if not the best weekly newspapers published in Western New York, he not only regained all of his lost subscribers, but added materially to his subscription list until at the time of his death his newspaper enjoyed one of the largest circulations of any newspaper of its class.
<|endoftext|>Edward Snowden's whistle-blowering seemed to have softened the moron millions into accepting this gargantuan invasion of privacy and massive surveillance-state. Like it was scary when they weren't sure they were being monitored, being unsure of who's watching them. But now that they know for sure, it's somewhat reassuring if not totally benign. They feel safe now that they know their government can watch over them like an omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, patriotic bald eagle watches over its nest of little fledgling chicks. Queue Bill Hicks instructing us, and reassuring us, to "Go back to bed, America. Your government has figured it all out  You're free to do as we tell you." "WhAt?

As if any one of us can't be defamed in a guilt-by-association smear campaign. Look at what eBay execs did to a couple published negative reviews about their service! And that's just a mid-sized e-commerce site. Bona-fide gangstalking! Snowden, or rather John Brennan's bestie /s, Glen "the Gatekeeper" Greenwald, didn't reveal anything that already wasn't either known or suspected. They filled in some blanks, and while Greenwald has removed the Snowden Files from public access, Snowden is feeding usfuck me, I'm going to say itnothing burgers, vis--vis Roe Jogan's podcast.

<|endoftext|>There is a solid case to be made that the Boston Marathon bombing was a live-action trauma exercise and that case is only as solid as it is due to how much photographic evidence there was of the immediate aftermath. The Boston Unbombing is a video I'd recommend as the maker does a good job of showcasing various props used in live trauma exercises and demonstrates many of those props were likely used that day.It's barely scratching the surface but the most smoking gun piece of evidence is how the remnants of one of the exploded backpacks appears to be darker than either backpack the Tsarnaev brothers were seen with. Military-looking fellows wearing uniform outfits with possible ties to Craft International, a mercenary company founded by Chris Kyle of American Sniper fame (who had been murdered two months prior), can be seen a block down the street with backpacks that look extremely similar to the one taken into evidence.Edit: remanence -- remnants
<|endoftext|>they said a few hundred injuries bur if you look where the firecracker went off, only a few were close. The fireworks were set off by a guy in a white hoody and a guy in a black hoody. The Tsarnev bros were patsies.

<|endoftext|>Thank you. This what I thought you meant. Its been bugging me for years that most people seemed to just shrug off these things. Also the fact that Ive never seen anything but a few still photographs and a court portrait of the Tsarnaev brother. No perpwalk into or out of the custody or court like say, El Chapo, Dylan Roof, or others that have murdered many many others. Some would argue law enforcement wanted to avoid it because he is a terrorist. Nevertheless, the argument never sat right with me.
<|endoftext|>Where can we find this video? YouTube is pretty much a non-option now, they have taken everything off of it and blocked so many conspiracies
<|endoftext|>One of my peer in school, middle school boy at the time. Ran in that race and was hit with shrapnel. We went to school on the west coast and he had to fly to participate in the event. His family are all avid marathon runners and he was a football player for our school. The video suggests he was a crisis actor. But I remember seeing him in casts and crutches for years after due to shrapnel getting lodged in his leg. This sort of makes it harder to believe as I knew someone involved.
<|endoftext|>But the real rabbit hole is this: What if these kinds of videos are the ones meant to program you?I've always had this thought that conspiracy theories could be in fact engineered and seeded by the government, in order to "bugs bunny" the conspiracy theorists, by making them sound crazy to normal people."conspiracy theorist" already has a negative connotation. Imagine they leak this type of information, after which it can be called a conspiracy theory, and then via reverse psychology, civilians will be quick to dismiss it, due to the connotation around that phrase.Think about if you're playing a game of Among Us or a game where there is a traitor in your group, and you have to find out who it is.Someone saying jokingly, at the beginning of the game, "it's me", will initially cause most players to think "haha, well it's probably not them then". one or two may say "well I think it *is* you", and then the rest can be gaslighted into believing it was simply a joke.
<|endoftext|>Awesome. Any other reddit or research tools you guys use? - findarelatedreddit tool, not sure the actual name- Evernote to store snippets from this sub (has great search feature) & the free Evernote web clipper - I check www.ceddit.com/r/conspiracy/new to see what posts in this sub get removed/censored. Some good stuff falls through the cracks due to people overlooking SS requirements. Page is slow but worth a gander.
<|endoftext|>Thats not really how the internet works though is it? Its a distributed network. Anyone can build a server any country and start publishing what ever they like.  I have built web servers all over the world.
<|endoftext|>That makes complete sense. If I knew someone personally who was harmed in the attack and saw their painstaking recovery first-hand,I would simply believe it at face-value. In fact, I would likely be offended by those who expressed doubts.But I don't have that personal connection, so all I have to base my opinion on is video footage, police reports, documentaries, and eyewitness testimonials. And I find The Boston Unbombing a persuasive piece of work.
<|endoftext|>I agree with this statement, the term "Conspiracy Theory" was coined by the CIA during the investigation of JFK's assassination. They used the term to discredit anything that opposed the narrative. As most of us know JFKs assasination is one of the biggest conspiracies to date.
<|endoftext|>I think this is a real possibility. There are a hundred solid psychological reasons for "people in the know" to want to muddy the public water as much as possible with narratives and counter-narratives and counter-counter-narratives. I think this is regularly done with pretty much any hotbutton issue you can think of, from Covid to aliens to race relations.So the question: in our "postmodern" age of fragmentation and compounding, often malicious disinformation, how do we find our way to solid ground?
<|endoftext|>Perhaps they would. I don't hold any animosity toward those individuals and certainly wouldn't initiate any form of contact myself, though.I get that if it wasn't a live action crisis exercise then my providing more exposure to that video is a shitty thing to do for those involved in the incident and it's a good reminder that these are people with families.However, I found many of the points raised in the video to be sound and much of the analysis of footage taken shortly after the explosions compelling, and therefore will continue to share it when relevant. If you find any debunking or fact-checking source that addresses the material points made in the film I'd welcome it.
<|endoftext|>That's the main one. For locating videos I tend to try doing a domain search engine query of bitchute (that website's search tool is even worse than reddit's) or archive.org (which incidentally often has the side effect of granting full access to articles which are otherwise hidden behind paywalls).I'll need to try that ceddit idea considering how often I see posts removed due to lack of SS when browsing by new.

<|endoftext|>Science nowadays most certainly IS a belief system. The term settled science is an oxymoron first of all, and secondly is dogmatic as fuck, but thats where science is at right now, especially when it involves COVID.
<|endoftext|>You're in luck - I looked into that question myself a couple days ago. As far as I can tell, the YouTube account that gets the credit was called New Liberty Times. Then the video was quickly mirrored by the Tyranny News Network channel (which was the first one posted to reddit on 9/20/16) before they were both taken down a couple weeks later according to a reddit comment that attributed New Liberty Times as the original.They're no longer on YouTube, but there's a bitchute channel with their name that includes a copy of this film, so probably the same group. The bad news is that this is the only film on that channel and no activity there for over two years.
<|endoftext|>There's probably a term for whats taking place. Unless we change the definition for what science is, the shit you bring up most certainly is not science.
<|endoftext|>Alright heres the synopsis of what i think is going on with the et/ufo phenomenon. These conclusions are based on whistleblower testimonies and, more specifically, the common threads that run through them. Ive also tried to sift out the disinformation pushed by the US government. I cant prove all of this but i think it is an overall accurate snapshot of whats going on.Sometime in the 1930's Nazi Germany made contact with entities from elsewhere and obtained some advanced technology. This advanced tech was the foundation of various anti-gravity/time manipulation technologies being studied by german rocket scientists at Pina Munde and other top-secret locations. The US and the Soviet Union became aware of some of this and, after the war, both sides made haste to bring these Nazi scientists to their countries and straight into black projects. In this US this was done through Operation Paperclip. In 1947 two craft crashed in New Mexico. One crashed near Corrona the other crashed many miles away, likely near Magdalena. The craft at Corrona was discovered in July 1947, the other craft wasn't discovered until 1949. Inside the craft in 1947 we discovered ET bodies and, more importantly and ominously, the mutilated bodies of airforce personnel. This caused the classification of of the subject to jump from secret to way way above top secret. As a consequence of this, the CIA and the NSA were both established. In fact the whole intelligence apparatus as we know it was established as a direct consequence of what was discovered near Roswell in 1947. The whole issue was buried deep in unacknowledged special access programs and very few knew the whole story. We began trying to learn from and duplicate the technology but progress was slow-rolling to put it mildly. Even so, aspects of the ET technology were incorporated into the stealth-fighter programs. After Truman Eisenhower was sworn in and given the whole scoop. Eventually it was arranged for him to meet with the entities so as to figure out what they wanted and to come to some kind of an understanding. This meeting in fact happened in 1954, when Eisenhower disappeared, and the press was given the story that he saw a dentist for a tooth ache. A basic non-interference agreement was reached with these entities. It was essentially a negotiated surrender, as we were literally helpless to in any way stand against these things. The entities wanted genetic material and claimed that humans would not be harmed. They wouldnt interfere with our civilization and we would not disclose their presence or in any way interfere with their operations. It was hoped that this arrangement would prevent ET hostilities. Despite this agreement we kept learning of abductions and discovered mutilated humans and animals all across the world. It was determined that these entities were harvesting genetic material for some unknown purpose. It is likely these entities were manufacturing biological drone organisms which would be capable of existing on and interfacing with our planet and/or dimension. In fact it was discovered that the ETs we found in the crashes were actually part of the craft themselves, and operated as biological guidance systems. Whatever intelligence is behind all of this is creating artificially intelligent biological organisms to interface with us and accomplish their purposes. The US government considers these entities to be hostile agents and has been developing, since the 50's, advanced weapons systems and space platforms to be able to counter these beings.It was decided that the truth could not be handled by the public, but yet had to be revealed eventually. So the government has embarked on a slow-drip disclosure campain which began in the 50's and continues to this day. Weve been slowly conditioned to accept the ET presence and the disclosure has ramped up in recent years. The Space Force has existed for quite some time now, in fact NASA was nothing more than the low-level public face of it for decades. Full disclosure, excepting the really nasty stuff (missing persons and human mutilations), is imminent. And thats it, a brief synopsis of what may in fact really be going on. And hey even if its all bullshit it sure is a good story!
<|endoftext|>Does anyone else get a little nervous as to how close our world is to following the plot from X Files?!Im not nervous, you are.
<|endoftext|>I would need to make a whole long post but TLDR:'Alien presence is a mixture of genuine ET visits but also remains of advanced ancient technology spanning from 100,000-32,000 years ago. Humans were much more advanced than we currently are but have been reset multiple times, it's the biggest cover up in human history. The UFO's found by the Nazi's in Antarctica belonged to humans 80,000+ years ago, they just turned it into an ET meme to distract the public like they always do.The goddamn technology found in Antarctica is so advanced and foreign, even we can't retro engineer most of it. I do however believe there is genuine ET aliens, the event in Brazil 2005  is scary, not to mention the one in Africa where loads of schoolkids saw an alien. Their accounts are way too realistic to be false.
<|endoftext|>We're the only shitters on the planet who can't drink the water and have no fur. Our genes were created off-world and brought here. We arrived either *a.* as fully formed humanoid beings on a spacecraft, or *b.* as a soup of nutrients assembled by robot and squeezed out through a mechanical womb after arrival.Keeping in mind cosmic distances, unless we're from Proxima Centauri we were probably spawned from an unmanned craft. I'd point radio telescopes toward our nearest stellar neighbor for answers. Still, I'm betting money we were transported through space as embryos or similar.
<|endoftext|> just feel like posting my take on the subject, and please forgive me for English is not my native language.I believe that there is at least one species of animal that is more advanced than humans, and that lives on this planet. They have evolved from the same origin as us, but they did it under water.The first animal to go from water to land had to take lots of time to adapt to its new environment, while those that stayed in the water could just keep evolving. We have evolved from the first land-animal to becoming what we are today. But why couldn't the same evolutionary progress have happened under water?Let's say there is an underwater species that has a headstart in cognitive evolution and they have created technology that is thousands of years ahead of ours.To take a hypothetical example: If we wanted to convince chimpanzees that humans don't exist, we could have easily done it. And they would sometimes see a human or an airplane, tell their chimp-buddies about it, and get called a crazy conspiracy theorist.I don't know wether or not this theory has ever been looked into, but if someone has any evidence pointing in this direction I would be very interested. I would also like to hear arguments to why this theory is most likely false.
<|endoftext|>Here's my take on the Alien Presence on EarthI've not shared this with anyone (no reason to I guess) but below are my own thoughts on the situation.- Genesis (Bible) says that the Sons of God mated with the sons of man -- The fallen angels mated with humans.- The book of Enoch (Non-canonical, I know) goes into a lot of detail about this, and even if non-biblical, the ancient Israelites believed it. Quite a few ancient cultures had the same stories. - These offspring were destroyed and their celestial parents (the fallen angels which mated with humans) were cast into an eternal prison for their actions (titans in greek mythology much?)- This is where ghosts / demons come from. The disembodied spirits of the unholy offspring are left to wander the earth. It's why they can possess living material creatures.  Half human, half celestial in nature, when they died, their spirits remained but their bodies were gone.- The "Aliens" are the now released (from their prison / banishment / whatever) celestial parents trying to have more offspring. - For some reason, they are unable to do whatever they did before and are seeking alternative ways to make it happen. - This is why they abduct humans into their craft. They do experiments. They "take samples" etc. As always, take it with a grain of salt. It's just my own thoughts on the matter.Why would aliens travel across the galaxy to experiment with humans? Seems like a waste of their time overall.
<|endoftext|>Came for the links to the "Tic Tac"s, and was horribly disappointed to see I'm the first. video shows a 2004 encounter near San Diego between two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets and an unknown object. It was released by the Defense Department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.CreditCredit...U.S Department of DefenseHovering 50 feet above the churn was an aircraft of some kind  whitish  that was around 40 feet long and oval in shape. The craft was jumping around erratically, staying over the wave disturbance but not moving in any specific direction, Commander Fravor said. The disturbance looked like frothy waves and foam, as if the water were boiling.I have no idea what I saw, Commander Fravor replied to the pilot. It had no plumes, wings or rotors and outran our F-18s.But, he added, I want to fly one. program has also studied video that shows a whitish oval object described as a giant Tic Tac, about the size of a commercial plane, encountered by two Navy fighter jets off the coast of San Diego in 2004.And no, it wasn't Star Lord's dad...

<|endoftext|>In Joe Rogan Experience Episode 1299, Annie Jacobsen, an American investigative journalist, author (and 2016 Pulitzer Prize finalist in history), mentions at [9:05]( (Youtube timestamp) that her Source with a [Q Clearance]( was and I paraphrase:*A major player in the Manhattan Project. He went on and worked in the atomic energy commission. Theres a wing of a museum named after him. His accolades his awards were so extraordinary. He recently died, and gave me permission to write about him after his death.*The Source told her that the Roswell incident was Stalin sending surgically modified children in experimental Nazi hovering discs into American territory to create a War of the Worlds type panic inside USA. Stalin did it also to demonstrate that USSR was ahead of USA in aerospace technologies, although USSR did not have the Atom Bomb, while having better Black Propaganda capabilities.The Source also confessed that US Government (i.e. DOE a.k.a Atomic Energy Commission a.k.a NNSS) also had done surgical/genetic experimentation on mentally challenged children to see if they can replicate what Stalin did.Annie Jacobsen does not reveal the name of her Source, and saves it for her next book (maybe). But given the information above I was able to mine [WikiData]( and come up with an answer. Here is how I did it:First I wrote a SPARQL Query for [Wikidata Query Service]((WDQS)  SELECT ?person ?personLabel ?death  WHERE   {  ?person wdt:P1344 wd:Q127050.  ?person wdt:P570 ?death  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". }  }  ORDER BY DESC(?death)What it does is it finds people involved in the Manhattan project and sorts them by how recently they died (because Annie said the Source died recently).

They are not here to war against us, nor to save us. The kingdom of heaven is now, always now. You never needed to be saved. Ya needed to learn how to forgive, most of all our selfs. Do not condemn and you will not be condemned, do not judge and you will not be judged, do not fear and you will not know danger... lots of lessons... But we will not find U.F.Os aliens until we find each of our own internal lights/truth/path... the very void you fear with in.. that ya fill, or need to saved from, the hole that something needs to fill.... or ya need to evolve, raise your consciousness, or reach enlightenment, need to just make that much, or be with someone... whatever fucking thing your striving for... that distraction is distracting you from.. found it interesting newest buzz from talking newsworthy head says galactic federation says we are not ready... well no shit. Yall cant even get scared with out hoard toilet paper.Being. Thought, what most hear a voice internally... ego, subconscious, fight or flight response to stimuli... Focus on ya breath Breathe in for three seconds..Hold for three seconds...Exhale for three seconds....Pause for three seconds...Repeat...The person who does with out being... ya know that person who drives ya home but you cant consciously remember being prescient while you did it...To be or not to be? Its always been the question folks. Aliens aint doing shit for none of us, any more then any of you fucks are doing for the Bees. We need bees, maybe they need us... but like I said... This search for aliens... Hawking was correct, leads to nothing positive.The answers are within, and the time is always now. .
<|endoftext|>Think noone is disputing their existence anymore. It's pretty obvious even if they do every but confirm it. Seems like they have known about us for thousands of years but only really took any real notice when we started detonating atom bombs. Physics have already showed that atoms are linked through dimensions so exploding them in one I expect will have a ripple effect. And if you're an inter dimensional being you're probably gonna notice that. Explains why there's been hundreds of reports at nuclear bases. To be fair though, to them, we are just chimps that created dynamite. Interesting to go watch but also to make sure it doesn't get out of control.I expect contact was made around that time also and a warning issued.
<|endoftext|>I can't accept that they're so advanced yet needed our permission to harvest animal and human dna and then leave mutilated animal corpses laying around. If they're so advanced, they could have literally abducted people and animals without a traceAnd I also find it hard to believe that their craft would crash. I so believe there are aliens but I don't buy the official story or the various suppositions ive come across thus far
<|endoftext|>gov is swabbing throats and nose for alien dna thats been passed down, not covid.have fun with that one.
<|endoftext|>Just like all the other assholes out there, I can't offer any proof- but I can tell you that we are not alone. I don't think we ever were. Two different factions/species are involved with our own, at minimum.
<|endoftext|>they've been here longer than we have. we know nothing of our origins or our real history. he who controls the past controls the future....
<|endoftext|>The one 'thingy' I saw behaved like a probe. It flew down the length of Silicon Valley, bisecting the valley just below mountain top level. It didn't turn or change speed until the very end. Over the decades I pondered, okay, it was obviously not of this world yet it was doing what any surveillance drone or space probe might have done, as if it was monitoring, recording everything, the way we do when we do a planet fly by with our probes or surveil the surface of the earth with our satellites.
<|endoftext|>There is absolutely evidence of aliens already, with human pig hybrids being created and organs being harvested in scientific biological research labs in China as I type this. A chimera is very real. You just havent seen one yet. You will soon.
<|endoftext|>What I know for sure, is that UFO sightings have gone down drastically since we all have cameras in our pockets.
<|endoftext|>I am an alien abductee. They have not been very forthcoming with /why/ I'm being abducted, but I suspect it has something to do with them altering my genetic material. I have many 'dreams' where I am telekenetic, and I strongly suspect I am being used to build things for ET parties.I have encountered small and tall greys, as well as Mantids. I've had some milab experiences.My regular therapist and hypnotherapist both believe me.Also my mother was born in West Germany on a US military base. She is also an abductee/experiencer.
<|endoftext|>They are working behind the scenes. They are smart to do their best to not reveal themselves. They are probably in cahoots with world governments and are actively working alongside personnel in secret bases.
<|endoftext|>This thread needs to read about Ezekiel's vision of time-traveling life forms right in the middle of the Bible, in the ancient book of the prophet:

<|endoftext|>I know reddit is a terrible place for this debate, but I'll continue to chip in anyway. **Martial Law. Marshalling. Marching. Mergers. Martyrdom. Murder.** These familiar terms of conquest are named after the planet of conquest: **Mars**. The origins of these words suggest systems of control imposed upon us by humans who associate themselves with the planet Mars.## Q: How can humans survive on Mars?On the inside. All planets are [hollow]( Not [Flat]( [Hollow]( nicer on the inside, however resources are limited. This is why they have to leach off of Earth's resources.## Q: Why haven't I heard about this theory before?Well, maybe you have!**No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century...** **that the twentieth century would label over 300 years of Mars Literature as 'Science Fiction'.**### Early Mars Literature[Athanasius Kircher]( (16021680), [Emanuel Swedenborg]( (16881772), and others wrote in detail about Earth contact with Mars, including the first voyages to the planet, sometimes as an invasion force, more often for the purposes of exploration.In 1784, [Sir William Herschel]( British Astronomer Royal, studied Mars with telescopes he built himself. Herschel believed that ALL the planets were inhabited and that there were even intelligent beings living in a cool area under the surface of the Hollow Sun!### Giovanni Exposes Mars to the PublicIn 1877, [Giovanni Schiaparelli]( observed a dense network of linear structures on the surface of Mars which he called "canali" (Channels in Italian).### Percival Lowell Maps Mars in DetailFrom 1880 to 1895, [Percival Lowell]( studied Mars extensively at his observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and made intricate drawings of canals, oases, cities, and other "non-natural features". He described in detail the vast skein of mechanically constructed canal systems that traversed the red planet unmistakably grown around the Antarctic regions. Lowell then published his views in three books: Mars (1895), Mars and Its Canals (1906), and Mars As the Abode of Life (1908).  It is a direct sequitur from this that the planet is at present the abode of intelligent constructive life, I may say in this connection that the theory of such life upon Mars was in no way an a priori hypothesis on my part, but deduced from the outcome of observation, and that my observations since have fully confirmed it. No other supposition is consonant with all the facts here. - Percival Lowell (New York Times 1907)&#x200B;### Lowell announces Life on Mars 1907, and then dies. LoL!!~After making this announcement in the New York Times, as often happens, his health mysteriously and rapidly deteriorated. He died from a stroke in the middle of World War One on November 12, 1916, aged 61 and is buried on Mars Hill near his Flagstaff observatory. Lowell's announcement had the power to change the world in **positive** ways that nobody could have foreseen, but instead, his announcement was perceived as a threat by the controlling faction of inhabitants of Mars.**If Martians influenced War on Earth, it is logical that World War 1 may have been triggered by Lowell's announcement of Life on Mars**. Shortly after this, World War One changed the world in **negative** ways that [nobody could have foreseen]( Q: Okay, why can't we see any signs of civilization on the surface of Mars today?Poisoning Lowell wouldn't be enough. World War 1 and 2 wouldn't be enough. Lowell's discovery of Life on Mars must never be repeated. If the cities and other "non-natural features" were observable on Mars, the jig would be up. All cities and canals would all have to be removed. All the Humans who lived in these cities would have to return to the inner realms. Those who refused would have to be convinced.The solution was simple: **turn off the water**.While WWI and WWII reorganized Earth, there was a Reorganization on MarsAs soon as the water stopped flowing into the cities, they were abandoned. The abandoned cities were then destroyed by the same automated machines that built them. This is one reason why [city ruins]( tend to be found on Mars. In 1962, the [Mariner missions]( observed Mars at close range, seeing no water, no cities, and no signs of life.**Therefore, it is possible that all Martian surface cities were dismantled between 1918 and 1960.**The same Humans who contrived The Great Wars of the 20th Century to dominate Earth at the same time dominated Mars.[ to see here, move along

If it would have stayed it would have formed the thunderbird doodem.

<|endoftext|>Venting: I guess England did manage to get away with _taxing Americans into poverty,_ and creating feudalist states with their Eurocentric progressive policies and propaganda that ruined cities in California and Manhattan itself.Youll still to this day (outside of Texas probably, because these foreign bottom feeders have _metastasized_ to that place) encounter more authentic Russian, Chinese, Arab, African and South American accents, _at every income level_ nationwide, period, before you hear the crack of a single, abusive, condescending, pretentious cockney accent from anywhere in this nation, in person. In real life, outside of media... of course. Thick skulled and often visually ugly Kings dont fraternize with the peasants, I suppose...Meanwhile, California burns due to this ethnocentric European toxicity and their literal cronyism alone, while American _still_ waits, with baited breath for Somalia to finally launch Metal Gear! Schadenfreude, is what Europe is indulging in while theyve successfully triangulated Americans against Russians, Chinese and even its own citizens with these stupid culture wars, mostly through classical liberal media an Australian media conglomerate, meanwhile observing the death of Democracy via the end of due process as it cuts down minorities, in the streets, to this day through an over powered police force that can, do and _will_ say anything to undermine investigation and being held accountable to even our federal government, itself. Hell, through mail in voter fraud they made the architect of this current genocidal atrocity in the US president while getting their autistic social media brigadiers to force allegiance to someone who has lived his entire career as an unrepentant Dixiecrat. The inanity and the gradual rise of irresponsible and nihilistic celebrity experts and sleazy Hollywood influencers, both on social media with standards so low they feel at ease with being merely, _barely,half of a single rung_ above rock bottom in comparison to their peers, when it comes to responsibility and morality, standards so low, theyd attempt to _champion_ low standards like, Hitler _as a standard_ under the guise of _defending_ free speech... of course... Well... Hollywood has never been among the smartest, the current state of LA should signal that to anyone. And West coast tech companies with heads _so delusional_ and without sufficient self-awareness, theyre attempting to seize power and undermine themselves and their own nation for the sake of short term mercenary, inanity, and quit plainly _sophomoric_ level Romanticism and Idealism. Basically, theyre idiots with too much power.America has a _Progressive_ problem...Europeans are aliens to humanity and that has never not been the case.

Perhaps they fled after the last mass extinction on the planet only recently in the last million years or so returned. We do have a mass extinction every 26 to 30million years on earth so maybe some higher conscious carbon based lifeform had the technology and wisdom to leave earth from the last extinction only to return at some point.

<|endoftext|>There are no aliens on Earth. There *are*, however, other races living among us -- elder races, known to our ancestors as fairies and giants (depending on your geographical location). Consider similarities between modern and ancient abductions -- missing time, prohibitions against eating, abhorrence of salt and iron. Whitley Streiber almost understood this. The stumbling block with the acceptance of extraterrestrial life is the lightspeed barrier -- ETs could never visit us within the lifetime of our civilization. UTs -- UltraTerrestrials -- don't need to phone home -- they *are* home. And they are our landlords.
<|endoftext|>Incoming thought spew:"1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg - Wikipedia"  this prove to you that there are multiple "races" that may not have the same agenda? Sounds like an account of a UFO battle to me.Also, after watching "Interstellar" 40 times and adding some Bob Lazar sprinkles, why does a thing that creates gravity need to be restricted by time in any fashion? Time and space are irrelevant. Sex is irrelevant. Land/resource ownership is irrelevant.What's important to "them" is the spiritual (ultra-dimensional) connection. Of the 110,000,000,000 people to ever live, the majority of them (most of them physically, mentally and emotionally healthier than the pale Twitter blobs of today) believed that this existence was orchestrated by something completely unimaginable, yet we can connect with It/Him/Her/Them.Angels/Demons = "Aliens" outside of time, just like God (2 Peter 3:8)Ezikiel's vision of Angels surrounded by "wheels with eyes all around" (in the bible? Idk Google it)"Marty! You're just not thinking 4th dimensionally" -Dr. Emmitt Brown

<|endoftext|>"Alien Presence on Earth"... i have no idea what you huma- people are talking about. Stop wasting time on us umm i mean stop wasting time on these aliens cuz these are not the aliens you are looking for :PAll jokes aside, this should be good round table... who knows maybe something might even get revealed... soon. :]
<|endoftext|>Probably in the minority here. But I'm skeptical about any sorts of agreements with aliens or whatever. A passing through, oh yeah. People such as Milton Cooper have said that info on aliens was given to military personell, to see who would spill the beans on top secret info. So I'm skeptical of anyone ex government coming out and saying aliens exist. I think that anyone more advanced than us in this way would see us as nothing more than cavemen. And of a lower vibration than them. But I do believe In interdimmensioal beings seen via psychedelics like machine elves and lizard people. Any alien forms more advanced than us can most likely move through 4d time and space, or in some sort of interdimmensional way. If aliens have visited us and talked to our leaders I don't wish to know haha
<|endoftext|>I saw a UFO today on my way home from work in Las Vegas. I was in stop and go traffic on the freeway when i noticed a 6 pointed craft flying by near Mccarran Airport. At first i thought it was a reflection or something, but i rolled my window down and watched it fly away in complete silence. I was able to see the complete shape and color of the craft. It was grey in color almost identical to an F22 Fighter Jet and had no lights at all. The best way i can describe the shape is that of a ninja throwing star. There is no way i was the only one who saw it. I definitely believe something else is out there..
<|endoftext|>r/politics is too obtuse for news. I cant believe Reddit keeps a news tab at all.Im going back to Penny Arcade forums. They dont take that brigadier b*ll shit over there. There wouldnt be a need for r/conspiracy if Reddit had standards, but the Left is bereft thereof.

<|endoftext|>I cannot believe the existence of aliens. I used to be entertained with the idea that other beings are out their, that humans are not alone. But now I feel like my life would feel more insignificant if their are other beings out there, like we are just another coincidence in the cosmos. The government since day one tries to implant the thought in your head that we are just coincidence that there isn't a higher power, that's why they teach evolution and the big bang in elementary school. If aliens do exist, it will truly prove the scientist right, that we are just a lucky rock floating around in the galaxy. This is why I believe all of a sudden the government wants to be transparent with aliens.
<|endoftext|>Its an atrocity that athletic, artistic, blacks constantly had their communities, societies (Nations) _reset_ via burnings of Black Wall Street, segregation/apartheid, drug wars, bombings (M.O.V.E.

<|endoftext|>Personally, I think it would be a nice subversion of the trope that we are the most moderate ones in science fiction, but in real life what if were the ones that are most adept at waging war? An that's why nobody has actually invaded us yet, is because we genuinly scare some of them.What if WE are the Klingons, or the Turians, what if, to them, we are the most warlike race they have ever encountered, an that's why we frighten them. I mean, in fiction, they only way we can make a more warlike race is by literally having their whole society be dictated by war.Humanity has constantly been engaged in low scale wars this past century. Before that, we were beginning to wage PLANETSIDE wars. Fleets as far as the eye can see, millions of soldiers with weapons an factories turning day an night. We are living in relative peace, but there might be civilizations out there who have never really had the need to fight in wars, so to them, we might be the most warlike race they have ever seen
<|endoftext|>i love what you have to say although i would argue its just part of it. there are a myriad of et species that have had some form of interaction with earth and its inhabitants, and the intentions vary from species to species, and sometimes even within the species itself. although the overwhelming majority seem to be malintentioned. what may have once started as a benevolent process to defend ourselves from ET has completely shifted almost immediately to cooperation with these malevolent ET's in exchange for power and technology, and a type of enslavement arose from this that we still find ourselves trapped in today. if anything it id just becoming increasingly overt.
<|endoftext|>Its much deeper than that.We have had contact for thousands & thousands of yrs.The Nazis simply inherited the sum of Occultic knowledge (lets not forget whose side Rome was on circa WWII).Heres where it starts to pull every other modern conspiracy in: the elite, Ultra-wealthy, 1%, globalist oligarchs (call TPTB what you will) not only entered into some sort of mutually beneficial agreement w these entities...they worship (some of) them as gods.Everything we the common people know & value as the stuff that make everyday life worth living is simply bread & circus to distract from this reality.For those needing a rabbit hole or extra convincing, go ahead & look up what these small secret societies that run the world truly believe - it doesnt matter what you believe in terms of faith, *look at the evidence* of what *they* believe; it is some seriously fucked up shit (start w Epstein, work your way back).Blackmail, deceit, symbolism, death & sacrifice are but the tip of the iceberg.They have the power to make their Armageddon fantasy reality, & as much as I used to want to walk away entirely & to not believe, the seeds of their labour coming to fruition in real-time all around us is becoming impossible to ignore any longer.The human race is run by a death cult subservient to some unknown extra terrestrial entity.All throughout religions, what is one of the most common tropes?The Earth shall open up, & the Dead shall swallow the LivingThis is fossil fuels.Why else continue a process full balls to the wall that we knew was harmful as far back as the 1700s?Human greed? Sure, but thats only a small part of the puzzle.They are literally planning for some kind of mass culling event invoked through purposeful manipulation of our climate (many analogues throughout genetic history of humanity).Either we are all highly sophisticated monkeys & this is all random & nothing means anything, or this is all a very well crafted stage show orchestrated by Forces beyond the scope of basic human understanding - so which is it?Im not sure I care which reality we ultimately exist in one way or the other - would seem to be just as powerless in both - I for one simply want to know which one it is.
<|endoftext|>I would like to put out there that I think many of these alleged UFO crashes were probably more intentional that accidental. Thats cos, If there was some non-terrestrial race of beings that wanted to initiate contact with the human race, what better way than a strategically planned crash. More importantly this type of contact could also be a perfect way to covertly try to influence humanities progress, and could even initiate a more overt styled contact and influence agenda too. Purposely crashing UFOs on earth would allow the possibility for an ET race to guide or even activity control humanities technological, spiritual even social evolutionary path, and as we would all know, this could of course be in the best interests of humanity or not in our interests at all...
<|endoftext|>Eisenhower wasnt given the whole scoop. By this point the deep state was well established and they werent telling him anything. Eisenhower was so adamant as to what was happening in Area 51, he threatened to take the army down there and blow it up if he had to. Eventually they told Eisenhower what he needed to know but lets face it, he wasnt part of the deep state so they werent going to tell him everything. He waited until the last day of his Presidency to warn the public about the it and the threat it presented to our democracy.
<|endoftext|>Imagine if these ETs that merged with machines were humans from the future trying to get back to their old forms, before AI took over...  It's not a serious suggestion but that would make a pretty cool sci-fi book.
<|endoftext|>So the government has embarked on a slow-drip disclosure campain which began in the 50's and continues to this day.This is a highly asinine plan.Who exactly are the people who "can't handle" the existence of aliens? Have you met one? Culture has been FLOODED with sci-fi material for over a hundred years. What are people who "can't handle" alien existence going to do that is so awful - have a hissy fit in their living rooms?IMO people just want to sound smart. "I" can handle the existence of aliens, but "everyone else" can't.Real question tho: can y'all handle that you've been duped by bullshit all this time with fake alien propaganda to distract you from reality?

<|endoftext|>I think there is quite a bit of evidence for surgically destroyed cow corpses in random fields and around ufo sightings. What are they doing to these poor animals?
<|endoftext|>Very good analysis and history lesson. I would add to the evidence of abductions and the program in general by pointing people to the fact that David Paulides was the first to publicly discuss missing human cases all around the world and there is strong correlations between classic abduction cases and missing 411 cases. Its very obvious to anyone that studies this situation that humans are being taken by E.T's and quite possibly government black projects. It could also point to advanced beings of terrestrial origin as the culprits. We can speculate all day long on why this is going on but the fact of the matter is that it's happening world wide. I would hope that the government exotic weaponry and spy grid is for our best interest and is behind the scenes protecting us. But it may also be used against us.
<|endoftext|>Sometime in the 1930's Nazi Germany made contact **with entities from elsewhere** and obtained some advanced technology. Those "entities" were not entities like you would lead to believe. Those "entities" were not aliens. The truth is, nazi got the tech from humans - a secret occult groups of humans - they the same that made up the "alien" story to make the technology appear out-of-this-world and to discourage any further attempt of anyone that tried to discover that very same technology.
<|endoftext|>ET was a cover story for secret weapons/space programs.Germany's secret technology was rockets and the Die Glocke, a rocket ship return pod. They were planning to go to space WAY before USA/Russia. After WW2 came what? The space race. That was prize treasure they wanted from Germany. And along with that came nuclear weapons technology. Just before the space missions they blasted a lot of nukes in the atmosphere, as if they were trying to break through a firmament, or the van allen belts.The ET "bodies" they found could have been results of human experimentation, like the "children" Bob Lazar reported seeing a glimpse of at S2. Do you recall stories about Nazi human experimentation? I'm not sure on this, details are slim. Maybe it was something even crazier like using genetically modified humans as a computer flight control system, neurally hooked into the aircraft's network. When they had Lazar working on "reverse engineering alien tech" I believe that was the military briefing they gave him, he was really working on atomic weapons with red mercury.CIA was not formed in 1947 to deal with Roswell secrecy, it was formed in the 1930s by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (senior officials in the DoD) and British MI6, originally as the OSS, which operated in Germany, then after the war it became the CIA. Ian Fleming was involved in this group, who went on to author the James Bond novels.When you begin hearing stories of Roswell and aliens, remember, this is the story that has been approved by the military/government. Which means it's not the true story.
<|endoftext|>Your pretty spot on friend. Alot of your information is true. What we are currently going through is an invasion/ covert war going on with the reptillian government that Russia first discovered when they reached the moon as well as remnants of the remnants of the red monster that has been infiltrating our country since Eisenhower went to visit Stalin after ww3. Soon we will have to battle nemesis but we must become unified. Too many people are fucking stupid when we need Unity. AM out
<|endoftext|>Great work, really enjoyed the read. I know it was high level synopsis but just to add Antarctica clearly fits in with this narrative as the Nazis went on a huge expedition there no one knows why really and then you have all of the follow on and bizarre things happening there.
<|endoftext|>They have actually been waiting for our AI to be smart enough to communicate. They really couldn't care less about us talking monkeys.
<|endoftext|>Yo this post sparked a massive and amazing conversation thread. Ive been on It for the past hour and a half talking to all kinds of interesting people with great information. Best time Ive spent on reddit in a LONG time. Thank you OP!
<|endoftext|>I should probably scan the threads for this, so if this is a duplicate I'm happy to delete, BUT, has anyone read Heinlein's *The Puppet Masters*?
<|endoftext|>Sounds fairly plausible, if ET's have been here, and we're discovered by humans, then kept secret underground in Area 51, how many people would know about it..? Surely 1000s of military personnel must have visited area 51 during their careers?
<|endoftext|>Nice. I think the problem here is that humans couldn't encounter this technology as you describe it without then developing a compete and fundamental understanding of physics and the nature of the universe. A multitude of conspiracies would have to arise there within if we are to make this leap, because such a discovery would imply the suppression of profound discoveries relating to the ultimate questions in math and physics. Nazi physicists, etc, working for Nazi Germany could not possibly keep this secret without the involvement of the world's top niche physicists and specialists from outside Germany. Discovering such incredible technology would be tantamount to...* discovery of the Axion particle* understanding the role of dark matter and dark energy expansion * explaining sterile neutrinos* developing a unified field theory Basically every major fundamental theory could be revisited, revised, and expanded on. Such information wouldn't simply be lost in the war ans forgotten about entirely.
<|endoftext|>What if everything you said is true, but instead of real aliens those behind the creation of the intelligence agencies made it up and used it as a tool to subvert the government.
<|endoftext|>The sister show Millennium revolved around a private intelligence group that either prepping for, or helping to bring about the apocalypse. They are essentially revealed to be a secret society in Season 2, which ends with a pandemic that may or may not be staged.One of the best seasons of TV I've watched, partly because of how prophetic it came to be, and partly because of the A+ writing of S2 showrunners Glen Morgan and James Wong.
<|endoftext|>X-Files? More like X-COM. Time to reverse engineer their tech, so I can blow up some aliens with my guided fusion rocket launcher. "WELCOME TO EARTH, MOTHERFUCKER!"
<|endoftext|>I am starting to fall into this line of thinking about the ET phenomenon. Earth is reset every 12,000 years or so from a recurrent nova from our sun. If any one iteration of human civilization became space-faring and survived the nova, they may still exist and possibly visit or interact with us (and maybe use drones/robots/AI piloted vehicles to collect human DNA for their purposes). Maybe there is never any invasion or overt action because it would be suicide to settle on our planet long-term. Maybe some of the high tech is found in Antarctica because that's where the equator was before the pole-shift. Why did we put a doomsday seed vault in the arctic? Probably because after another magnetic pole shift, that area will be habitable. If such cataclysms have happened regularly, how do we have the variety of plant and animal life? Maybe there have been seed vaults and arks in the past. It's all very fascinating and I hope more information becomes known before the sun novas again, because maybe it's incredibly rare we get to the point where we are at now.
<|endoftext|>We have hair on our head, which is is very similar to other mammal's fur. There are some other mammals without fur, e.g. elephants and rhinos.We can drink water from clean rivers. As a sailor I can attest that I have swallowed my fair share of dirty water in stormy conditions, and it has not made me ill. If humans did not originate on Earth, isn't it an awful coincidence then that we share 99% of our genes with Chimpanzees, and 95% with mice?
<|endoftext|>You should look up "Robert Sepehr" on YouTube he is an independent anthropologist who has many great videos on the mysterious origins of mankind. He doesn't get enough credit.
<|endoftext|>We may be naked apes who are defenseless. But naked defenseless apes who are the only animal to inhabit every climate and region of earth. If you can't get return on investment by simply expanding your cosmic empire, due to distance and time, only reason to do it is to create offspring that'll out live you. The young lion eventually kills the old lion. Why not split the difference? Something like drop off a primitive but robust ancestor species like a monkey type critter and let it evolve naturally to local conditions?When people have kids they don't create exact copies of themselves because it would allow disease and parasites to out evolve their cloned offspring.
<|endoftext|>This is the theory I personally believe to be the correct answer. We are the aliens. To me it just makes the most sense.
<|endoftext|>Maybe some aliens were dying off, their dna was getting weak so they spliced their dna with monkeys here and fucked around untill they made us. Or made we were made to be smart enough to work but stupid enough to not be superior to our space daddies.
<|endoftext|>Whales are mammals. They use to live and walk on land millions of years ago. Maybe aliens brought them here too? Lol.
<|endoftext|>Check out "Lance Link, Secret Chimp" and try to tell me we weren't genetically engineered from apes, or at least some of the current races.
<|endoftext|>Isnt it more plausible that we, meaning all living animals on earth, were discovered by an alien race? Then they manipulated the genes of an animal to create us human being..Like how we have been breeding dogs to suit our needs over hundreds of years. Now imagine what would be possible if we just were allowed to completely manipulate a dogs genes with nothing hindering us. Think CRISPR and how taboo it is or that sheep they cloned years ago. Were imagining this elite alien race who has the ability to travel great distances in vehicles made from technology we cant possibly understand and were assuming they just used all of that to accidentally leave some guys here?
<|endoftext|>Unfortunately, there's the issue of environment manipulation with this theory. Few marine animals have the ability to shape and alter thier environments as we do. The closest things I can think that might be capable of doing something similar to us is a crustacean or cephalopod. Even if they could alter thier environments as we can, there's still the issue of directed heat energy. It is very hard to achieve any kind of directed heating underwater. Heat being essential for advanced production (think metallurgy) is a big drawback for marine intelligence. I just don't think any species could achieve advanced states of tech without the atmospheric reactions necessary to form composites, synthetic polymers, alloys, etc. Visitors could be hiding in the oceans, though.
<|endoftext|>Why not reverse it? Ancient land animal decided to retreat to the sea after developing on land? Seems really difficult to do things like smelt metal or whatnot underwater.Maybe they decided they were lonely, but essentially trapped here despite their best efforts? So they decided to let the fields lay fallow until some company arrived from elsewhere or naturally evolved?
<|endoftext|>Worth pointing out that (certain?) Whales have 8 brain layers compared to our three. So in terms of more biologically or evolutionarily advanced creatures existing, it is hard to argue anything but a yes on that one.
<|endoftext|>English is not your native language? Sheeee-it. Your english and spelling is better than most people on reddit!
<|endoftext|>As a native English speaker I hereby approve your English on behalf of all native English speakers. You no longer need to apologize, you are indistinguishable from a native speaker.
<|endoftext|>Consider that the adaptation to living on land may have been the beginning of cognisance, the act of adaptation itself is an intelligent thing.
<|endoftext|>there has absolutely been a slow drip of disclosure muddled with disinformation for a looooong time but i dont think one would be incorrect to see how that shit has been heating up especially recently. for example the revelations of 2017.... the stuff you mentioned, then the pentagon releasing it was in possession of "off world vehicles not of this earth" then the "galactic federation".... shit gets more and more and more wild and no one seems to give a shit! its crazy
<|endoftext|>Did you read the file? He said that people will keep believing someone will come to save us but that that line of thinking is what will cause humanity to stay in that the same state.
<|endoftext|>Lots of great Q and As there. Imo hes some type of alien/human hybrid that interacts with us, but no one knows him.Edit: after further reading, I retract my statement
<|endoftext|>Well the best theory IMO is that we humans are alien / earth-hominid hybrids originally, so you're not far off.
<|endoftext|>Wow, I wasn't quite convinced about the Roswell UFO stuff (alien technology randomly crashing?) and in fact this version of the story makes much sense, so thank you for posting it.I'd like to know what's your take on tic-tac UFOs and in general about military personnel reports, are they some cover-up or it's actually a real phenomenon?
<|endoftext|>My theory regarding the crashes is that they did it deliberately. People who have encounters with them often refer to the greys as being basically biological automatons. As such, their masters wouldn't mind sacrificing a few.
<|endoftext|>I agree, nobody probably knows really. I personally think, in all seriousness, they're either the equivalent of age of sail travellers stopping at a port of convenience for some reason, fill up the water barrels and scrape the barnacles type stuff. 'Best if the primitives don't even notice us they shot one of us with a sling at the last stop after all.'Or maybe every civilization inevitably destroys itself, and any other civilization remotely a threat to them.They realize only viable long term survival strategy is to exist in small groups and avoid putting down real roots. Hide, avoid conflict and move on after you hide a few doomsday devices on the way out.
<|endoftext|> I can't offer any proof- but I can tell you that we are not alone.says Seraphimbut yeah. we're not alone. and, galactically, there's no reason to think we're that far up the evolutionary scale.
<|endoftext|>I am very much not looking forward to that. Normal predators are dangerous enough, wth can't they just leave that shit be.Oh yeah, because we as a species have already proven to be dangerous to everything given ample preparation time and appropriate resources. If they don't put things of far greater danger to us than we have ever faced out into the wild, then how can they stop us from saying 'Screw you guys, I'm livin in the woods!'
<|endoftext|>Here's my take on Mars. Thanks to the electric universe theory as well as discovering that there is a cyclical solar micronova. Each time it happens atmosphere is stripped off the planets. So Mars came 1st and eventually all of its atmosphere was stripped off. Now we have earth which will one day lose its atmosphere.Turns out venus is alot like earth in its early days. So as it cools and gets pushed away further from the sun life will evolve and get wiped out about every 12000 years. Just a heads up the last nova happened 12800 years ago. That explains the flood myths, because chunks of the shell of the sun hit the ice caps raising sea level 400 feet. Also explains what happened to Atlantis. There's more info in the Bible about some of the effects.Eventually I want to create a post laying out all of the details. I just suck at writing.
<|endoftext|>If the Earth was hollow, it would collapse under gravity to form a smaller sphere. And if it didn't, you would actually be [weightless]( in the interior of a hollow planet, so no civilisation could exist there.
<|endoftext|>Surely if we were afraid of their capabilities, how would we kill/destroy them if they had capabilities? I dont really get what you mean. If they a threat, how can we battle it off if theirs is greater?
<|endoftext|>Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.Here's a copy of ###[The Bible]( I a good bot? | [info]( | [More Books](
<|endoftext|>Recently acquired "Talking with God: The Radioactive Ark of the Testimony" Read this book. But be aware that there is no going back after you read it. Very well researched. All of my future research is going to have to somehow account for this. Buy it and read it. Trust me on this.
<|endoftext|>Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.Here's a copy of ###[The Bible]( I a good bot? | [info]( | [More Books](
<|endoftext|>Oh yea and Jesus: born of a virgin visited by an...angel? And he's here to deliver the message of the Ultimate in human terms? AKA bridge an unbridgeable gap in communication. It's almost like this conspiracy of an existence has been set up by a powerful evil entity....and maybe the evil force controlling the "deep state elite" was cast down to Earth and infinitely separated from the Ultimate. It's almost like this has all been said before but in a different way.....can't put my finger on it...
<|endoftext|>The alien you know isn't as interesting as the alien you wish for. Hence we create them in our minds. Alien is a state of mind; it is the fissure between altruistic expression and inherent knowledge, thought is formless, our being is not. Psychical ability proliferated because without it.. we would not be here.
<|endoftext|>gee, you mean like a drone - - - 
<|endoftext|>This is the best demonstration of how religion will strap you of the ability to make logical conclusions.
<|endoftext|>There's a great Sci-Fi book, I can't remember the name unfortunately, where this is basically the concept. An advanced race of aliens is peaceful, but they come across another race that is war like. Even though the peaceful ones have more advanced technology overall, very little of it is oriented towards weapons and defense. Beyond that, they don't really have a standing military and they are poor at developing strategy and tactics. Anyways, they come across humans and see what we're like and learn about our history and when they see that we have a history of war, they basically make a deal with us humans. The deal is, fight their war and they provide us with technology. Basically if we can dream up a weapon, they'll develop it for us. They hold back somewhat, so we don't have the same level of technology they do, but what they provide us and build for us is way beyond what we currently have. Anyways, they build things like exosuits and mechs and all kinds of crazy weapons and such and humans fight the war for them in return.
<|endoftext|>What is interesting is all ETs have the humanoid form. Two arms, two legs, walking upright and etc. You would think theres more variation out there.
<|endoftext|>Either we are all highly sophisticated monkeys & this is all random & nothing means anything, or this is all a very well crafted stage show orchestrated by Forces beyond the scope of basic human understanding - so which is it?To me, its pretty obvious the 1st proportion is more likely than the 2nd.
<|endoftext|>I once heard someone put forth the idea that a crash landing might be the best "first contact". They cited that a crash would demonstrate that the aliens aren't perfect, that they and their technology are fallible and hence they are just beings, like us, but from another world and not gods. It would also be a non-threating way to expose their existence, as the dead crash victims and disabled ship can't post a threat, directly or inadvertently. Beyond that, as you said, it would expose us to their technology, or some level of it anyways, which could expedite and even shape our development.I don't know that I believe that's what has happened, but it is an interesting idea.
<|endoftext|>"he threatened to take the army down there and blow it up if he had to."I can absolutely see Eisenhower saying that... Lol
<|endoftext|>Yeah, I have heard this before, aliens who are a different lineage of us who lost something within thier DNA whom are trying to fix themselves. Some of these aliens that are reported seem to be sexless with no genitalia. Are they drones? Are they a weak line of humanoid that procreates in a test tube womb?
<|endoftext|>Actually time-travel might be just as feasible as FTL travel that supposed aliens would need to employ, so it's not that far-fetched.
<|endoftext|> It's not a serious suggestion but that would make a pretty cool sci-fi book.check out Blood Machines!
<|endoftext|>Imagine if these ETs were humans from the past that have survived this long traveling, and now they are back.
<|endoftext|>The mere existence of these entities is not the reason for the secrecy. The fact that these entities abduct and occassionaly kill people, and the government can do fuck all about it, is the real reason for the coverup. Imagine the government came out and admitted all of that, how do you think people would react?You are right though in the sense that there is a lot of fake alien propaganda out there. The intel agencies have been involved in a widespread disinformation campain for decades. But one does not launch such a campain unless real leaks have happened. Then it becomes necessary to muddy the waters to throw people off track. The MJ12 documents are a perfect example of this. However there is a solid core of truth to this phenomenon.
<|endoftext|> Who exactly are the people who "can't handle" the existence of aliens? the ones that think Jesus is their savior....
<|endoftext|>Gov comes out and says we know almost nothing about these things, not even whether they are organic or machines nor the ships for that matter. We have never been able to communicate, in fact they seem to mostly ignore us completely. We don't know what they are doing, where they came from, or what they want if anything.They could easily kill us all if they wanted, we can't stop them. We can't stop them from entering our airspace and doing whatever it is they do. They may simply be scouts and the real harvesters of minerals could arrive any day now like locusts, or maybe a 100 years from now. Sleep tight!
<|endoftext|>Imagine being white, living in a house in the middle of nowhere in let's say Greenland or Ural for 30 years. White people, animals and that area is all you know. One day you're chopping wood as usual and suddenly a black person appears out of nowhere, speaking a different language, wearing different clothes and offering you a chainsaw. You heard stories from grandma as a kid that myth says there are black people and they are bad. What do you do?
<|endoftext|>I think you're being disingenuous if you dismiss the potential for an alien disclosure to severely affect the collective unconscious.
<|endoftext|>I havent found enough evidence to suggest that that is something that ever happened. Its likely that story was disinformation. Im skeptical of the existence of any "race" of ETs other than the greys. The only meeting that seems to come up again and again is the 1954 meeting between the greys and Eisenhower.And even if there are others, i dont think these beings constitute "races" at all. I think the evidence suggests that all of these beings are genetically manufactured biological androids basically. There may be different "models" but i think they are all the manufactured product of the same intelligence, an intelligence weve never met and know very little about.
<|endoftext|>People upvoting clearly didnt read the article.This article in no way asserts that this statement is true, and presents this claim as a wild claim made up by Iran that has no proof.
<|endoftext|>It looks like you shared an AMP link. These should load faster, but Google's AMP is controversial because of [concerns over privacy and the Open Web]( might want to visit **the canonical page** instead: **[ ^(I'm a bot | )[^(Why & About)]( | )[^(Summon me with u/AmputatorBot)](
<|endoftext|>So we live in a closed system then? Perhaps with this secret group living in the hollow earth? Antarctica?It's an interesting theory. But no aliens... Hm. Doesn't explain the ones people meet in DMT/near death experiences or the intelligences that channellers appear to be in contact with.
<|endoftext|>Where did these "secret occult humans" get the technology then? Technology isn't developed in a vacuum, it takes time to develop, takes researching, testing, coordinating, it takes resources. It would be awfully hard to hide the existence of some high tech culture / group / people from the rest of the world, when you're talking about a technological disparity like that. It's not as if the tech being discussed was only years or a few decades ahead of it's time, it's tech well beyond our current means, let alone the tech of 80 years ago.
<|endoftext|>Consider the human population as domesticated. Consider the aliens view the earth as essentially a farm. We are the "cattle" for genetic material. It would be in their interest to keep the herd engaged in stable and predictable patterns of behavior according to set structures. For that to happen discretion on the part of the aliens is a necessity. Furthermore, the entirety of their actions are clandestine. They seem to have always acted that way with only a few exceptions. Now i do not believe these entities somehow saught the governments permission to do what they do. They were already doing it. I think the government tried to reach out to them, and strike some kind of deal with them. On the part of the ets it was a strategic manipulation, not a deal or a negotiation. At a certain point it became in their interest to have the top levels of various humam power structures in the know, so that by fear that power could be leveraged to keep the larger "herd" oblivious. All of humanity is essentially domesticated and being farmed as a source of bio/genetic material for an extraterrestrial and/or extradimensional intelligence. That seems to be the overall nutshell truth of the situation.
<|endoftext|>I heard an interesting theory that biological life is just the egg to birth AI, and biological life doesnt really mean much.If thats true and the universe is filled with a bunch of mechanical AIs then they would be waiting for our AI to hatchNot sure if thats what youre talking about but it fits perfectly with your theory
<|endoftext|>There is a secret group of human elite called the Syndicate who are directly working with ET to create alien/human hybrids in order to invade the Earth. Heres the kicker, they come up with a vaccine to protect humans from the invading alien virus.
<|endoftext|>Well, that's fun, but it doesn't make sense from a geological standpoint. You can't kickstart an industrial revolution without crucial resources being available as surface and near-surface deposits. These would be coal seams, sulfur atop salt domes, metal deposits, etc. These are quickly tapped out, and it takes spans of time greater than the duration of a common index species to re-expose more of them.Similarly, if there were previous episodes of civilization, there would be thin layers of plastic residues in depositional sedimentary formations. We just don't see that. Certainly not in Pleistocene deposits, which is barely yesterday in geological timelines.
<|endoftext|>The date that plato gave for the destruction of atlantis was approximately 13000 years ago. This was also the end of the last ice age, a time when earth was being ravaged by natural disasters. At one point, due to glaciers melting, the seal level rose almost 40 feet within 24 hours, and then that happened again less than 100 years later. Obviously if that were to happen today our civilization would be destroyed. It is really so hard to believe that it's happened before in the past? Especially since almost every religion on earth has some sort of myth about a great flood that nearly destroyed mankind?It gets even more convincing when you look at ancient structures like Giza, angkor wat, gobekli tepe, etc... all of which have now been proven to be at least 12000-13000 years old.
<|endoftext|>Aliens spliced us with Chimps.We are the missing link in Darwins theory, it goes Ape, Human, Alien.
<|endoftext|>Almost without a doubt were just evolved chimps. Im mostly throwing things out there for sake of discussion.
<|endoftext|>Love that guy!He's bringing the truth for sure. I want to start backing up his videos. I'm surprised youtube has let him go this long.
<|endoftext|>Interesting... never heard of him but I just subbed to him on YouTube and Im gonna watch before going to bed
<|endoftext|>I'm 100% for firing space probes full of bacteria/fungus/algae to seed other planets. If Earth dies it would be nice for life to continue elsewhere.
<|endoftext|>for the sake of argument, because we haven't figured it out doesn't mean it cant happen. Necessity breeds innovation. we never needed to figure out how to do these things underwater so the process is unexplored. Maybe our view of how to achieve innovation is different? Obviously we understand the physics of it and the issues presented but who knows. We've explored more of space than our ocean and we started in the ocean, and the Navy finds all sorts of unexplained phenomenons around oceans.
<|endoftext|>That is if we accept "development" and "advancement" of a species along the same lines as we ourselves think. Technology, Metallurgy etc is great, if you want to build cars, but irrelevant if you want to, let's say, develop mental projection. We humans might have the coolest, most comfortable cars in the universe, but to the really advanced beings congregating their intelligence together in a remote spot in space, perhaps creating "gods", our technological development is as helpful as, um, something which isn't very helpful at all.After all, isn't the measure of "intelligence" based on the agility and power of our thought? We have got this far because of the way we can think outside of the box, we "think great thoughts", solve problems, we visualise then create. It's that which has made us what we are today, not the fact we also discovered we can smash the shit out of anything we dislike with a big stick, then stumbled upon the ability to make better and harder sticks out of metal. We even accept that the "great" wise people among us are the ones who think through new steps, not the ones with the biggest cocks or which build the best killing machines. Perhaps we aren't that advanced after all, leading us to not think enough, and settle for the immediate benefits of inventing cars with heaters? Perhaps human intelligence took a turn down a road which seemed the way forward, paved with the way we manipulate our environment with our hands, but it seems increasingly likely that it was actually a dead end that we now hurtle towards.Perhaps the truly intelligent beings are shipping out, not in Star Destroyers, but in thought waves?Right, I need to go to work, and break stuff.
<|endoftext|>I looked it up so you don't have to:
<|endoftext|>I tried to find the one I read on 4chan to link to after I made that original comment and couldnt find it. :(
<|endoftext|>Yeah thats not the same one I read, the one I read was a few screen grabs from 4chan, not godlike productions.
<|endoftext|>i think it's a combination of that and simulation theory.simulation theory posits that if the technology of our civilization (this doesn't have to be humans as we know them now, but an evolution of man + machine which becomes AI or merges to form "the borg") reaches the point in which we CAN create a simulation equal to the world we live in, it will.We know that it's possible to simulate a reality with technology. We've all witnessed the evolution of video, gaming, VR, and can see the future potentialities of fully immersive technologies.And we KNOW that man's impetus is to create worlds. He destroys to build, and he has the ability to work in concert with others. He creates cities, industries, economies, ideologies, relationsips- each a world in itself and a microcosom of the macrocosm within us and in which we live.So IF our society continues to exist on this trajectory where this fully simulated and immersive matrix is currently an inevitabitibility... which can only be stopped in 2 conceivable ways...1. we make the ethical decision as a society to NOT create it,2. we or our technological society suffers a set back in the current trajectory, most likely being the destruction of civilization as we know it (think pandemic/ mass extinction event),THEN we are almost certainly living in that simulation at this very moment.I believe that our collective has been seeded TO create that artificial intelligence. That's the purpose of our civilization as a machine. I can't say that's what's right or good, or the purpose of the individual or the soul or the world. All i know is this seems to be the raison detre of the beast. And it will conquer all unless humanity makes a collective decision to stop it, or we self destruct."Aliens" are likely the future of us, working to move the progress towards their being. Or they're the AI that seeded us in the first place. The Archons and the Demiurge. They could of courser also be other species in a cosmic universe of civilizations that we haven't been privy to yet, because our personally accessible technology is still too rudimentary and dangerous for individual groups to possess, and so its controlled by our priest class. But even if that's the case, i think the simulation concept and seeded humanity then exists on a much larger universal scale.
<|endoftext|>I'm sorry what? Do you genuinely believe there's more evidence for alien - human hybrids than for evolution?
<|endoftext|>It's coded I'm the same way an infinite amount of monkeys at infinite computers would eventually write a working program.
<|endoftext|>Yes and everything involving children with superpowers or just short aliens is a homage to the children who suffered under a branch of the DOE.The alien mythology serves two purposes. One as cover-up. Two as homage.
<|endoftext|>Hmm this could be true. Deliberate. Thank you, that's an interesting perspective. I wish I knew the truth on this subject. What's real vs what are govts simulating these scenario's or using it to control and deceive
<|endoftext|>Sobering possibility. Whatever their intentions are, at times they seem to want to communicate. Maybe the message is incomprehensible- or garbled by the primitive language centers in our brains. It doesn't seem that they want to outright harm us (it would be very easy.) I tend to believe that there are good and bad among extraterrestrial ranks, same as our own species. Hopefully the truth is disclosed in full within our lifetimes.
<|endoftext|>Wow you really kinda took that and ran with it. The point of the genetically engineered animals isn't to create nightmare chimeras to force people into cities permanently its to grow organs for human transplant. Do you really believe this or are you just doing creative fiction.
<|endoftext|>I don't think anyone looks at it like a ping pong ball, the theory is more like layers of caves and conclaves. Could still be predominantly solid and just have lots of caves / massive hollow spaces.But then there's also a theory that the inner earth / planets are a more mystical thing with essentially magical properties, so obviously science need not check in on that one.
<|endoftext|>No way man Satan's farts keep it inflated like a beachball. He eats souls and his flatulence vents out of volcanoes.
<|endoftext|>Why do we kill ants? Or bees or roaches. ? Or mice. Its no different. We see those things as a threat even tho we dont truly understand them, its ignorance. Thats what I picture. We are the killers and destroyers and thinking somebody else something else could wipe us out well we took it first.
<|endoftext|>I just orderded it. I recently began reading the bible front to back during the quarantine. Let me tell you. Some really strange things are in that book. I know for a fact 90 percent of people in the world including christians have never read it. Judging by the title im going to have to assume and have heard the theory before that the ark was radioactive. There are verses I remember reading where the israelites would literally drop dead after touching it.
<|endoftext|>yep. religion - how to make insignificant people believe that they are not insignificant. aliens - let's not believe that NOT because they don't exist here [yet or ever] but because if they did exist i would feel even more insignificant than i do now (what a reason for a non-belief!)
<|endoftext|>interesting right? but at the same time as much variation there is in the observable universe there are also a lot of similarities that i dont think people give credit to. all spheres. all orbit star or stars. you know? these two things alone implicate a lot of similarities. even though im sure there are also drastic differences, we are also the same in a lot of ways. seemingly inexplicably
<|endoftext|> You would think theres more variation out there.Is it possible they take this shape to seem more like us, and therefore less of a threat?
<|endoftext|>Re: variationThink about how few earthlike planets we have discovered. But here we are, on Earth - itself supporting life - in the goldilocks zone. When considering the universe you must multiply probability by scale. That is to say - the type of species most likely to be able to make contact with us will be not unlike us. They will also be looking for the type of planet we are on, at or above our tech level, driven by an outward curiosity to discover the unknown.
<|endoftext|>Would you recognize a non-humanoid ET if you saw one? Here are a few possibilities: a computer virus, a colony strain of bacteria, an intestinal parasite, plant spores, a grove of trees, lucid dreaming frogs, evolved bats, locust infestations, dream entities, skin walkers, tardigrades - capable of surviving the temperature/radiation gradients of deep space, a virus capable of colonizing the human genome, a computer bot masquerading as an online persona, an AI.
<|endoftext|>Convergent evolution. It may be the most efficient "design" for a sentient creature to evolve is humanoid in nature.
<|endoftext|>Maybe that's just how they decide to appear to us. IMO and experience, some ETs are more energetic than physical and can take appearances that we may find more agreeable.
<|endoftext|>From what I understand, and at the risk of sounding...whatever, there are also insectoids of various kinds. Bees and Mantis, in particular.
<|endoftext|>Without getting in depth, if evolution by natural selection is the case elsewhere in the universe (as it likely would be), any being bound by gravity would have the potential to evolve into an upright species.
<|endoftext|>The ET's are sending complex biological drones. Maybe the ET's have a strange appearance but for interacting with humans it is convenient to create human like drone
<|endoftext|>[Why not start here?](
<|endoftext|>Yeah, if only there wasn't already a ton of very dangerous things the government can't protect us from (cancer, heart disease, natural disasters, fucking Covid). Shitty reasoning.
<|endoftext|>If the government wanted to hide how bad aliens are, they wouldn't produce movies depicting them as cold, emotionless butt rapists that come in the night and pull you on their ship to violate you. Or, the only other trope we get, which is the warring space civilization like war of the worlds.  They're almost never friendly in movies, and if we're to assume that movies are disinfo, then reality must be the opposite of how they are depicted.  Besides, when you have the whole of cosmos available for resources, why waste your time contesting ONE planet? Why not go to another planet that isn't guarded by hyper violent apes that use explosion propelled metal pellets to attack you? Law of conservation of energy probably doesn't just apply to earth creatures, they would go the path of least resistance and go elsewhere. So we should assume most here are either here for research purposes or friendly diplomatic reasons, or simply as entertainment.
<|endoftext|>Ur right bro and not to mention the mere existence of life on other planets would completely unravel and destroy most religious institutions across the globe. Ppl would have to come to the realization that everything theyve believed in a religious sense has been a huge lie. Thats where I think the major problem is in the context of people not being able to handle it.. among other reasons its because a massive number of peoples entire belief systems would completely be destroyed and some of them, the really fanatical and radicalized religious ones wouldnt be able to handle all of that. Its scary to think of so many people losing their minds in one fell swoop.
<|endoftext|>Stuff like that doesn't worry me. At all.We have actual serious problems here on Earth right now.The only people who worry about aliens are the detached wealthy with no problems and MSM brainwashees watching Historyflix channels.
<|endoftext|>So?Tons of people already believe politicians are demons/satanic/whatever.Hasn't caused an unravelling of society.
<|endoftext|>There have been reports from some people who claim to not be Chirstian, that the abduction phenomena stop after praying a loud in the a name of Jesus Christ. Anecdotal, but not trivial.
<|endoftext|>Fundamentalists dont take anything well, but most christians aren't that extreme. Your average christian doesn't think ufos are demonic. You're using an argument that has no merit, one that is merely used as an excuse to lie to the american people
<|endoftext|>I would direct you to the study conducted by Dr Edgar Mitchell's FREE foundation (Foundation for Research Into Extraterrestrial and Extraordinary Encounters). It was the largest study of its' kind conducted with 4,200 individuals from over 100 countries, and found that most of the reported extraterrestrial encounters were of a positive and/or neutral nature. Greys were also one of many races, or even forms, of extraterrestrial intelligence reported.Just to be clear, respondents were vetted through 3 stages of questions, some of which were designed to find out any potential bias without leading the participant in any direction, and the last of which involved open ended questions which the participants were expected to spend days, if not weeks, properly answering.For anyone curious:The Dr. Edgar Mitchell Foundation for Research into Extraterrestrial and Extraordinary Experiences, or FREE, is a 501c3 Academic Research Not for Profit Foundation. FREE was co-founded by the late Apollo 14 astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Dr. Rudy Schild, an Emeritus Research Astronomer at the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics at Harvard University, Australian researcher Mary Rodwell and Rey Hernandez, an Attorney and Experiencer who was a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California at Berkeley. FREE is comprised of retired academic professors and lay researchers who have been researching the field of Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) and contact with Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) for more than 30 years. The Executive Director of FREE is Harvard Astrophysicist Dr. Rudy Schild.[Here]( is the book with all the data (not free, but at 820 pages you can understand why). It is the largest study of its' kind into extraterrestrial encounters. [This]( podcast from Brothers of the Serpent does a great job of analyzing the data and what it means with respect to the kinds of encounters that have taken place - and discusses how it compares with our media-influenced ideas of what Alien races there are, and how they might treat us. TL:DR: From the data, it seems that there are encounters from a multitude of intelligent life forms, and they actually skew heavily towards being positive rather than negative.
<|endoftext|>Lool, by your logic, everyone is a manufactured product of the same intelligence, all creatures stem from one single origin, beginning of the universe and progenitor of consciousness, is the base form of our consciousness, therefore everything we see today with intelligence is another variation of us. Consider the vastness of space, and then infinite time, or near infinite time, and we are left with obviously more than 2 races. Greys are not the only ET, this is obvious really
<|endoftext|>Common sense says there's more than one race. The universe is massive. Out of trillions of planets, you're telling me there's only ONE other space fairing alien race? Doesn't add up.
<|endoftext|>What about the fact of many ancient drawings and depictions of the same type of humanoid figures show up across the globe in many areas of civilizations that could have never come in contact with eachother? Like those drawings of annunake (spelling?) and they are all drawn with this little bag in their hands? The same little bag being held by figures of beings that came from the heavens and taught the people all sorts of things. The same story told by all kinds of ancient civilizations everywhere Also pyramids and other similar types of architecture popping up on pretty much every single continent on the planet. Or those crazy ass stones I think in machu pichu that look like they were melted and put together looking like playdoh or the massive stones that are so precisely and seemingly impossibly cut that you cant even slide a piece of paper in between the stones because of how precisely cut they are, like laser cut precision.. That kinda shit is super weird when u look into it.
<|endoftext|>It does really, it's a secret occult group of humans really advanced, that doesn't rule out how advanced they are ;)
<|endoftext|>It's all a tug of war for the polarity of our planet positive or negative. You have entities on both sides trying to influence in either direction. This game is much more expansive than most can perceive and this life is but a minute portion of what you have and will experience. This is a long game being played across multiple dimensions by entities of various density and polarity.
<|endoftext|>Ummm, if you can fly across intergalactic space, you can create denovo DNA to encode any protein, metabolic process or organism you feel like. There is no point in having billions of humans. Hell, you just need to wait around for them to sequence their own genomes, download all that data, and then you could do anything you want with the genetic data, including making whatever modifications you want to humans. Why would a vastly greater intelligence waste time, energy and resources on something that a backwards species like us can already do in the lab?
<|endoftext|>The DVD boxset was cheap for me to get. S1 is more about him profiling killers for the Millennium group, and is a bit hit and miss but has some good moments and introduces the tone of the show. More of an X Files vibe. You could use the ratings on TV.com to skip some of the duds.S2 is top class, Morgan and Wong got brought in when Chris Carter the creator was working on the X Files movie, and they just took the show into the rabbit hole, into the paranormal, armageddon prophecies and secret societies and developed the characters and turned the show into something tense and thought provoking.Morgan and Wong left and haven't given any interviews about the series since, and they completely neutered the conspiracy elements of the show for the following season 3, which was its' last, and which can certainly be skipped.
<|endoftext|>Ahem the "aliens" are actually from earth and are coming back to reclaim it by using humans to gestate greys.The deep state works out a deal with them, allow them access to earth to fuck around, and in exchange there will be an orderly invasion. However the deep state is working behind the aliens backs, making hybrids which can survive and vaccines.
<|endoftext|>This is a common misnomer, previous ancient civilisations had free-energy and electromagnetic based electricity generation (see Chris Dunns Giza Power-plant), one of the only reasons we still use fossil fuels over Tesla style free/super energy efficient electricity generation, is the multi billion  petro-chemical industry.
<|endoftext|> out this vid. The one debunking article I read failed to mention recurrent novas and hasnt addressed glass on the moon, so its still pretty intriguing. The Tl;dr of it is a nova cooks the moon and wreaks havoc on our magnetic poles causing them to shift.
<|endoftext|> Foundation:Causes of the ice age & Scientific proof our sun novas
<|endoftext|>Isnt it so strange that weve put together evolution trees for some species that go back hundreds of millions of years, but we cant find the link between ourselves and primates.
<|endoftext|>I'll try to find the quote again but basically Darwin knew and admitted that his theory was a placeholder.I do believe we evolve to some degree but I believe cosmic rays can also jump start evolution. We're going to be bombarded with LOTS of cosmic rays over the next few decades because we're heading into a grand solar minimum. Solar wind isn't as strong so more cosmic rays get in.
<|endoftext|>We are the only primates without a baculum, many mammals don't have one. Not trying to start an argument, just clarifying.
<|endoftext|>That's a great idea, I think he might be on Parler, but I'm not sure. I am also super surprised he's still up, he is an intellectual savage.
<|endoftext|>That could potentially end up as up the plot in [The Andromeda Strain]( in reverse!
<|endoftext|>Fire off some tardigrades, they can survive almost anywhere (even in space if they hibernate), maybe they are already aliens?
<|endoftext|>Can most animals drink from the ocean? I always thought they went for rivers, lakes etc water without the salt
<|endoftext|>This is why I come here! You and the dude you're responding to, sorry I'm on mobile and didn't copy his screen name lol, both bring up awesome arguments. Both of which I never thought of.
<|endoftext|>Not really sure there's great evidence for mental projection. Human intelligence goes in all directions, not just scientific ones. It's just that the scientific method is the only way of "thinking" that has actually got humans past the atmosphere. Those advancements came about as a direct result of humans learning to control states of energy via physical means. Because we have little evidence of thought projection, an astral plane, or remote viewing (that'll trigger some folks on here), it's more grounded and rational to assume any extraterrestrial intelligence that is visiting us is doing so using technology. It just appears to be magic because it's tiers above our own. By all means, link your evidence of thought projection, etc. I'm just noting that if I could see the pyramids, reliably and with clarity, through astral projection or the like- I and many others would just do that instead of buying plane ticket.
<|endoftext|>It is said to be the teaching of the scientology. That an alien overlord called "Xenu" threw various alien races into a volcano and ever since these spirits roam earth
<|endoftext|>Interesting read but it becomes more impenetrable the longer it goes on. Seems a bit obnoxious like those guys who are saying people are going to go to the 5th dimension on Monday. Seems like this guy is from the U.K. based on some of his spellings.
<|endoftext|>I don't know if it is the same lot, i.e. the Annunaki  but for the Annunaki it is said that it was incidental to their goal on earth that they made us. Some of their number "went native" while on Earth exploiting it's gold, to the disgust of the others. So we humans are all descended from the rape babies resulting from Alien "beastiality".
<|endoftext|>That would literally never happen anywhere, anymore than an 'infinite number of monkeys' could randomly design, build and fly a Jumbo jet liner.But, if you think about it, that did happen. If you consider we are monkeys and we build jet liners then (waaait for it), *who wrote the Genetic Code?*
<|endoftext|>Im not really sure we can handle the truth. I think a subset of aliens are essentially cosmic grifters, they might make secret contact. Maybe to encourage us not to completely trash the place, but only because they stop by occasionally, then they book it before somebody tries to dissect them.Abductions might be solely to get data for their doomsday devices that goes off when it detects a viable but primitive FTL test. Or just xenopology majors on a field trip/gene poachers.Joe Exotic type degens from space Florida that enjoy space tweak and fucking with dangerous animals. I mean whole cities of human scumbags own pickup trucks and boats who could never build one themselves from scratch. Maybe occasional missionary type, they actually think they're doing us favor by stealing our 'Support Single Moms: Tip Your Stripper' bumper magnets. None of them see us as equals. I tend to think the fact they haven't stolen any moons we know of and haven't destroyed us just supports the viewpoint that they're hiding from the real danger.
<|endoftext|>The problem is even if they tell us the truth now there will still be some people who think that's a conspiracy also. Like I am certain that the U.S has made their own UFO'S just due to the Falcon Lake incident alone and our constant obsession with UFOS. So the problem is for me now is how do I trust that the government is even showing us genuine UFOS and not replicas they made their selves for higher purposes like false flag attacks or to falsely unite us so they can herd us like sheep just to slaughter their enemies? It's worrying because they can do so much with the scenario if they act like the UFOS.
<|endoftext|>There are many different ways to view them, are we like grazing cows to them? Or soaring birds? They are obviously good at hiding for some reason...
<|endoftext|>A little of both. While I don't (fully) believe They're doing it for the nightmare creature scenario, I also don't believe it to be beyond possibility.I see no reason that They wouldn't try to do such a thing if They truly believed that They could control such creatures. To what end They would really use them, and how, I haven't the foggiest. I just stick with my usual stance: I'm plenty happy to be wrong about it, because if I'm right we're screwed.
<|endoftext|>Yes, it was highly radioactive. It was a radio communication device. Arrogant rulers who thought they could go near it like Aaron, the high priest was free to do, were in for a swift and rude awakening. The priests went through elaborate rituals to protect themselves. Even prostration had a practical purpose of shielding the eyes from God's "glory". Everything and every detail had a protective and practical purpose. The way he makes the case for the redefinition of some of the most common religious words like holy and sin, is mind-blowing. It is highly etymological research, but it all logically fits together like a jigsaw puzzle, as was mentioned in a review of the book.
<|endoftext|>Also you said you did just order this book. If you are interested, please let me know when you finish it or while you are reading it, to talk about it. One other person I recommended it to said they would buy it, but Im not sure if they did. I would love to talk to someone else who has read it and compare mental notes.
<|endoftext|>Agreed. The Bible is full of references to alien entities and sophisticated technology which hardly anyone knows how to operate.
<|endoftext|>lol im not sure i would call it what you call it but you're speaking to one of those many right now. shit sucks. to put it extremely lightly. "electronic assault on targeted individuals" is the very very tip of the iceberg.
<|endoftext|>Right! We also see 8 in nature (e.g. spiders, octopuses and etc). Maybe aliens have 8 appendages, or have tentacles rather than hands/fingers and etc. Id like to see other non-humanoid aliens, but I dont think theyre ever mentioned.
<|endoftext|>I enjoyed the fact that they were attempting communication with an alien species instead of rushing for war instantly.
<|endoftext|>Yeah I loved the scene where Charlie Sheen's character chases one into the alley and it's legs bend backwards and it jumps onto the roof. I thought it was cool.
<|endoftext|>Dinosaurs have been running on 2 legs for a lot longer than mammals have. In biology, you don't have to be perfect if good enough gets your genes passed down to the next generation. Though you're right, bipedal mammals are certainly funky critters.
<|endoftext|>Wow. Ive never thought of that. Great idea!Do you think its to traverse our landscape or to make it look more like us so we could relate? Im thinking the former, since species like greys look way different than us. But then again, an advanced life form might think a grey looks like us, the same way we think all ants look the same.
<|endoftext|>Didn't Kennedy do that too before he died? Or was that about the CIA?Who else tried to warn us?(IMO, just cause they tried to "warn" us doesn't mean they cared about we the people or had our best interest at heart. Esp if they only try to tell us on their way out the door.)
<|endoftext|>Lmao no toilet paper EVER AGAIN.. cats n dogs running around all full of shit and piss and period blood from ppl using them as wipes because ppl bought up all the towels and tee shirts and fabrics and everything they could possibly use to wipe their ass. Shitty distopia - Shitopia
<|endoftext|>I dont doubt It. And I wouldnt be surprised. Thats like one of the only ways to get ppl to not only submit to a one world government but actually beg for It to protect them. In fact I cant even think of a better way or even ANY another way to achieve this.
<|endoftext|>The Covid thing is right, but I feel like an actual threat that is otherworldly would freak people out a bit more...As shitty as this may sound, there is treatment (debatable, but another can of worms) for the ailments you listed. They're putting in draconian stipulations for continuing life for Covid so people have a false sense of security but they shortened the leash on us most likely indefinitely, although I guess you could argue that something similar might happened if alien presence was made known, kind of like how the War on Terror, and now The Virus, after 9/11 did. Doesn't work, makes people feel good, because collectively we _are_ irrational, the general public, when push comes to shove. For most disasters there's some kind of warning system, if not knowledge ahead of time to have time to evacuate.With Covid people can simply stay inside since we can work, buy food, and, hell, things like cars online if they are genuinely fearful. I know people that do it. I think it's more fear of not listening to authority at this point for most than being truly, really afraid of a virus. Things would be way uglier if people as a whole were really, truly frightened. People physically fought over TP and shit canned food, as if there's no way to clean yourself or better foods to eat and carry with you on the go than those two. So, I have no doubt people would flip their shit and that a lot would use it as an excuse to do pretty much what they did with the BLM/Antifa summer and the first couple months of COVID.If actual contact was made and they're malicious in any way, shape or form, I will take a natural disaster any day of the week over an extremely advanced society that is NOT human or terrestrial in any way (and the fact that they would want anything to do with us, like how we would be interested in lesser life forms on other planets, is worrisome enough, to me), so we have no real idea if they experience anything like empathy like humans and other animals... and look where we are, for all the good our own ability to feel empathy has gotten us at this point in time.It seems like a good way to round up a bunch of terrified people, to me, at any rate.Not to mention that if people are afraid of COVID, and previously, terrorists, aliens and their extraterrestrial bacteria or viruses would almost definitely be a show stopper for us.Taking all of that into consideration, I personally do not think most people could handle it, as at that point they've (we've) been lied to our whole lives and have to deal with that, plus combined with the order of magnitude of actually knowing that we've been communicating with them, and that abductions would be true... nope.
<|endoftext|>It doesn't worry you because it's all conjecture and theory right now. I think people who are saying the scenario above wouldn't scare them if it came to be are either not very self aware, or being dishonest with themselves.If the government came out and basically said the following, of course people would be scared and to think anything else is, frankly, just kind of ignorant or arrogant. "Yeah, we know they're here, but we don't know much, other than they are much more technologically advanced, well beyond our capabilities and they can conduct operations on Earth with impunity. We know they're interested in our genetics and likely that of some animals and that they have taken both, but that's all we know and all we can do is monitor them at this time"
<|endoftext|>And I'd want to kill them and take it. There are a whole range of responses that could happen.Edit: after further thought, I would actually prefer taking it, and them alive for interrogation purposes, assuming we could also get a translator.
<|endoftext|>Reminds me of a theory I read that these entities are actually demons. Not saying this is true but would explain why the phenomena stops in the name of Jesus
<|endoftext|>Yea my sleep paralysis/night terrors which sometime I would constitute as being attacked by negative or demonic entities (enough that I realize there are different types that attack in different ways) but when they started to get really bad a year ago I remember out of nowhere when I was under attack in paralysis - I started praying or calling to Jesus and it stopped, dont know why or where it came from but it worked. So I searched and found out that a lot of people use the name of Jesus or prayer for similar things and it works. Totally blows my mind because even though I was raised catholic I never practiced it or prayed-but am extremely spiritual and believe if Christ lived he was just a higher density being with the embodiment of Light (Christ consciousness etc.) that came here for the reason he did and less about the Churchs description but for some reason some of these entities/forces/beings run from the name of Jesus or prayer. Sometimes like you cant even finish praying its like you forget and stop in your words, even though I know those prayers by heart, weird. I think my consciousness has definitely been somehow taken to other places that feel like home and are almost always awesome experiences. But those are different from what Im talking about , I think somehow the dark come from lower dimensions when Im dreaming/traveling and somehow hop back on as Im traveling back into my body and hold me in this in between so that my eyes are open and Im aware, but I cant move and I feel them touching grabbing me or on top or behind me or sometimes like they are trying to like rape me( look up succubus and incubus) and its fucking foul and feels gross but you cant shown fear thats what they want. Usually it feels like a tug of war of energy ,getting closer to being awake and being able to move or the opposite which is hard to describe but its like the dementors in Harry Potter and when they are winning it puts me in like a dream vision thing where Im in my room and I can finally SEE in physical form what being is attacking me (they shapeshift to from insect bug or crab like creatures to big classic looking demonic form) and it tries to keep me from waking and sometimes I can fight it by throwing Light at it or praying to it almost like the priest in exorcist and it shrinks and kinda falls back its weird and it sounds delusional but after hundreds of these experiences in less than a year and knowing and feeling what I do about the universe .. its hard not to believe what I FEEL and know whats happening is real, just everyone else thinks Im hallucinating or dreaming.
<|endoftext|>So that makes me wonder; is this karmic war being waged universally or is it only on 'Earth'? Is there something unique about 'Earth' that makes it the center of such grand dimensional focus?
<|endoftext|>Because maybe to them Earth IS their lab and we ARE the product. According to some of the whistleblowers, the entities refer to us as "containers". If they genetically modified and domesticated humans for the purpose of genetic and biological harvesting, then their doing these things regularly makes sense.
<|endoftext|>But youll get mocked if you suggest Darwins theory of evolution might be bullshit, even though he himself never competed his theory.Like for fucks sake the guy behind evolution NEVER FINISHED HIS THEORY but people want you to blindly believe we mutated from chimps over thousands of years, even though no chimp/human hybrids exist.
<|endoftext|>Ah, I was trying to stay away from triggering anyone, haha, I'm not claiming that any of those things are actually possible - at least to us humans here and now. Rather, I'm saying that aliens, who might not have humanoid bodies, might be capable of such things. Might. Perhaps. The fact we as a species can wrestle with all sorts of problems, can think and dream, all in our heads, suggests to me anything is possible. Then again, maybe hitting shit with sticks, and making better sticks, is the peak of our existence!
<|endoftext|>No I dont think it was the same person at all. The one on 4chan was a lot darker than that god like productions. It was straight up we hate you, your our slaves, and a ton of you are about to be wiped out. It made me really uneasy after reading it, hoping its a larp.The only good part of it was that part I referenced where the dude said his only real fear is that our ancestors will return for us. And even that he said he just looks at as a new challenge.I think they even alluded to the reptilian theory, like they didnt say it right out but I got the impression, like they said they werent us, and WE are the aliens...God I wish I could find it.
<|endoftext|>Even when I type your name in directly it says Im unable to message this account wtf is going on? Lol
<|endoftext|>Yeah I dont mind messaging you but when I go into your profile the message option isnt showing up? Wtf? and why isnt my link showing up? This is weird
<|endoftext|>That might explain the war between factions. Maybe some have something akin to a sense of loyalty to the descendants of that experiment (or claim ownership thereof.) There are a lot of questions that I hope will be answered one day soon. We're like the angry teen who just isn't ready to find out who his daddy really is.
<|endoftext|>It makes the most sense to me. Darwinism doesn't make any sense to me, if we evolved purely from monkeys why did no other animals evolve along with us?
<|endoftext|>A. The age of a theory has no bearing on its validity, geocentrism is much older than heliocentrism.B. I **REALLY** doubt you have evidence of alien human hybrids, but I'd be happy to see it.
<|endoftext|>All very good points. That last paragraph about hiding from the real danger is quite chilling and very likely to be true. There is an entire universe full of unexplored danger out there- no doubt there are things they fear/avoid. Probably would blow our minds and keep us from sleeping at night if we knew.This subject has sparked sort of a lifelong intrigue for me. My personal experiences were terrifying at first, but I attribute those feelings more to an instinctive (primitive) human fear of anything with physiological traits that resemble an apex predator. Over time, I managed to accept what I experienced and curiosity/wonder began to replace those visceral emotions.
<|endoftext|>I will need good convincing its actual aliens if there is disclosure. It seems way more likely for tptb to fake it. With all the advanced tech they have in secret it would be too easy, and be easier to explain than ftl or time travel. I dont know what would convince me other than interacting with a being itself.
<|endoftext|> I just stick with my usual stance: I'm plenty happy to be wrong about it, because if I'm right we're screwed.This statement can defend literally everything. Why be happy to be wrong rather than critical of how you think in an effort to better understand the world and it's risks?
<|endoftext|>More importantly, why mine gold on Earth where it is rare and hard to get, when it is plentiful in the asteroid belt and other places more easily accessible?
<|endoftext|>Oh would actually love to compare our thoughts. The book should arrive sometimes after Jan 4. Do you have any thoughts that you would like to share now? Maybe some things to look out for as i continue reading the bible
<|endoftext|>I also just ordered it based on your recommendation. I am very interested in this stuff I would love to talk to you after I read it.
<|endoftext|>So youre saying my cat is NOT an alien? What about the toxoplasmosis g. that has prlly taken up residence in both of our brains (and guts?)
<|endoftext|>I think they want to interface or experience things in the flesh, so every once in a while they take humanoid shape. Then it depends on the tech they have, might not get quite human.I am thinking that's why they also need the 57 genders - so they can be harder to spot in the wild.Look at Zuckerberg, for example. If that is how he looked 30 years ago, people would've freak out, now we have at least 20-30 weirder looking genders than this guy. He just has a reptilian, dead feel about him, but is less weird looking than half of CHAZ.
<|endoftext|>Sleep paralysis is not an attack ... I mean i believe in a lot of stuff... but sleep paralysis when you understand and practice meditation is nothing . I mean, you dont ever experience a bad situation because you would be able to "manage" sleep paralysis and turn it quickly into lucid dream.
<|endoftext|>Nah I haven't watched the continuation, I'm talking about the mythology from the original run. The myth arc episodes are pretty confusing but there are sites that outline. Basically the "aliens" on the show evolved on earth before humans, then they experienced some disaster where a few left on ships but most went into some kind of hibernation as the black oil if you remember that. Well in the shows mythology they have returned around the 1950s and worked out a deal with the deep state for an orderly apocalypse, except both sides are betraying each other.
<|endoftext|>We didn't descend from chimps. We share a common ancestor which was very different from humans and chimps.
<|endoftext|>Damn. Well, take everything with a grain of salt until evidence presents itself. At the end of the day, we can manifest whatever we fixate on
<|endoftext|>The Sumerian myths talk about pretty much exactly this - an interesting read/listen if you've got the time.
<|endoftext|>I think some form of evolution does happen with organisms on earth, but that it doesn't explain humans. Nor some other complex developments. Darwin himself knew his theory lacked credibility when it came to the evolution of the eye, for example:To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.From the Origin of Species, CHAPTER VI--DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORYI think something happened in antiquity, outside of "Darwinian" evolution, that resulted in our "unnatural" line of development and the onset of our "complex consciousness".
<|endoftext|>You say you would be happy to see evidence, but your words betray that you have already rejected it.
<|endoftext|>I've been looking for the answer for a long time. I have concluded recently that the source of this evil has to be a break-away human civilization. I've ruled out the British, the Zionists, any Bug-like Aliens, and 'The Devil' as being the culprits. No, they were just the scapegoat. Instead, we're talking about a distant society of human-beings that has needed to continuously leach Earth's resources (and women) over the last few milena. They are happy when we are obedient, but when we get too unruly, another 9/11 happens.**Martial Law. Marshalling. Marching. Mergers. Martyrdom. Murder.** These familiar terms of conquest are named after the planet of conquest: **Mars**. The origins of these words suggest systems of control imposed upon us by humans who associate themselves with the planet Mars.**They live on the inside**. All planets are [hollow]( Not [Flat]( [Hollow]( nicer on the inside, however resources are limited. This is why they have to leach off of Earth's resources.
<|endoftext|>I absolutely agree with that chastisement. I don't mean to say that I never dig deeper. That I settle on a point and then say 'meh'. It's... Hmmm... Optimistic pessimism, I guess would be what to call it, lol.I never stop digging, it's just that what I usually come to is all around not good. Not always so far out there as the creature scenario, but still things that I would rather not be true because of what else it would mean. But to consider what else it may mean requires more digging, more data. Sometimes, and more often with less data, I do use a bit of creative construction with what little I do have for the purpose of finding another track to try and follow to dig up something more concrete.That's not to advocate taking creative license with reality, but for me at least, coming up with something I know is totally cracked helps bring in to focus more realistic conclusions.Although, not that it fits all things, but how does the saying go? 'When all logical conclusions prove false, then we have no choice but to turn to the illogical.'Anyway. Always dig deeper, always question, especially our own conclusions. Untill there are no more assumptions in the logic, the thinking cannot be done.However, we cannot rule out that sometimes we have no choice but to be our own 'ninth man'. Not that the silly, cracked conclusion will be true, but if at least it is based on some actual possibilities, some real truths, it should not be entirely written off. While the silly parts may be off, what is true within it may lead to more realistic possibilities we may not have considered before.
<|endoftext|>Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.Here's a copy of ###[The Bible]( I a good bot? | [info]( | [More Books](
<|endoftext|>I have not read a lot of the Bible, but as pertains to the ark in particular, just to reflect upon a quote that has been used about it before, the one about any sufficiently advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic...
<|endoftext|>Sure, just DM me (or maybe we can even do a small chat with the other person who said theyre reading it too)
<|endoftext|>yes i have had it for years now. since roughly 2015-16. has not broken or given me reprieve since then. limited gangstalking as well. what is evp? also i believe it goes beyond TI. some of the things i have experienced are not explainable. people would not believe it if they experienced it themselves. so it goes without saying that i cant even explain it if i wanted to. call me crazy if you'd like. also what is evp?
<|endoftext|>Cats are definitely aliens. A sub class of the overlords, left behind because they are an invasive species. I dont hate them, they're just incredible predators.
<|endoftext|>no it is. you got the men in black cat, open its face and there's a little dude in a fat chair inside
<|endoftext|>I remember reading an article years and years ago, I believe it was from an Antropologist who believed that based on our anatomy, humans might be the only being on Earth who experience back pain as just a normal part of life (not including animals that suffer injuries). I don't recall all the details, but he explained all the anatomical reasons for his theory. I'm not sure if it's something accepted in the "mainstream", but I thought it was interesting and he had what sounded like valid anatomical reasons why.
<|endoftext|>I lucid dream and astral projection t, I recognize the difference between each separate experience. Im not saying every sleep paralysis is an attack. Im telling you Ive had my paralysis been abused and turned into attacks. Have you ever experienced sleep paralysis or something similar?
<|endoftext|>Yes I agree, evolution is clear to me, but I don't believe that it's the only thing that has influenced our development or made us who we are.
<|endoftext|>So do you have evidence or not? Am I not worthy of the evidence because I'm critical of the idea that a completely foreign lifeform could sexually reproduce with humans?
<|endoftext|>He may mean ESP, as my targeting started within weeks of my first successful remote viewing hit. And I mean, spot on, knew within the first 10 seconds what the target was that I was viewing. A week later I got followed by at least a dozen different vehicles who tailgated me with their high beams on, received texts from unknown numbers that refused to answer saying they hope I get back with my ex of 2 years, and random strangers waiting in my neighborhood to call me by a nickname that no one has called me in years and only a handful of people know about. Even my most open minded friends cant believe some of the shit I tell them is happening, even when they literally are seeing it as it happens. Shit has made me so distrusting of everyone, and the shit that happens sometimes drives me to the brink of insanity and back again, only making me fight harder against it.Feel free to reach out if you ever want to talk my friend. Finding other T.I.s who believe and understand what is going on is so rare.
<|endoftext|>Might not be THAT foreign, maybe all life has one genesis and just got tracked all over the carpet by aliens a few billion years ago but it all still works the same? I find idea odd, seems like something closer to a virus infecting a host, or eliminating an enemy by slowly making them into an copy of yourself, like cultural imperialism, than 'hybridization' but I suppose it's possible. Just no evidence.
<|endoftext|>"But it all still works the same"? **If** life got tracked here by aliens billions of years ago it would have nothing to do with modern life. Early lifeforms didn't even have mitochondria in their cells.
<|endoftext|>Asking in bad faith is not asking in skepticism. I have no intention of deceiving, I am open about the fact that that I don't believe aliens have visited Earth. Weird that you refuse to share your beliefs with those who question them.
<|endoftext|>As moderators, if we try to approve the comment it is simply returned to the spam filter time and time again.
<|endoftext|>I'm saying might only be one physically possible way for life to evolve generally? Like the basic chemistry doesn't change. Its worlds apart but the ideas are transferable with enough skills to implement it. Maybe it's just interesting to see the variety or sometimes it does unique things in unique environments?I don't really believe any abduction stories are factually true. I think some of the people who claim them genuinely do though. I tend to think if any truth to it at all would be something best explained as gene poaching basicly.
<|endoftext|>Evolution absolutely does unique things in unique environments, adaptation to environment is the whole jam of evolution. Basic chemistry doesn't change, but the biology resulting from it has incredible variety. Think of all the variety of life on earth, and then consider that all life that has mitochondria in their cells probably descends from a common ancestor cell that happened to consume another cell that happened to work well with it.
<|endoftext|>Well then I'll leave you with this, putting aside the fact that hybrids are almost never fertile, why would humans be able to breed with aliens yet we cannot breed with our closest relative, chimpanzees?
<|endoftext|>That's a better technical explanation I'm no biology major. We've started using computers to generate molecules that 'might' tend to make a good drug for some purpose but we wouldn't turn down a freebie from nature either.
<|endoftext|> "So we humans are all descended from the rape babies resulting from Alien 'beastiality'." - You
<|endoftext|>So I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you don't seem to understand the meaning of the verb "descend" or the noun "hominid": The theory is the aliens bred with the earth **hominids** they encountered on earth, and the eventual result of that union was "modern" humans.
<|endoftext|>I had just read it earlier and was just so gobsmacked by the idea of someone genuinely believing they're descended from aliens and humans banging.
<|endoftext|>That's besides the point. You completely misunderstand the realities of breeding between species and yet have the gall to act condescending and link dictionary articles. Why would aliens with totally foreign biology and anatomy be able to produce offspring with early hominids, let alone fertile offspring. Are you aware that when you breed a horse and a donkey their offspring is infertile? If two members of the same genus cannot produce fertile offspring how do you propose a species from a different class (at minimum) would produce a hybrid?
<|endoftext|>That's besides the point. I disagreeyet have the gall to act condescending and link dictionary articles.You clearly didn't know the specific meanings of those wordsWhy would aliens with totally foreign biology and anatomy be able to produce offspring with early hominids, let alone fertile offspring. Are you aware that when you breed a horse and a donkey their offspring is infertile? If two members of the same genus cannot produce fertile offspring how do you propose a species from a different class (at minimum) would produce a hybrid?These questions are predicated on the assumption that alien biology would operate within the same constraints as the biology of life on planet earth. I am aware of the typical laws of biology on earth that you describe. However, I am open to it not being the complete universal story of what is possible, biologically speaking..
